1. Introduction and motivation 
 
When investigating a computer crime, one of the core concepts and main challenges in digital forensics is 
to “put fingers on keyboard”, that is to identify the human who is responsible for the generation or handling 
of digital data related to the respective criminal or offensive activity in general (Shavers, 2013). The 
increased complexity and large scope of the underlying problem space, makes circumstantial digital evidence 
critical when attempting to identify a user. 
Textual communication between users dominates most other forms such as audio, video or image. For 
every second, there are about 2.4 million emails sent (internetlivestats.com). A typical incident relating to 
textual communication is a masquerade attack, where a malicious user assumes the identity of another 
legitimate user. To date, email spoofing detection is mainly focused to the examination of the email metadata 
found on the headers and its correlation with network information, such as IP addresses, geo-location, and so 
forth. Focus is not given to verifying the individual. However, there exists a wealth of research literature on 
biometric based authentication of users based on the way a user types (Clarke et. al, 2003, Clarke & Furnell, 
2007) yet current email applications do not record the biometric characteristics of the author and therefore 
biometric based identification techniques are not applicable in such a context. Hence, in order to adopt 
biometric authentication approaches in identification of user characteristics, the authoring applications need 
to maintain biometric data recording capabilities. Adding such abilities to authoring applications would offer 
a number of benefits and protection to the users. Consider for example a system that can identify the gender 
of the author. Masquerading is a popular behavior in Internet applications such as social networks, associated 
to various offenses (phishing, pedophilia, etc.). A system that would have the ability to warn or inform the 
unsuspected recipient of a message about the gender of the sender of that message, would act as a deterrent 
towards offenses leveraging gender misrepresentation, it would increase the protection of the legitimate users 
and of course support investigations in case of a reported incident. 
In this paper we propose the use of keystroke analysis in order to determine the gender of a user. We 
investigate the validation of such hypothesis in order to develop a business case for creating applications that 
include functionality for allowing gender identification of the creator of the text, while this text is being 
typed. We envisage that the proposed method will provide a forensic analyst with enough circumstantial 
evidence to support their investigation and perform e-discovery through informed decision making. 
More specifically, the proposed system is based on a scenario where user authentication has failed (a user 
account has been hijacked for example) and there is no biometric database available to identify the attacker 
by matching the attacker’s typing behavior against a set of user biometric profiles. Having limited 
information and a high level of uncertainty, the identification of the characteristics of the attacker, such as 
gender in our case, is expected to have an amount of false prediction rate. In addition, privacy requirements 
prohibit the logging and capturing of the type text. As such we argue that the monitoring of keystroke 
durations rather than the actual content would be a privacy tradeoff a user willing to accept. That is, a 
legitimate user may be willing to accept some degradation in privacy (which may already be the case for 
users subscribing to biometric authentication based on keystroke duration), in order to support an 
investigation in case of an authentication breach by allowing the creation of circumstantial evidence which, 
when combined with other evidence will eventually allow the identification of the attacker. Such 
circumstantial evidence for example could be fused with other methods, such as those described by Schler et 
al. (2006) and Rangel et al.(2013) who focus on the identification of both gender and age of an author by 
analyzing the content of a message. 
The rest of the paper is organised as follows. In the Section 2 the related work on gender recognition 
within written text is examined. The experimental design and methodology are presented in Section 3, with 
the accompanying results documented in Section 4. The paper concludes with Section 5 presenting the key 
findings and future work. 
 
 
2. Related Work 
The question of indentifying the gender of a writer intrigued researchers since texts were only in 
handwritten form. Trudgill (1972) highlights the differences in linguistic styles between male and female

authors of a handwritten text. Similarly, there are plenty of works studying the differences that appear 
between males and females in speech and informal writing, like the work of Holmes (1988), for instance. 
Gender identification is an interesting topic with a number of useful applications, such as better 
translation between languages as some languages employ different grammatical structures depending on the 
gender, the targeted advertising for Internet users, and of course forensic analysis. 
The research community has done a significant amount of work on gender and user identification in 
general, by proposing a number of techniques with varying prediction success rates. In his work, Lai (2006) 
constructed datasets from books and blogs, and proposed a Naïve-Bayes classifier on a selection of words 
achieving a success rate between 64% and 91%, depending on the particular set of features. 
De Vel et al. (2002) acknowledge the proliferation of e-mail as a modern means of communication, 
combining old and new characteristics of written speech; the new characteristics refer to the abbreviations – 
frequently found in text chatting – as well as intentionally misspelled words done by the author of a message 
in order to convey emotional information. They collected e-mails from an academic organization comprised 
of approximately 15,000 members and trained a system using a large number of features, such as, the 
number of characters, lines, paragraphs, alphabetic characters, upper-case characters, spaces, words ending 
with “able”, words ending with “al”, “sorry” words, and so forth. They achieved a success rate, depending on 
the size of e-mail, of between 56% and 71%. 
In a similar manner, more recently, Cheng et al. (2011) used a dataset from e-mails and journalist’s 
articles and utilized three different classifiers to achieve a success rate between 55% and 85%. The features 
they selected included; the number of lines, paragraphs, sentences, some special characters, like “%”, “&”, 
the number of punctuations, articles, pronouns, auxiliary-verbs, and so forth, as well as the presence of some 
particular words. Schler et al. (2006) used tens of thousands blogs to as a dataset and based on the 
appearance frequency of a selection of words they categorized a user according the gender and age. Rangel 
et al. (2013) present the findings of the Author Profiling Task, as announced at the PAN 2013 workshop for 
authorship identification. This work contains a consolidated list of the literature as seen by the 21 candidates 
who tried to classify an author of an English or Spanish text according to gender and age. Argamon et al. 
(2003) used documents from the British National Corpus and checked the frequency of appearance of 
pronouns, common nouns, proper nouns, as well as the frequency of appearance of some particular words, 
both in fiction and nonfiction texts. Using a Bayesian technique they achieved a success rate of 80%. Based 
on this research a tool named “Gender Genie” was developed (Gender Genie, nd.). The tool allocates a 
number of points either on a “male” or on a “female” variable, every time a particular word appears. The 
highest variable of the two indicate the gender of the author. Another tool is the “Gender Guesser” (n.d.), 
which is based on “Gender Genie” but is more advanced in the sense that it can process informal writing 
often found in blogs and casual messages. However, in order to perform with an improved prediction rate the 
tool requires a minimum of 300 words. Similarly, another tool is “uClassify” (n.d.) which has been trained 
on 11,000 blogs, half of which were written by male and the other half female authors. 
A common characteristic of all of the research published to date is that they are language dependent. 
More specifically, they require that the language is specified – English in particular. Consequently, other 
languages such as Spanish, Chinese, Greek, German and so forth would require additional training with 
respective datasets. This requirement results in a significant limitation (Doyle and Keselj, 2005). Despite the 
acknowledgement of the language dependency limitation, the solution proposed by Doyle and Keselj is 
language dependent, but it is relatively simple to adapt it for other languages. In their work 500 student 
essays were used and the appearances of n-grams (a character, a digram, a trigram, etc.) for both male and 
female authors were obtained offering a success rate between 51% and 81%. Giot and Rosenberger (2012) 
claim to have introduced the first language independent gender recognition system. This was achieved using 
keystroke duration, digram latency and a vector which is the concatenation of the four previous timing 
values. They achieved a success rate of 90% and use it to improve user authentication. The main limitation 
of the work by Giot and Rosenberger (2012) is the focus on the protection of passwords. That is, the users 
were profiled based on their typing of two specific words (Giot  et al., 2009). 
Summarizing, almost the entire work on gender recognition of an author, is based on what a user types. 
The underlying models depend on appearance frequency of particular words, n-grams, punctuations, and so 
forth, making these approaches language dependent. To our knowledge, our proposed work is the first study 
focusing on how users type a complete passage rather than a few words such as a password. The method is 
language independent because is not subject to particular words of a specific language, but to time 
parameters related to the way a user types.

Our proposed work aims at providing continuous identification throughout a typing session. In addition, 
provided that our approach involves the collection of a larger volume of user data, we could reduce the 
number of required attributes, improving the efficiency of the gender identification system. 
 
 
3. Keystroke-Based Gender Experiment 
 
3.1. Experimental Methodology 
In this work we attempt to perform gender recognition of the author of a text using a limited number of 
attributes and more particularly the parameters of keystroke dynamics. This suggests that the proposed 
recognition system is language independent, because the results are based on the way the user types rather 
than what they type. Furthermore, in order to have a system with increased user acceptance and reduced non-
compliance risks due to possible privacy regulations, the keystroke features utilized are limited to the 
keystroke duration.  Nevertheless, maintaining a dataset of keystroke duration information will allow the 
construction of other related attributes such as digram – or n-gram in general – based latencies, thus 
supporting further investigation and identification of the attribute of the highest accuracy. 
Unfortunately, to date there seems to be a limited number of public datasets of keystroke dynamic, 
therefore it was necessary to design a data collection methodology and implement a data collection tool. A 
key logging application was developed in Visual Basic. The application upon recording the user with a 
suitable unique identifier required the user to type a fixed text of 850 characters containing letters, digits, and 
other symbols. Upon completion of the typing exercise, a comma-separated file was created named after the 
subject’s username, with each line containing the character pressed, the keydown and keyup time in 
milliseconds. Whilst it is possible to capture keystroke characteristics with a greater resolution, prior 
research within this domain when applied to authentication have typically focused upon milliseconds (Joyce 
and Gupta, 1990).Each typing session is captured in a single file. That is, if a user for example participates in 
two different sessions (say by running the experiment twice – one on a laptop and one on a desktop), two 
files will be created. The times recorded are measured as the time elapsed from the execution of the 
keylogger application. 
 
An initial team of 24 volunteers used the keylogger application both on desktops and laptops. All 
volunteers typed the same text twice – one on a laptop and one on a desktop – producing 2 files respectively, 
in order to cover a wide variety of typing cases. The recording period was undertaken from 11/10/2012 until 
21/11/2012 and from 13/07/2014 until 15/07/2014. Whilst the number of participants is not large, careful 
thought was given to their selection, to ensure an appropriate representation. This involved controlling for 
gender and left-right handedness. The volunteers’ characteristics with respect to the general population 
representation, are shown in Table I. The number of participants who were male was equal to the number of 
female volunteers. The proportion of left-handed volunteers was about 12.5%, closely reflecting the 
proportion of the whole population. The educational level of the participants corresponds to the ratio of the 
level of education of a population with a Greek nationality.

3.2 Descriptive Statistics 
After the recording period, 48 files, 24 corresponding to male authors and 24 to female authors, were 
available for training the system. From these files the keystroke durations of every key that was pressed were 
extracted and all the records from “male” files were merged to produce a single dataset; the same procedure 
was followed for the “female” files – creating the two classes of interest. 
The dataset was sanitized by removing all outliers that corresponded to values exceeding three times the 
mean value, a standard methodological approach utilized in keystroke analysis studies (Clarke & Furnell, 
2007). Subsequently, the statistical features for each character were calculated to find if there are any 
differences in the way that type the members of the two classes. Although the sample was not too big, some 
important differences appeared (as illustrated in Table II).

It should be noted that significant differences are not limited to the characters of Table II, but are 
encountered almost in half of the tested character set. Some characters display significant differences in their 
mean value, others in the standard deviation and some in both. As a general observation of these preliminary 
findings is that the males hold their fingers a little bit longer on the keys than the females, while the females 
are not as consistent as males are, due to the slightly higher standard deviations. 
The normality and subsequent t-test results between the means of the two classes are shown in Table III. 
As it can be seen from the Shapiro-Wilk normality test, both classes are normal, permitting us to run a paired 
t-test in order to establish whether the means of the two classes are different. The resulting probability was 
equal to 0.0001 indicating that the means of the two classes are significantly different and therefore the key 
latency attribute can be used to distinguish the gender of the author.

3.3 Classifier Design and Evaluation 
In this work we constructed and evaluated three classifiers, namely a Naïve Bayes, and two classifiers 
based on the Manhattan and Euclidean distance respectively. This is in agreement with the current relevant 
literature, where a considerable volume of research displayed preference to these classifiers and 
corresponding methods in a variety of different problem domains – see for example the work by Phyu 
(2009), Khamar (2013), Kotsiantis (2007). In addition, the rationale for selecting these specific three 
candidate classifiers was the significant differences in the statistical descriptors as well as the distribution 
types of the keystroke duration histograms, making thus these classifiers appropriate for the current work 
More specifically, the Naïve Bayes classifier was a suitable classifier since our attribute follows a normal 
distribution (Bouckaert, 2004). The significant differences of the standard deviations between the male and 
female keystrokes warrants the use and evaluation of the Manhattan distance (Li et al. 2005). Finally, the 
statistically significant differences between the two means are explored and utilized through the Euclidean 
distance. 
Firstly we examine the performance of a Naïve Bayes classifier. A histogram of keystroke duration 
appearances of a representative set of keys is shown in Figure 1.

where 
p(x|g) is the probability of “x” character being typed by user of gender “g”, 
µx,g and σx,g  is the mean value and the standard deviation of the data respectively, for the “x” 
character and for the “g” gender. 
 
Upon calculating the probability for each character, they are binned into the two classes as follows: 
 
Male_Accumulator = p(‘A’|male) + p(‘B’|male) + … 
Female_Accumulator = p(‘A’|female) + p(‘B’|female) + … 
 
The final probabilities are then obtained from:

malep
__
_

+
=  
rAccumulatoFemalerAccumulatoMale
rAccumulatoFemale
femalep
__
_
)(
+
=  
 
It can be seen that p(male)=1-p(female). The higher of the two is the final gender guess. The success rate 
of the proposed system was 61.76%. 
As mentioned earlier, the observation that most of the characters exhibit significant differences in their 
standard deviations between “male” and “female” classes led us to evaluating the performance of the 
Manhattan distance. The Manhattan distance between the calculated standard deviation from that of “male” 
and “female” classes indicates the gender of the author of the text. In this experiment the correct predictions 
reached a success rate of 64.71%, but the results showed a bias towards the “male” class. 
The third approach was the exploitation of the differences between the means. The mean values of 
keystroke durations of specific characters were calculated and these values were compared with the 
respective values of “male” and “female” classes. The shorter distance indicates the author’s gender. Once 
again the test was performed over all available texts and for some characters the success rate was 67.65%.

However, one important drawback of this approach is the dependence upon a single character, reducing thus 
the reliability of its performance. 
To remedy this limitation consideration was given to the average values for a selection of characters 
separately, rather than an aggregate value for all characters. After this the Euclidean Distances from the 
values of model are calculated and the shorter of these indicates the author’s gender. More analytically, the 
following comparison was performed:

where  
tot_dur_x  is the sum of char “x” keystroke durations, 
count_x  is number of times char “x” was typed, 
µx,f and µx,m  are the mean values of char “x”’s keystroke duration from the data that were created 
by females and males volunteers, respectively. 
The success rate achieved was 64.71% and the system is not dependent on a single character, addressing 
the aforementioned limitation. 
After a thorough study of the above metrics and the corresponding results, a scoring system based on the 
Manhattan distance was introduced. For each different character the following comparison is performed: 
 
mxfx
xcount

,,

µµ −<−  (3) 
 
where tot_dur_x, count_x, µx,f and µx,m have the same meaning as the terms in expression (2). 
The outcome of (3) dictates how the weighted scoring system is to be applied. If (3) holds, the points will 
be assigned to the probability denoting that the text belongs to a female author. In the opposite case, the 
points are assigned to the probability of the male author. The number of assigned points depends on the 
appearance frequency of the character “x” in the text and on the difference between the values µx,f and µx,m of 
the model. 
The classifiers proposed in this work were also compared against SVM and decision tree classifiers. In an 
SVM classifier each volunteer file is represented as a data point in an n-dimensional space, where n denotes 
the number of attributes. In our case the attributes are the keystroke duration mean values. The objective of 
the classifier is to find a suitable hyperplane for splitting this n-dimensional hyperspace in such a way that 
male points are separated from female points. 
Any hyperplane can be written as the set of points x satisfying: 
 
0=−⋅ bxw  (4) 
 
where 
w is a normal vector to hyperplane, 
b is a real number, 
· denotes the dot product. 
By mapping the two classes to values +1 and -1 respectively, we can select two hyperplanes that separate 
the data points without having any other point in between. The hyperplanes will have the following 
equations: 
 
1=−⋅ bxw  and 1−=−⋅ bxw  (5) 
 
The distance of these two hyperplanes would then be 2/||w|| and therefore we seek to minimize ||w||, the 
norm of w, which can be replaced by ½ ||w||

However in practice it is not expected to fully separate all male from all female points. In such cases we 
seek to identify the hyperplane that achieves the best separation of the two classes. This is achieved by 
employing the Soft Margin approach that introduces non-negative slack variables, ξi, which measure the 
degree of misclassification of the data xi. As such, the optimization problem formally expressed by (6) with 
the constraints of (7) and the Lagrange multipliers (8), is formally written as:

4. Validation and results 
The scoring system considered expression (3) above and included weights for every character, depending 
on the appearance frequency of the character in the text and its difference between the two classes (male and 
female). That is, a frequently appearing character with a significant statistical difference would be given the 
maximum weight (5 points in our system), as opposed to a character appearing a limited number of times and 
having low differences between the classes (1 point). Group 1 involves the case of the volunteers that were 
used to both train and test the system. This group comprised of the volunteers described in Table I. 
The overall success rate of the proposed classifier for the dataset produced by Group 1 users was equal to 
81.25%. More analytically, the success rate for the “female” files was equal to 83.33%, whereas for the male 
files was equal to 79.17%. 
 
 
The validation of the constructed classifier was performed with two additional datasets. First, we invited a 
second group of volunteers. The usernames, gender and age of each member of the second group, as well as 
the device type that they were recorded on are shown in Table IV. 
 
 
[ INSERT TABLE IV HERE ] 
 
 
 
This group was asked to type the same control text as the first group, producing a total of 38 files, as two 
of the volunteers did not provide laptop typing data. The files produced by Group 2 were used to test the

system. In this case the classifier produced a success rate for “female” and “male” files equal to 76.47%, and 
71.43% respectively, with an overall success rate of 73.68%. 
The performance of the classifier is similar to those of the first group. That is, the difference in percentage 
of correct prediction is less than 8% with better results attributed to the “female” class. 
A third dataset was used to validate the language independence claim. This is a dataset produced by Bello 
et al. (2010). The dataset contains the keystroke logging of some particular sentences in Spanish and some 
particular UNIX commands from a team of 40 male and 15 female users, producing thus 55 files in total, 
which were used to test the system. 
After running the proposed classifier against Groups 2 and 3, it was established that the rates for both 
datasets were slightly higher than 69% and similar to the first group the classification success rate of the 
“female” class was equal to 73.33%, which was higher than the “male” class (67.50%), albeit the small 
number of characters included in the weighted calculation. As such, we conjecture that the more characters 
used, the better accuracy and reliability of the proposed method. 
By observing the classification rates of Groups 1, 2 and 3 it can be noted that the system predicts the 
gender three out of four users, correctly. This success rate is comparable with those of similar works, see 
Doyle and Keselj (2005), Argamon et al (2009), Cheng et al (2011). The advantage of the proposed method 
is that it monitors only the keystroke duration and hence the user’s privacy is respected. 
The classification rates of the Bayesian and Euclidean Distance classifiers were 57.69% and 65.38% for 
Group 2 files respectively, 58.18% and 61.81% for Group 3 files respectively, and the aggregate 
classification rates were 59.13% and 63.48% respectively. From these results we conclude that the classifier 
based on the Manhattan Distance yielded the highest classification rate. 
The proposed system was further evaluated and compared against an SVM and a decision tree classifier. 
For doing this, the SVM and C4.5 implementations of the WEKA machine learning software were used. 
Both systems had the same training set as the classifiers discussed earlier and the default parameter values 
were used. 
The success rates for the SVM classifier were 72.92% for Group 1, 68.42% for Group 2 and 43.64% for 
Group 3. From the results it can be seen that the SVM classifier has slightly worse rates than the Manhattan 
Distance based classifier for the first two groups, but its performance for the Spanish users is substantially 
low. Since the rate is below 50% we could construct an oracle with a 100-43.64=56.36 success rate by 
setting it to output the complement answer. However, even in this case the success rate is low. 
With regards to the C4.5 Decision Tree classifier the success rates were 93.75% for Group 1, 60.53% for 
Group 2 and 54.55% for Group 3. Unsurprisingly, the decision tree displayed a very high success rate for the 
training set, whilst the results for groups 2 and 3 were poor. This is due to the linear nature of the decision 
tree as well as the fact that it only selects those attributes from the training set that are capable of separating 
the classes of that set, whilst ignoring all other attributes. 
Table V summarizes the results for Manhattan Distance based, SVM and C4.5 Decision Tree classifier for 
Group 1. Likewise, Table VI summarizes the respective results for Group 2 and Table VII the results of the 
Spanish group (Group 3).

Table VIII shows the results by aggregating all files from all datasets for Manhattan Distance based, SVM 
and C4.5 Decision Tree classifiers.

Overall, SVM and C4.5 Decision Tree tests yield similar results but their success rates are less than the 
rate of the Manhattan Distance based classifier. All results are summarised in Table IX.

Finally, in order to assess the robustness of the proposed method we split each file from the second group 
of volunteers into two almost equal segments. We then applied the proposed method independently to each 
file. We define robustness as the ability of the system to consistently and repeatedly classify a user to the 
same gender, given any typing subset of that user. It can be seen from the results that the proposed method is 
consistent for 32 out of 38 files. 
The same process was followed for the Spanish dataset. From the total amount of 55 files, those that were 
smaller than 15K were excluded in order to maintain a workable amount of keystrokes, leaving a pool of 48 
files. The proposed method was consistent for 38 out of 48 files. 
Finally, tests were performed in order to establish whether statistically significant correlations exist 
between the success rates and the other attributes such as age and typing medium (laptop or desktop). As the 
dependent variable (prediction) is binary, we ran a Logit and Probit estimation on the data. None of the tests 
returned statistically significant results. That is, no valid conclusions can be drawn with regards to age and 
prediction accuracy from the datasets. 
 
 
5. Conclusions and Future Work 
Leveraging keystroke dynamics research to construct user profiles in the context of a digital investigation 
is a promising area of research and a domain with practical importance to electronic discovery. In this paper 
we focused on the feasibility of identifying whether a user typed a certain text is male or female, but a 
complete solution would need to consist of independent tests corresponding to a variety of characteristics or 
properties. Besides user authentication, keystroke dynamics may be useful to detect the emotional state of the 
user, or to identify his handedness, or to assess whether the user is typing in their native language or not. 
Due to the preliminary yet promising results, the model will be extended to consider other user 
characteristics or properties in order to form a concise and concrete solution. The complete approach which 
is part of our ongoing research involves the identification of correlation of the user properties through latent 
variables in order to establish the mutual information between them and the construction of a formal 
evidence handling framework based on known evidence fusion constructs such as the Dempster-Shafer 
theory of evidence. 
A limitation of the current research was the use of a fixed text to create the reference model, which 
departs from the realistic behavior of users. An improvement would be to use an agent that logs the user in a 
real working environment and we conjecture that this would increase the success rates. Another parameter 
increasing the prediction accuracy is a larger user sample. Finally, an improvement that will significantly 
raise the reliability of the system would be to create feedback mechanism, enhancing in this way the database 
that generated the equations for the possibilities export, and the weights of each character.
