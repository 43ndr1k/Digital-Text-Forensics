Studying the complexity of language has attracted the physicist’s attention recently. The methods
borrowed from the statistical mechanics; namely, the complex network theory, can be used for
exploring the regularities as a characteristic of complexity of language. In this paper, we focus on the
authorship identification by using the complex network approach. We introduce three metrics which
enable us for comparison the author’s writing styles. This approach was previously used by us for
finding the author of unknown book among collection of thirty six books written by five Persian
poets. Here, we select a collection of one hundred and one books of nine English writers and
quantify their writing styles according to our metrics. In our experiment, Shakespeare appears as the
best author who follows a unique writing style in all of his works. VC 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.

To every book we can associate a network, the words in
vocabulary play the role of nodes, an edge connects two
words if they occur in the same body of text together. The
author’s style in writing is characterized by network
measures that are assigned to his/her books in average.
Accordingly, the probability of writing an unknown book
by a given author can be determined by comparison of
the network measures for the unknown book and the
author’s books collection. In this work, such probabilities
are calculated for 909 book-author pairs in our collection
which contains one hundred and one books of nine
English writers. Based on these results, we propose three
metrics for assessing the writing style of authors.
I. INTRODUCTION
Language has been created and evolved in response to our
needs for communication with others. It is a complex adaptive
system.1 Zipf’s law and Heaps’ law are two empirical laws in
linguistics which explain the human language complexity.
They describing commonly observed characteristics of term
frequency distribution in corpora.2,3 Recently, physicists are
interested to find deep secrets of language using methods and
techniques of complex systems. Finding new complex features
in language, mechanism of birth, growth and death of lan-
guages, keyword detection and text summarization are some
issues that seem to have attracted physicists’ attention.4
Author attribution is one of the most considerable part of
the language studies.5–7 It is an interdisciplinary field and is
becoming to play an important role in areas such as informa-
tion retrieval, web information management, cognitive sci-
ence, law, literature and so on. Variety of methods and
techniques have been used for authorship identification and
stylometry of authors.5–7 We can classify them in two parts.
Some of them use the statistical features of text for identifying
the authorship. The other methods benefit from the neural net-
works for detection of writing styles. We do not discuss them
here because reviewing all of these methods is very lengthy
and it is not necessary for understanding the rest of the paper.
We refer the reader to review article of Stamatatos.7
In our recent work, we used the complex network
approach for authorship attribution of books.8 We showed it
is possible to characterize the author’s writing style by evalu-
ation of the network measures belonging to his books. We
examined our method for stylometry detection of five
Persian poets among collection of thirty six books. The
ninety two percent accuracy was obtained in our experiment.
Here, we collect a set of books in English, written by
some well known authors. In the first step, the network invar-
iants are computed for each author. Then, we calculate the
probability of writing a book by a given author for all possi-
ble book-author pairs in our collection. Some metrics are
introduced which use these results for evaluating the authors’
writing styles. It is worth noting that we do not take into con-
sideration the writing style from literary viewpoint. Here, the
stylistic author is a writer who can be identified through his
works or, in other words, be predictable.
The paper is organized as follow: In Sec. II, we describe
the necessary terminology in the field of complex networks
then our method for authorship identification is presented.
Section III is devoted to introducing the new metrics for
quantification of the author’s writing style and reporting the
results. In final section, we summarize our work.
II. NETWORK MEASURES FOR AUTHORSHIP
IDENTIFICATION
Nowadays the complex network theory appears as a
suitable tool for studying the complexity in systems. The
complexity is generally characterized by some topological
measures of the system’s associated network. For example,
the long range dependence in a sequence of words appears as
the scale free property or small world phenomenon in the
associated co-occurrence word network.9
To construct a model network for simulating any sys-
tem, we should specify what are the nodes? by which rules
they are linked? For a book, words in vocabulary can bea)darooneh@znu.ac.ir. Tel.: þ98 241 515 2545. Fax: þ98 241 515 2264.

considered as nodes and the co-occurrence of words deter-
mines the network links.
A network with N number of nodes, is represented math-
ematically by an NN matrix which is called the adjacency
matrix, A. Its elements, aij, are one or zero depending on
whether the, i-th and j-th nodes are linked or not. All the top-
ological measures of the network can be computed by some
algebraic operations on the adjacency matrix.
The degree of the i-th node is defined as the number of
links incident on it: ki ¼
P
j aij. The degree distribution p(k)
of a network is a feature that distinguishes between various
kind of networks. Using some assumptions in the context of
the nonextensive statistical mechanics that the co-occurrence
words network has the form of q–exponential distribution,
pðkÞ  ð1þ bðq 1ÞkÞ

1q.8 It is also proved directly from
special model for evolving the words network based on the
principle of preferential attachment without rewiring pro-
cess.13 Two parameters q and b should be determined by
regression. The scale free nature of the degree distribution is
exhibited by the parameter q, it is usually varies between 1.4
to 1.5 for different languages.8,10–13 The parameter b deter-
mines the range of validity of the scale free property.
The geodesic or shortest path between i-th and j-th nodes
is denoted as lij. The characteristic length, l is the average of
geodesics over all couple of nodes, l ¼
P
i<j lij=½NðN  1Þ.
We can assign a value to each node, between zero and
one which shows the ratio of the number of links between its
neighbors to the maximum possible number of such links,
ci ¼ 2
P

is the average of such values, c ¼

The degree correlation between adjacent nodes is an
excellent measure for detecting structural ordering in the net-
work. Here for simplicity, it suffices to considering the average
degree of nearest neighbors of a node, k

where Vi stands for the set of neighbors of i-th node. The aver-
age of these values is a good approximation for the adjacent

An interesting regularity in the form of power law with a
certain scaling exponent, a, exists between number of nodes,
Nb, and links, Lb, in the co-occurrence networks of the author’s
books. This is another network’s property that may be attrib-
uted to an author, Lb  Nab , b runs over the author’s books.

In our experiment the first step is to compute the network
measures for all books in the collection. Then, the average
value of the measures are computed over all books of any
author. These average measures characterize the writing style
of authors. Table I reports the results for the authors of our
collection. In this experiment, we use collection of the one
hundred and one books which are written by the nine famous
authors in English.
In the second step we compute the similarity value, pa(x),
which determines how much is likely that a book in our col-
lection, x, is written by a given author, a. Especially, how the
writing style of a book is similar to the set of books that are
written by particular author? It is carried out by bringing out a
book from set of the author’s books, if it exists within, then
recalculating again the averaged measures for his other books.
To calculate the probability of writing a book by specific
author according to the particular measure. It is sufficient to
compute the network measure of the book and compare it
with the average of the same measure for the books of author

The indices m and a are used for displaying the measure and

There is no rational reason for the existence of correlation
between measures of a book. Our experience also confirms
this assumption. Accordingly, we can calculate the similarity

pairs in our experiment. The results are reported in nine
tables in the Appendix.
The predictability power of authorship identification
methods can be measured by the accuracy. The accuracy is

where TP stands for the number of books that truly attributed
to the right author and TN shows the number of books truly
not attributed to the wrong author. In our experiment, we
correctly identify fifty nine book-author pairs, TP¼ 59 and
exclude truly seven hundred sixty six pairs, TN¼ 766. The
accuracy in our experiment is more than 90 percent.
III. METRICS FOR COMPARISON OF WRITING STYLES
In this section, we try to answer the important question.
Which author has its own style such that he could be identified
through his writings? Whether he follows his style? We will
go further and try to quantify the writing styles. Albeit, it does
not mean that we evaluate the styles from the literary point of
view. In the following some metrics are introduced in this
regard. It is important to note, all metrics are evaluated from
the similarity values which are reported in nine tables in the
Appendix.
Metric 1: Among the set of books of a given author, how
many books are correctly attributed to him? In the context of
information retrieval, this fraction is called the precision of
the identification process. The precision value is first metric
that is assigned to an author. Each table in the Appendix con-
tains the similarity values that are computed for the set of
books of an author. In the column that is recognized by the
name of the right author, we can count the number of truly
identification (bold cases). The precision is obtained by divid-
ing this number to the total number of the author’s books. For
example, Table IV contains information about the author
attribution for Darwin’s books. If you see the second column
you will find the number of times that our method has identi-
fied Darwin as the right author (the bold values). There is nine
correct predictions among twelve cases. Thus, 0.75 is the met-
ric value for Darwin.
The precision metric presents a simple information
about the authors and some other matters are omitted. For
example, the precision does not inform us about the number
of falsely attributed books? Any row in the author identifica-
tion table is dedicated to the similarity values for one of his
books, what is the rank of the right author in this row? These
issues are discussed in the following.
It is worth to note that the precision is completely de-
pendent on the collection, adding the works of new author or
deleting the existing one, may change its value.
Metric 2: If we list the authors according to their similar-
ity values for a given book in descending order from the most
to the least, it is a rational question to ask about the place of
right author in the list. We should distinguish between standing
at the top or being in the bottom of the list. Concerning to this
issue, we can obtain the rank of author for all of his books and
introduce its average rank as an important attribute. The aver-
age rank is a value greater than one, it is better to use its
inverse as the second metric. Hence, the second metric changes
in the range between zero and one, such as the first metric. The
average rank metric is also dependent on the collection.
As an example, we can look again at Table IV. Each row
is dedicated to present the results of author identification for
the particular book of Darwin. For each book, we can sort the
authors according to their similarity values from the most to
the least. We rightly distinguish Darwin as the author of the
nine books among twelve ones. Then, for these books Darwin
places in the first rank. Three other books are, Expression of
Emotion in Man and Animals, Formation of Vegetable Mould
and The Movements and Habits of Climbing Plants where
Darwin stands at second, seventh, and fourth places in the list
of authors, respectively. Sum of these ranks for Darwin is
equal to 22. His average rank is approximately equal to 1.83,
then the second metric for Darwin is calculated by inverting
this value, 0.55.
Metric 3: The precision or the average rank cannot
completely account the writing style of an author. It is

important to know how much is the probability (similar
value) for attribution of a book to its right author, whether
this identification has the highest score or not. The average
of such probabilities over the books of an author is also a
good metric for evaluation of his writing style. Third metric
is also a value between zero and one. To evaluate this metric
for Darwin, we average the similarity values in the second
column of Table IV which approximately results 0.66.
Unlike the previous two metrics, this metric is independ-
ent of any knowledge about the other authors.
We calculate these metric for all authors in our experi-
ment. The results are reported in Table II. We also illustrate
the results graphically in Fig. 1. The author with greater met-
ric value is more identifiable than others through his writ-
ings. We have no rational reason to adopt a metric or
combination of metrics against others for evaluation of the
writing styles. For assessment the utility of these metrics, lit-
erates and experts must provide data for the style evaluation
of the authors manually by various purposes, then comparing
the results with those are reported here and finding the best
metric for any specific literary purpose.
In our experiment, if we sort the authors according to any
metric from the most to the least values, Shakespeare acquires
the first place. Consequently we can conclude, Shakespeare is
the best by any metric which has been introduced here.
In our experiment, we find that the first metric can dis-
tinguishes between different genres. However, such matter
should be studied in a richer collection, more accurately.
Using data set for the author identification probabilities
where are exhibited in Appendix, several other metrics may
be defined for particular purposes. Here, we only try to show
the existence of such possibility based on the complex net-
work theory, increasing the precision of the method remains
for the future works.
IV. CONCLUSION
In this work, we briefly reviewed our recent work for
the author attribution, using the complex network theory,
but for a collection of English books. The results reported
in several tables in Appendix. We also introduced three
metrics for stylometry of the authors. The writing styles of
the authors were quantified and allowed us to compare
them. Concerning to these metrics, Shakespeare appeared
as high stylistic author whom could be identified precisely
through his books.
