Abstract 
The digitization of several million books by Google in 2011 meant the popularization of a 
new kind of humanities research powered by the treatment of cultural objects as data. 
Culturomics, as it is called, was born, and other initiatives resonated with such a 
methodological approach, as is the case with the recently formed Digital Humanities or 
Cultural Analytics. Intrinsically, these new quantitative approaches to culture all borrow 
from techniques and methods developed under the wing of the exact sciences, such as 
computer science, machine learning or statistics. There are numerous examples of studies 
that take advantage of the possibilities that treating objects as data has to offer for the 
understanding of the human. This new data science that is now applied to the current 
trends in culture can also be replicated to study more traditional humanities. Led by 
proper intellectual inquiry, an adequate use of technology may bring answers to questions 
intractable by other means, or add evidence to long held assumptions based on a canon 
built from few examples. This dissertation argues in favor of such approach. Three 
different case studies are considered. First, in the more general sense of the big and smart 
data, we collected and analyzed more than 120,000 pictures of paintings from all periods 
of art history, to gain a clear insight on how the beauty of depicted faces, in the 
framework of neuroscience and evolutionary theory, has changed over time. A second 
study covers the nuances of modes of emotions employed by the Spanish Golden Age 
playwright Calderón de la Barca to empathize with his audience. By means of sentiment 
analysis, a technique strongly supported by machine learning, we shed some light into the 
different fictional characters, and how they interact and convey messages otherwise 
invisible to the public. The last case is a study of non-traditional authorship attribution 
techniques applied to the forefather of the modern novel, the Lazarillo de Tormes. In the 
end, we conclude that the successful application of cultural analytics and computer 
science techniques to traditional humanistic endeavours has been enriching and 
validating.

Acknowledgments 
I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my supervisor, Prof. Juan Luis Suárez, for 
his accessibility in every step of the research, exceptional support and guidance 
throughout my study period and transition from a somewhat square state of mind, result 
of a formal training in the hard sciences and outside work in the industry of software 
engineering, to a reasonable self-reflexive new self, which has outgrown and improved 
me in many personal and career aspects of my life. Prof. Suárez has motivated me to 
continue to strive for excellence particularly during the most challenging times, while 
providing a reality check of the trade-offs we all must assume at any point of a career. 
My colleagues, the faculty, and staff from the Department of Modern Languages and 
Literature, for fostering a kind of critical thinking that I was lacking, for making me 
realize the importance of knowing how the world has worked and how it currently works 
beyond the sciences, and for the discovery of how brilliant people can be, no matter their 
field of study. 
I would also like to thank my colleagues at the CulturePlex Lab, past and present: María, 
Miriam, Camelia, Shiddarta, Roberto, Diego and Élika. And the ones who I have shared 
most of my time and space with: Adriana, Antonio, Ben, David, Nandita, and Natalia. 
Thanks for making everyday a pleasure to go to work, for sharing your lives and 
circumstances with me, and for teaching me so much inglish. It has been a long trip, but I 
am happy to see they are not only excellent researchers and persons, but possibly friends 
for life. Josema, Gabi, and Fernando, with whom I have shared many virtual meetings, 
have also been extremely patient and understanding in both my excuses and changes of 
mood. 
My distant family: my father, my brothers Fernando, and Raúl, my sister Mirian, and my 
awesome nephew –who refers to me as “Uncle Javi from Canada”–, who have provided 
me with their unconditional love and heartwarming support at all times, regardless of 
whether or not they understood what was that I was doing or even why. This work is 
dedicated to them. And to my mom, la más Bort, who although sadly and hurtfully long 
vii 
 
gone, is still present in all my life successes and endeavours, and made me the person I 
am, with her pleasant and serene wisdom that only a great person can have, and who 
always supported every crazy and adventurous idea I had, even when that meant space 
and distance between us. 
My friends, mostly overseas, have offered their smiles, inside jokes, free nostalgia, words 
of encouragement, and good vibes in that of life always finds its way, and achievements 
and sharing them, are as important as enjoying the path while maintaining close those 
who we love. Their contribution has touched my heart and motivated me during the most 
difficult times. 
And to the love of my life, Esperanza, who, at the risk of sounding cliché, has provided 
me with the kind of unconditional, uninterested, and encouraging support that only she 
can and knows how to offer, despite of the good and bad times, through the good and bad 
times. And to the tiresome and simpleton dog, Nilo, who at times has forced me to go 
outside against my will, which almost always has been of help. 
In summary, my way on this dissertation has made me a more honest, humble, and 
critical person, and for that I am grateful. 
Through my collaboration at the CulturePlex Lab and the Hispanic Baroque Project, this 
research was generously supported by SSHRC and CFI.

Chapter 1  
1 Introduction 
In the late 1940’s Roberto Busa initiated the collection and digitization of all works of 
Saint Thomas Aquinas. His Index Thomisticus (Busa, “Index”) needed the investment of 
almost 30 years in order to be considered complete, and it is probably the first example of 
synergy between the humanities and computer science. In retrospect, we owe the 
existence of the computational humanities to a project privately sponsored by IBM and 
its founder himself, Thomas J. Watson (Busa, “Annals” 83-90). In a time when 
computers were huge mainframes conceived to ingest and process data for governments, 
big companies, and research in the STEM disciplines (science, technology, engineering, 
and mathematics), the achievement of Father Busa ushered in a new and unexplored 
world of possibilities for humanists. Despite the criticism that accompanied –and still 
does– this new methodology (see e.g., Kirsch), over the next decades the mixing of 
technology with traditional scholarship would develop silently and in parallel with the 
advances in computing. The appearance of affordable personal computers and their 
popularization in homes fostered the notion of the machine as a universal computing 
center. Day-to-day activities started to be replaced or carried out by computers, and more 
digitized resources began to be a necessity in the humanities for both their study and 
preservation. The explosion in the communications that the Internet and smartphones 
brought about, led humanities scholars to demand their own customized pieces of 
software. Databases and encyclopedias of all kinds were developed, initiatives and 
standardization efforts such as the “Poughkeepsie Principles” –which would later become 
the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)– were founded, and associations and journals were 
created to accommodate the increasing number of scholarly publications related to the 
computing humanities.1 A dimension Father Busa could have hardly imagined when he 
started his digitization enterprise, and for which traditional non-computerized scholars

Siemens, and Unsworth.

were not yet ready, as the treating of the “machine’s efficiency as a servant” rather than 
“its participant enabling of criticism” evidences (McCarty). 
The past decade witnessed the rebranding and unification of all humanities and 
technology efforts under the now ubiquitous Digital Humanities brand (usually 
capitalized), or simply DH.2 According to Kirschenbaum, the term was coined by John 
Usworth as a way to “shift the emphasis away from simple digitization” (5), and in doing 
so, Father Busa’s approach was left behind. It is becoming common practice in digital 
humanities research to employ a large range of software applications in the 
methodologies. Their practitioners, having previously utilized computer scientists and 
programmers as disposable labour in projects as a support service for the “real” 
humanists (Hayles 42-66) –instead of forming truly multidisciplinary teams–, are now 
exhausting all that can be done in the field by means of on-demand software.3 It is still 
easy to identify evidence of this in recent conferences, where some of the tools that were 
presented did not really contribute to any specific research question or intellectual 
inquiry, beyond that of the mere software engineering prospect (Scheinfeldt 56-60). 
Possibly led by a lack of solid formulation, this situation forced the update of the recently 
created discipline to a newer version. In the words of one of the authors of the second 
manifesto, “Digital Humanities 2.0 introduces entirely new disciplinary paradigms, 
convergent fields, hybrid methodologies, and even new publication models that are often 
not derived from or limited to print culture” (Presner 6). Thus, an attempt to address one 
of the often adduced problems of digital humanities: its lack of a critical apparatus. The 
criticism of the so-called computational turn is usually based on the postmodern 
condition of the metanarrative of science as argued by Lyotard (see e.g., Hall 781-809). 
Faced with the impossibility of reconciling disciplines such as the humanities and the 
sciences, any justification for them in the form of a narrative is inherently unjust. This 
                                                 
2 The foundation of the Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations (ADHO), the creation of the National 
Endowment for the Humanities (NEH), and the Modern Language Association (MLA) 2009 meeting, were 
all key in the popularization and settlement of digital humanities.

out a study in relation to digital art history. Her presentation is available at

disapproval has many forms and shapes, from cultural studies to art history, but it has 
been in literary criticism and textual analysis where it got more ferocious. In his infamous 
piece Literature Is Not Data: Against Digital Humanities, Stephen Marche alludes to the 
humanness in literature, leaving to the reader the suggestion of the inhumanness of data, 
conceived as the concretization of the object of study in the digital form (Schöch 2-13). 
He goes as far as putting algorithms at the level of fascism “because they give the 
comforting illusion of an alterity to human affairs.” In his opinion, analyzing a novel by 
computational means, regardless of the goal, is at the “limit of reductivism [and] removes 
all the refinement from criticism.” Others are a little more restrained in their defense of 
the traditional, and after pointing out the limitations of the computational turn, instead of 
highlighting its strengths (Ramsay 482), defend that computational approaches demand a 
new algorithmic critic, rather than regular literary critics judging a methodological effort 
by its lack of hermeneutics (491). 
The main error that digital humanists fall into, according to Ramsay, is to “mistake 
questions about the properties of objects with questions about the phenomenal experience 
of observers,” two positions that are irreconcilable (483). Detractors of the computational 
approach usually operate under the assumption that the use of computers in the realms of 
the humanities is by default imposing the interpretative framework of science, accepting 
a sole and unique meaning of fact and evidence for the hermeneutical reading of the 
results. This might be a necessity for literary criticism, where a single concept of truth 
does not apply and the interpretation of the facts is usually, and constantly, called into 
question. However, artefacts such as algorithms, statistical measures, or computer 
programs that are employed by digital humanists must be validated within their own field 
of knowledge to be legitimized and used without falling into a methodological aberration. 
In a sense, digital humanists accept the axiomatic nature of computers and mathematics, 
while taking advantage of all they can do to approach inquiries that may otherwise be 
unfathomable. 
This is especially important when the magnitude and scale of the object of study 
surpasses any existing theoretical framework. If a discipline still does not have the tools 
to deal with millions of books, pointing out at why that might not be of interest is one 
4 
 
 
position, tackling the problem by borrowing from others who had similar issues is what 
the computational turn enables (Borgman). In this context, Lev Manovich proposed his 
Cultural Analytics as a combined mixture of quantitative methodologies, and deep and 
critically constructed analysis: the result of marrying “expertise in computer science, 
statistics, and data mining” to rigorous theoretical critique and self-reflexivity (“How to 
Follow” 6; “Debates”). In doing so, Manovich aims for the creation of tools “to enable 
new type [sic] of cultural criticism and analysis appropriate for the era of cultural 
globalization and user-generated media” (“How to Follow” 21; “Cultural Analytics”). 
Although Manovich tries to avoid limiting the scope of his cultural analytics, it is usually 
applied to new media and contemporary objects of study. A very closely related concept 
is what Franco Moretti called “distant reading” (“Graphs”; “Distant reading”). At the 
same time, the appearance of studies such as Culturomics, the Historical Index of 
Popularity, the Framework for Cultural History, and Cultural Networks, are all applying 
such ideas in their respective fields (Suárez, McArthur, and Soto-Corominas 45-50; 
Schich et al. 558-562; Yu et al.; Michel et al. 176-182).4 They all concern a humanistic 
inquiry and resonate with the ideas of digital humanities and cultural analytics. In that 
sense, this is what this dissertation tries to accomplish. 
One field that has skyrocketed in recent years inside the computer science is artificial 
intelligence, and more specifically, an algorithmic approach known as machine learning. 
Fed by what is called big data,5 the mathematical models used in machine learning are 
able to learn from previous examples (training) and make predictions about unseen data 
in a supervised learning fashion. Even with unlabeled samples, the models are still 
                                                 
4 Citing from Suárez, McArthur, and Soto-Corominas, “Schich et al. also focus on individuals in order to 
develop a data-driven macroscopic perspective, in which the study of statistical regularities is combined 
with the impact of the local deviations that are found in those general patterns,” “Yu et al., for example, 
approach the study of the geniuses of human culture production [...] across linguistic and cultural 
boundaries [...] measuring what figures are more recognized across these boundaries,” and “[t]he main 
characteristics of Michel et al.’s work are the study of text found in books, the fact that their applications of 
Culturomics techniques are focused on the past, and the lack of social contextualization provided by the 
study [...] Granularity, size of information, as well as time and linguistic extension are combined in order to 
reach a scale that is unprecedented in our approach to human history and culture.” 
5 Succinctly, data that is produced fast (velocity), in gigantic amounts (volume), and in different formats 
(variety) (Beyer and Laney). In digital humanities we understand as data any artefact that can be stored and 
manipulated by digital means, e.g., pictures of paintings, digital recordings, or digitized text (Borgman).

capable of estimating groupings among them through unsupervised learning. Recent 
claims have supported a stronger joint venture between humanities and data science 
(Manovich), although not all voices are in favour (Pinker; Konnikova). The rest of this 
dissertation highlights three different case studies in DH that also benefited from a deep 
understanding of the sciences involved, and that show the advantages and limitations of 
such approaches. If there is one direction that has marked this endeavour, it has been that 
certain methods and tools were created and/or adapted to respond to assumptions that 
question our understanding of the human condition as has been reflected in art and 
literature. 
1.1 Beauty 
Recently, Manovich dedicated a whole (invited) article in the newly created Journal for 
Digital Art History to explain the hidden details of data science and why it is important in 
the context of art history in particular and cultural analytics in general (“Science of 
Culture”). His foundational article on cultural analytics starts by asking some questions 
about culture and the possibilities of a quantitative, rather than computational, approach. 
Specifically, he asks about the possible ways in which we could “visually represent how 
cultural and lifestyle preferences –whether for music, forms, designs, or products– 
gradually change over time” (“Cultural Analytics” 1). In other studies, he insists that 
cultural analytics as an umbrella term is wide enough to account for the study of both 
“historical artifacts created by professionals” as well as “vernacular” contemporary 
creations that fall out of the traditional subjects of humanities. 
In this sense, our first study consisted of an exploration of said trend when applied to art 
history, using images of paintings rather than texts. We were interested in the evolution 
of perceived attractiveness of faces in world painting as defined by today’s standards. 
After collecting a set of 120,000 paintings from different periods (which was a challenge 
in itself), we analyzed the depicted human faces between the 13th and the 20th centuries. 
Our goal was to establish whether there was a single canon of beauty or whether this has 
changed over time.

We resorted to averageness and symmetry in the faces as proxies for their perceived 
attractiveness. Both concepts, borrowed from neuroscience, have an adequate definition 
tenable under evolution theory. On the other hand, machine learning methods for face 
identification were used as a base to build our indices of symmetry and averageness 
upon. Points detected by the computer vision algorithm were included in the calculation 
of such indices, which gave us a tool to analyze a large collection of paintings otherwise 
intractable. 
Our study showed that when measuring averageness and symmetry, the representation of 
human faces has not remained constant and that there are substantial differences between 
the faces depicted between the 15th and 18th centuries when compared to those of both 
the 13th and 20th centuries. Especially significant is the decrease in the perceived beauty 
of faces in 20th-century paintings, as the freedom of artists and the openness of society 
fostered the representation of different types of human faces other than that of classical 
styles.

1.2 Emotions 
Google’s project of digitizing millions of books, and the “distant reading” approach that 
it makes possible, seemed to bother Stephen Marche. The Canadian writer did not seem 
to understand that these new approaches are changing and challenging our very own 
conception of culture and how we approach its study in the digital age. In DH, the term 
project is usually preferred to study, we believe, due to its involvement of 
multidisciplinary knowledge; these projects are creatively coming up with new ways to 
address literary-historical questions that could not be easily addressed without computers. 
In our second study, we focused on the role of sentiments in the creation of the fictional 
characters of Spanish playwright Calderón de la Barca’s autos sacramentales (dramatic 
plays of allegorical nature). This would help us understand how baroque theatre created 
massive successful performances for many decades precisely by appealing to sentiments 
and opinions that the audience may have shared. We tracked down the extent of the 
presence of emotions in the autos with the help of a massive and, at the same time, 
detailed study of the sentiments expressed by the characters that Calderón created. 
Furthermore, we delved into the distribution of these emotions by studying the 
occurrence of positive and negative sentiments among different typologies of characters, 
so that we could offer a more nuanced view of the psychology of these characters, even 
when they were of allegorical nature. 
In recent years, brands have developed an interest in knowing how the public perceives 
them and their products. Early works by Turney and Pang set the foundation for the 
analysis of sentiments expressed in texts by means of supervised learning (Pang, Lee, and 
Vaithyanathan 79-86; Turney 417-424). From a corpus of products and movie reviews, 
they built a binary classifier –a model that assigns one of two categories– in order to 
estimate the polarity expressed: whether they were positive or negative reviews towards 
the object being reviewed. Their corpus and model have been used ever since to assess 
the sentiment in texts of different kinds that have little or nothing to do with consumer 
reviews. Although their methodology was applicable to our study, we were forced to 
build our own annotated corpus that would let us create a domain-specific classifier for 
two main reasons. Firstly, there is a clear difference in complexity between product 
8 
 
 
reviews and 17th-century Spanish Golden Age theatre. Secondly, there is a lack of 
annotated corpora available for sentiment analysis of theatre of this period. Creating our 
own annotated corpus allowed us to effectively apply Turney and Pang’s methodology to 
better typify characters in Calderón’s plays. This allowed us to see that it is hard to 
decide whether Calderón was using the characters’ speeches to send clear religious 
messages or just as devices to fool his audience and play with the public. 
1.3 Authorship 
The analysis of texts sits at the core of humanities and DH itself. Identifying writing 
styles and authors of anonymous or wrongly attributed texts has been of interest to 
scholars at least since the invention of the printing press, when the availability of texts 
fostered comparative studies.6 The introduction of computers made it easier and 
affordable to analyze internal characteristics of texts and whole corpora. The successful 
attribution of the essays in The Federalist marked the start of modern authorship 
techniques powered by computers (Mosteller and Wallace). Mostly focused in English 
texts since its beginning, language-independent methods of attribution have later 
appeared as part of computational linguistics (Peng et al. 267-274).

for legend codes. 
We embarked in the difficult task of finding –or getting close to– the true author of what 
is considered the first modern novel, the Spanish Lazarillo de Tormes. Unlike closed-set 
attribution problems where the authors involved are known and the only task remaining is 
to identify who wrote what, Lazarillo turned out to be an open-set problem, where new 
authors are still being added to the pool of candidates. Digitization of original Spanish 
Golden Age manuscripts also presented some challenges, as modern editions of most 
authors’ works were missing. We solved the problem by building and using a 
crowdsourcing OCR reviewing tool which streamlined the process.7

dimensionality reduction (t-SNE). 
In terms of the attribution itself, and building upon the latest research in the field, our 
final approach was comprised of three steps: first, we used unsupervised learning with 
features of different nature to reduce the pool of candidates.8 Then, applying supervised 
learning, we ranked possible authors. Finally, only six of these candidates were fed into 
an ensemble algorithm for “unmasking” the most likely author. Ensemble methods are, 
basically, combinations of simpler classifiers, as that is the name that supervised learning 
models receive. Computational authorship attribution endeavours always entail concerns 
about confidence, yet we found that by making the machine able to recognize different 
writing styles present in Lazarillo we could shed some light into a centuries old problem. 
At the same time, we contributed with our own algorithms and corpora.

2 A Quantitative Approach to Beauty. Perceived 
Attractiveness of Human Faces in World Painting 
Has human beauty always been perceived in the same manner? We used a set of 120,000 
paintings from different periods to analyze depicted human faces between the 13th and 
the 20th centuries in order to establish whether there has been a single canon of beauty or 
whether this has changed over time. 
2.1 Introduction 
The voters who participated in the “2012 Britain’s Most Beautiful Face” competition 
agreed on considering that Florence Colgate’s face was the most beautiful one and named 
her the winner among 8,000 entries (Kindelan). It turns out that the distance between her 
eyes and mouth is a 32% of her face, almost the exact third that Greeks considered to be 
the perfect proportion of a beautiful face. The results of this contest emphasized the long-
standing human effort to scientifically estimate the features of beauty and to establish a 
method that allows for a reliable measurement of that which makes a face attractive. 
The relation between the proportions of the human face and its perceived attractiveness 
have always captured attention and produced enormous fascination among scientists and 
artists alike. Even newborns seem to dedicate more time to attractive faces than to others 
(Grammer, Karl, and Thornhill, 223). How these proportions are meant to be the 
guidelines that define facial beauty has been the object of philosophic and scientific 
considerations since Plato’s time. However, binary approaches to beauty, such as 
Hogarth’s serpentine line (Hogarth), the Vitruvius’ “well-shaped man” (Rowland, Ingrid, 
and Howe), divina proportione, the golden ratio, or Fibonacci, have proven inconclusive 
to explain how beauty is actually perceived (Etcoff, “Survival”). As it has been 
considered that the expression of a face is the sum of a multitude of small details 
(Galton), we can also say that the attractiveness of a face is the sum of a varied set of 
distinct features. The latest investigations on evolutionary psychology and neuro-
aesthetics point at similar conclusions. Beauty of unknown faces seems to include 
elements from averageness, symmetry, sexual dimorphism, pleasant expressions, and 
12 
 
 
youthfulness.9 While the existence of universal beauty standards should be explained in 
terms of an adaptionist approach to attractiveness, these standards should vary across 
cultures if they are the result of aesthetic judgments or culturally dependent values 
(Abramson and Pinkerton; Buss, 1-14; Cunninghan et al., 261-279; Jones, and Hill, 271-
296; Berry, 273-342). 
The goal of setting the exact measurements that would help us establish the degree of 
beauty of a face suggests that these measures, and the beauty implicit in them, respond to 
the existence of a stereotype of physical attractiveness and that this stereotype might have 
remained constant throughout human history, even if it is a byproduct of the perceptual 
system’s design and not the result of evolved psychological adaptations (Fink, and 
Penton-Voak, 154-158; Dion, Berscheid, and Walster, 285). That is, a face that was 
considered beautiful during the Renaissance would have also been attractive in the 
Baroque, Neoclassical or Modernist periods. And the reverse would also be true: faces 
that are considered beautiful today such as those of Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie, or Johnny 
Depp would have been among the most attractive faces in centuries past. These would be 
timeless beauties. But, is this really the case? Can we infer that the astonishing 
resemblance of Scarlett Johansson to the woman depicted in Vermeer’s Girl with a Pearl 
Earring is due to the existence of a constant canon of beauty in human history? 
Given the abundance of data required to carry out a study that comprises as many periods 
and genres of art history as possible, we decided to take the concept of beauty in a 
measurable and comparable way. We are aware that an objective definition of beauty 
might not necessarily correlate with the ideals of the artists and, therefore, the assumption 
that artists intend to represent beauty might be theoretically disputable. We do not make 
such an assumption. We try to establish to what extend the result of artists’ practices 
converges or deviates from numerically measurable standards of beauty as understood by 
the scientific discourse. Because of methodological reasons, in our study, the focus is 
placed on the current standards of beauty as defined by scientific methodology in terms 
of face symmetry and averageness. These two indices seem to be related to the perception 
                                                 
9 See the foundational works by Thornhill, and Gangestad (“Facial attractiveness” 452-460), Nigel (395-
424), Douglas, and Shepard (321-322), and Perrett et al. (884-887).

of beauty: symmetrical faces are the result of a non-problematic development after 
puberty, and therefore guarantee a better offspring (Rhodes, and Zebrowitz, 1). 
Averageness, on the other hand, operates by the evolutionary pressure of Darwin’s theory 
of natural selection: subjects with features close to the mean for a population are 
preferred to others, as the probability of them having harmful mutations is lower 
(Langlois, and Roggman, “Attractive” 115-121). Therefore, there is enough evidence to 
support the idea that both symmetry and averageness play a role in the perception of 
beauty: the more average and symmetrical, the more beautiful a face is usually ranked. A 
perfect combination of the external criterion –relation to the average face of a period– 
and the internal criterion –symmetry of features– would result in the most attractive face, 
turning a subjective opinion such as what face is beautiful into something measurable and 
objective. 
Coming up with the right set of faces in order to determine levels of beauty in various 
historical periods, was not a straightforward path. Nowadays, it is becoming less difficult 
to perform studies on faces thanks to the overflow of photographs that we come across on 
any given day. The combination of digital technologies, ubiquity of cell phones and 
cameras, and widespread distribution of information through social networks make it 
relatively easy to get ahold of large data sets of faces on which to perform beauty analysis 
and validation.10 However, before the official birth of practical photography in 1839 and 
its subsequent popularization in the 20th century, the only historical record available of 
human images was that of art history. Drawings and paintings have always been prone to 
representations of human figures. Both in the portraiture genre and as part of more 
diverse compositions, human faces can be found in numerous works of art of most styles 
and historical periods. The question is how to use the faces represented in paintings such 
as Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci, Self-Portrait Without Beard by Vincent van Gogh, 
or The Night Watch by Rembrandt as the subject of the type of analysis required to isolate 
features, measure distances, or determine metrics of averageness in a set of faces.

2.2 Materials and Methods 
Surprisingly, the most extensive source of paintings, as well as the easiest to work with, 
came from a private collection of digital images curated for years and made available on-
line for free.11 Every painting has at least information about title, size, author, and date. 
However, accurate dates are only provided for paintings in the past two centuries –before 
the 1800s, the dataset only has the century in which the painting was produced (although 
some open collections have appeared more recently).12 For this reason, we treated all 
paintings equally and decided to use the century information as the basic unit of time for 
this study. On the other hand, the resolution of the images of the paintings was not very 
important since face detection algorithms usually work by scaling high resolution images 
down. For the algorithm we used, images bigger than 1024px of height or width were 
resized before being processed.13 We used a Python script to download the meta-data for 
each image, perform the requests to the face recognition API, and collect, clean and 
organize the results.14 The algorithms for calculating symmetry and averageness indices 
were also written in Python, following the formulas detailed below. 
Besides the calculation of the boundaries of a face and the position of several facial traits 
–such as eyes, nose, mouth, ears, or chin–, the algorithm we used also made guesses 
about the gender and age of the depicted faces, basing its estimations on the distribution 
and proportions of the traits and providing a threshold of confidence. Calculation of 
symmetry is commonly based on an early work of Grammer and Thornhill (“Homo 
sapiens”). Their method makes use of 12 different points (one more for averageness): 2 
for each eye, 2 for the nose, 2 for the mouth, 2 for the cheekbones, and the last 2 for the 
jaw. With these points, they create lines for each pair and calculate their midpoints. In a 
perfectly symmetrical face, all midpoints must lie on the same vertical line. For our

study, the algorithm used is significantly more limited compared to that, with 3 points for 
the mouth (left, center, and right), 1 for each pupil, and 1 for the nose. We could have 
considered ears or chin, but the number of faces in which these attributes were found with 
enough confidence (higher than 80%) is fairly insignificant (6%). Therefore, our method 
to calculate the symmetry of a face differs slightly from the one proposed by Grammer 
and Thornhill, while the main idea remains unchanged. Besides the points cited 
previously, the algorithm also gives us the centroid or geometric center of all detected 
features (Fig. 1A), which is supposed to coincide with the center of the face. From it, we 
can set a straight line that splits the face into two sides or hemi-faces. Figure 1B shows 
points 1 to 6 (P1 for left eye, P2 for right eye, P3 for nose, P4 for mouth center, P5 for 
left mouth corner, and P6 for right mouth corner), as well as the line H, that we assume to 
be the axis of face symmetry. We now trace segments: D1 between P1 and P2, and D2 
between P5 and P6 (Fig. 1C). For these segments we calculate the midpoints M1 and M2. 
Symmetry is now obtained as the sum of the distances in pixels of M1, M2, P3 and P6 
with respect to the line H. Only lateral symmetry is therefore estimated. For perfect 
symmetrical faces this value adds to zero; all symmetry values are normalized between 0 
and 1, and we inverted the meaning to make plots clearer, where 1 means perfect 
symmetry, and 0 total asymmetry. 
16 
 
 
Let be (centerx, centery) the point that defines the center of a face, and roll the rotation 
angle as returned by the algorithm, being 0° a perpendicular face with respect to the 
baseline of the frame of the painting. Then, we define the symmetry of face, Sym,15 as 
follows:

On the other hand, the obtaining of averageness values involves a task much more 
demanding in terms of computer power. For each century an average face has been 
computer-generated for male, female and both (Fig. 2). In order to produce this averaged 
composite face, we first centered the faces according to the center point given by the face 
recognition algorithm. Faces were then resized to make them fit into a PNG canvas of 
500 by 500 pixels at 300dpi of resolution, and given a height of 200 pixels; faces with 
height lower than 150 pixels were excluded to avoid blurred pixelation of the average 
face. This process was achieved by using affine and projective 2D transformations from 
the original painting to the desired canvas. Every face standardized by size was then 
converted into a 3D numerical matrix representing each of the layers of the RGB color 
model. A regular statistical mean was then calculated over the set of faces of each century 
in order to obtain the average value for each pixel. Once the average matrix was 
calculated, it was converted back into a PNG image. The resulting quality and 
averageness of the composite relied on the number of faces used in each century for 
generating the averaged face. The same face recognition algorithm used in the dataset 
was then applied on averaged composites. This allowed us to measure the averageness of 
an individual face as the difference between its symmetry and the symmetry of the 
average face for that particular period. 
Let be F the set of k faces of a specific period of time, in our case, a century. Then we 
calculate the average composite as follows:

Averageness refers to the degree to which a given face resembles the majority of faces. In 
our study averageness values go from the most average, 1, to the least, 0. Figure 3, A and 
B, shows the histogram and the density estimation for the distributions of both symmetry 
and averageness values, respectively. 
A considerable amount of paintings and faces were needed to draw valid conclusions 
about trends in human representation and facial attractiveness across historical periods. 
We retrieved and analyzed a data set with over 120,000 digital images of paintings 
covering styles and artistic periods spanning from the 13th to the 20th century. We

tuple of three images, starting from the rightmost side, represents the average composite 
of a given century for female, both genders, and male faces, respectively. These images 
were generated in order to calculate the values of averageness per century for each face.

applied face recognition algorithms to these images to remove all paintings that had no 
recognizable faces in them, to end up with 25,000 paintings and over 47,000 human 
faces. For the current study only 5,800 faces that fulfill the following criteria were 
considered: frontal faces no smaller than 150 pixels in height, with pitch and yaw angles 
between 20º and -20º with respect to the vertical line, and with valid information for at 
least the following traits: eyes, nose, mouth, height, width, and center of the face. Face 
rotation or roll was fixed geometrically. Once we had identified the traits of the detected 
faces, and based on meta-analysis of symmetry and averageness (Rhodes, 199-226), we 
were able to compare the beauty and attractiveness of faces in order to determine 
different trends and variations across time periods as they appeared in the history of 
painting. 
2.3 A Decline in Perceived Beauty 
Average values of symmetry per century are shown in figure 4A for male, female, and 
both genders combined. It can be noted that most symmetrical female faces were found in 
the 15th century, while most symmetrical male faces occurred in the 18th century. After 
that, both genders rapidly became much more asymmetrically represented in all styles 
during the 19th and 20th centuries. From the 15th to the 18th century, representations of 
human faces seem to have moved within a stripe of relatively constant symmetry with 
maximums of symmetry around 0.35 and minimums of 0.32. This stripe of constant 
symmetry conforms to what we call the classical representation of the human face, which 
is the product of two factors: first, a cultural conception that placed the highest aesthetic 
valuation on previous models of beauty, specifically in the Greek and Roman models 
recovered during the Renaissance, and made their imitation and reproduction the goals of 
the artist; second, a training system based on workshops and academies that fostered an 
education around skills and models that helped achieve the former goals (Morrison; 
Gebauer, and Wulf; Gouwens, 55–82; Weinberg; Kristeller). Variation within the 
classical mode can be attributed to the action-reaction effects that certain schools 
provoked against the previous dominant style, such as the separation from the ideal of 
symmetry proposed by Rococo artists versus more traditional styles such as Baroque and 
Neoclassicism (Gombrich, “The Story”).

Figure 2-4: Peak values of symmetry and averageness are found in the 15th and 18th 
centuries, decreasing slightly in between, but notably cresting in the extremes of the period 
(values of 1 indicate perfect symmetry, while 0 means total asymmetry). After the 18th 
century both values decrease equally until the 20th century, where we encounter the lowest 
average of symmetry and averageness of the last five centuries. Corresponding figures for 
specific painting styles for each century can be found in tables S1 to S5. (A) Average values 
of symmetry for the period between the 13th and 20th centuries, represented for male, 
female and both genders combined. (B) Average values of averageness for the same period 
for male and female compared to the corresponding composite and the composite of both 
genders. 
22 
 
 
The appearance of disruptive styles in painting starting in the 19th century, a trend that 
became more acute throughout the 20th century when movements such as Modernism, 
Avant-Garde, Impressionism, Surrealism, Cubism, and Pop-Art dominated the art scene, 
came with a radical distancing from the ideal of symmetry in the representation of the 
human face. Paintings like Picasso’s Les Demoisselles d’Avignon, Duchamp’s Nude 
Descending a Staircase, No. 2, or Pollock’s Male and Female responded to the new 
paradigms of human representation and to new approaches to beauty (Fig. 5).16 This 
ultimately led to a poor detection of such faces by the algorithm, and therefore it explains 
why the averaged faces for the 20th century are still close to the picture-perfect 
representation of a human face (Fig. 2). 
In the 20th century we also observe a considerable decrease (Fig. 6) in the ratio of faces 
detected in paintings as most of the aforementioned styles did not render realistic models 
of the human, rejected beauty, or simply tended to focus on concepts, dreams, or ideas in 
which the human being was not the central object (Steiner; Eco, and McEwen). This 
trend coincided with both the irruption of photography as the favorite medium to 
represent the human face and the movement of nonrepresentational art observed at the 
beginning of the same century and characterized as the “dehumanization of art” (Ortega y 
Gasset). 
A consequence of these differences in symmetry is reflected in the oscillations in 
averageness throughout art history. Figure 4B showed the distribution of averageness for 
male and female faces compared to their gender-specific averaged composite. In dashed 
lines we can also see the same distribution but with regards to the average face generated 
from both genders. A two-sample Kolmogorov–Smirnov test allows us to see that there is 
no significant difference between the two male distributions (p=0.92) and the two female 
ones (p=0.51).

Averageness, the difference between a face and the averaged composite face of each 
century, can shed light on how similar faces are to each other. For male faces, we observe 
that the levels of averageness are low in the 13th century, but then begin to increase until 
the 17th century, when averageness of faces gradually decreases until the minimums 
recorded in 20th-century painting styles. 
2.4 Culturomics of Art History 
Exact measurements such as averageness and symmetry help us better understand the 
various ways in which human faces have been depicted throughout the history of 
painting. However, as attested by art historians through traditional scholarship, these 
representations have not always remained constant, as different artistic styles have 
attempted their own ways of capturing facial beauty. After our analysis, we can conclude 
that there have been variations in the form in which facial beauty has been represented 
over time, and that these variations can be measured and tracked accurately. Of course, as 
in all data-based research endeavors, the better the dataset, the better the conclusions we 
can infer from our analysis. While there is a clear stripe conforming to features of 
classical representation of the human face from the 15th to the 18th centuries, both the 
Figure 2-6: Number of paintings and faces per century, and ratio (faces per painting) 
between both. 
25 
 
 
13th century –Gothic style– and contemporary art have shown clear deviations from the 
classical paradigm. Especially interesting is the data from 20th-century artistic styles, 
which shows low levels of both symmetry and averageness as well as a reduced 
proportion of total faces captured when compared with previous centuries.      
These results conform to the views of art historians regarding the aesthetic and 
methodological disruptions that occurred after the vanguards. There has arguably been a 
change in the concept of art itself as well as in the theories that explain and criticize it. It 
is nowadays accepted that the representation of the human does not necessarily attempt to 
represent beauty. This shift in thought is clear in the data analysis and opens the door to a 
second phase of the investigation. By contrasting the aesthetic theories of specific periods 
and artists against the data, we would be able to establish their levels of conformity to 
and deviation from the objective measures of beauty. This would allow us to complement 
the qualitative and conceptual analysis of art history with the study of quantitative data. 
Combining these two levels appropriately should be one of the methodological aims of 
any culturomics science. 
The separation from the classical mode of representing the human in contemporary art 
also serves as a reminder of the bias that we imposed on the analysis of perceived beauty 
by employing such accurate measuring systems. This bias also shows the interesting 
close relationship between classic ideas of beauty and art in Western cultures, and 
mathematical notions that support data-driven methods of research. While it is evident 
that the examples in Picasso’s, Duchamp’s, and Pollock’s works show deviations from 
painting styles which depict faces that conform better to measures of symmetry and 
averageness, the judgment of whether these human faces are more or less beautiful than 
previous cases remains as aesthetic one. The contingency of aesthetic values is subject to 
fads, trends, reactions, and public opinion (Dutton).  
Better algorithms can help us be more precise in the measurement of objective elements, 
although it has to be noted that the discipline that studies how social movements get 
started, become important and disappear, remains in its infancy (Pentland). Once we have 
improved the way to measure and analyze both the internal features of art works and the 
26 
 
 
dynamics of social movements that create judgments about those works, we will be able 
to approach these types of problems in a more accurate manner. 
Another relevant factor to take into account has to do with how representative the 
sampling used for this study is. While we are certain about the validity of the used set as 
related to art history, it is impossible to ascertain how representative these faces are of the 
real populations living in the various historical periods. However, we have observed that 
there is a correlation between the preservation –perhaps even the production– of various 
types of media and the size of the human population in various countries throughout time 
(Fig. 7, A and B). The more people, the more media is preserved (p=1.02e-05 for books). 
This correlation remains true for paintings (p=3.92e-04, see figure 7C).  
Although not explicitly discussed in this work, we have also verified that age, gender and 
face orientation, along with symmetry and averageness in the representation of human 
faces in paintings can become a complementary and objective way to identify and 
characterize styles and movements. Along with the exhaustive tagging for techniques, 
materials and the analysis and recording of chemical products used in art production, this 
could become the basis for the culturomics of art history (Michel et al., 176–182). 
Nevertheless, and although this does not contradict our findings, it is clear that there is 
also a variety of complex social, aesthetic and evolutionary elements that influence our 
judgment on beauty. Capturing these constructs into proper algorithms has not resulted 
yet in perfect solutions to account for changes in perceived beauty. As we have 
previously stated, this has to do in part with the close relation between classic ideas and 
mathematical models that biased the analysis towards certain ideas of beauty. It is also 
important to note that many of these variations are due to the pressure that culture exerts 
in the short term on the adoption of different traits, and the deviations that this provokes 
from well-established, long term genetic features related to beauty, reproduction, and 
social acceptance and belonging (Suárez, Sancho, and de la Rosa, 281-281). Thus, it is 
important that any approach to the culturomics of art history and beauty also takes into 
account cultural evolution and cultural history as forces that shape the results we find in 
the data, and that have to contribute to the explanation of those results.

3 It’s All a Sham! The Role of Emotions in the Characters 
of Calderón de la Barca’s Autos Sacramentales 
3.1 Introduction 
More than 60 years passed between Lope de Vega’s (1562-1635) hegemony as the most 
successful theatre play author and the rise in popularity of Calderón de la Barca 
(henceforth Calderón) (1600-1681) as the most celebrated and popular author of the 
second half of the 1630 decade (Arellano, “Historia” 139-140). During this period, 
emotions were the only constant element in the poetry and the literary production of all 
the authors that attained success. For the long time in which theatre was mainly 
considered a global spectacle and only later a publishable product (Arellano, “Historia” 
61), the theatre practice made increasingly more use of dramatic artefacts in order to 
build a sort of stack of dramatic techniques in which more recent methods would never 
cancel out the previous ones (Arellano, “Historia” 84). 
Although in its first phase theatre was especially dependant upon poetic text –keep in 
mind that this theatre is always written in verse (Sánchez Escribano and Porqueras)–, the 
construction of the Coliseo del Palacio del Buen Retiro (1634),17 as part of the cultural 
propaganda and support of the arts by the Conde-Duque de Olivares, meant the beginning 
of a new cycle that would be transferred to all theatre stages (Brown and Elliott). For the 
inauguration of the Coliseo del Retiro, Calderón composed the comedy El nuevo Palacio 
del Retiro (“The new Palace of el Retiro,” NP, 1634) and began to work with Italian 
scenographers Cosme Lotty and Baccio del Bianco in a collaborative process that would 
produce even more sophisticated works in terms of special effects, use of technology and 
elaborated scenography. Lotti and del Bianco were in fact engineers who had previously 
                                                 
17 Parque del Retiro is currently a park in the centre of Madrid but in the decade of 1630 it was one of the 
palaces in the outskirts of town where the king would spend most of his leisure time surrounded by the 
tamed nature, thanks to the work of engineers. The kings’ habitual residence was located in the Palacio de 
Alcázar (currently known as Palacio Real), which had originally been a Muslim fortress that burnt down in 
1734. 
42 
 
 
arrived to Madrid to take charge of different tasks related to ponds, gardens and theatres 
of royal palaces. 
The use of varied spaces in theatre constituted the second line of development of 
Calderón’s theatre of imagination (Suárez, “El Escenario”). Calderón exploits a concept 
of theatrical space and of theatre as a total show that stem from the notion of imaginary 
space. This conception has its source in the theatres of memory of Renaissance humanism 
–it is important to bear in mind that in some versions of the psychological theory of 
senses, imagination and memory overlap– and in the Jesuitical conception of imagination 
as the place of negotiation of affection. Calderón had studied in Colegio Imperial in 
Madrid, a school run by Jesuits, and therefore was well acquainted with both sources. A 
proof of this are the most theoretical reflections about art that Calderón puts in his 
characters’ mouths, in which theatre is conceived as a stage of imagination (Suárez, “El 
Escenario”). In this sense, imagination is the conduct that triggers the affection of the 
characters’ senses by means of the actor’s body and his voice (Rodríguez Cuadros): 
horror, admiration, news, marvels, and the linguistic effects of the conceptist rhetoric of 
baroque poetry. 
While this meta-theatrical conception manifests itself in all of the texts by Calderón, its 
practical implementation changes depending on the dramatic spaces. Spanish baroque 
authors initially worked in public theatres, which were known as corrales (“farmyards”) 
at the time –the most famous ones are in Madrid: el Corral del Príncipe (“the prince’s 
farmyard”) and el Corral de la Cruz (“the cross’s farmyard”). These corrales had a 
relatively small stage that had, at its sides, stands where the public could sit and, at the 
back, a wall that was known as the dressing building. It was precisely this wall that would 
open up in several ways to uncover different spaces that would oftentimes represent 
balconies which would accommodate the representation of remote places, magical effects 
or extraordinary events that extended the boundaries of reality (Ruano de la Haza and 
Allen). On the other hand, the Coliseo of Buen Retiro was already a theatre of Italian-
type plant, based on the Teatro Farnese in Parma (1618) with a larger stage, a proscenium 
arch, a curtain, space at the back to create the illusion of perspective, and machines to 
recreate special effects. 
43 
 
 
Apart from these indoor theatres, which were mainly dedicated to the public from the city 
and from the court, Calderón used to work in open spaces such as palace gardens –Amor, 
honor y poder (“Love, honour, and power,” 1623) was represented on three different 
stages; each act took place on a different stage–, ponds in Parque del Retiro, and diverse 
public venues such as squares and streets in Madrid. This diversity of theatrical spaces 
correlates well with the diversity of genres that were popular at the time and that could go 
from traditional comedy (“normal plays”), and autos sacramentales (religious plays of 
allegorical nature), the so-called brief genres (entremeses, jácaras, mojigangas, etc.), to 
zarzuela and opera. Although zarzuelas and operas were typically created with a royal 
theatre in mind, they were often represented in commercial theatres with less technology. 
This variety, which in Lope de Vega’s poetry is key to satisfying the taste of his 
demanding audience, manifests itself in the diversity of topics that these works deal with, 
which range from honour plays to comedias de capa y espada (cloak-and-dagger 
comedies) or enredo (comedies of situation) to the progressively more frequent presence 
of mythological topics in Calderón’s most spectacular plays (Neumeister). 
Independently of spaces and topics, it may be claimed that Spanish baroque theatre is a 
theatre of emotions that evolves thanks to its public’s unquenchable thirst for plays that 
were full of novelty and excitement. It is clear that as theatre plays gain in spectacularity, 
more technological and musical resources are used by the playwright to surprise his 
audience. On the other hand, literary and theatre devices are always present and were 
barely smothered by technology and special effects. Spanish baroque theatre had the 
intention to affect its audience’s imagination and senses, which, after all, shape their 
emotions. 
In the aforementioned division of Calderón’s works into comedies and autos 
sacramentales, it is commonplace to attribute a greater emotional content to the former 
since their rhetorical structure and the possible range of topics and characters allowed for 
greater creative freedom. The manner in which comedies were composed in Calderón’s 
time generally followed the rules and formalities postulated by Lope de Vega in his Arte 
nuevo de hacer comedias en este tiempo (“New Art of Writing Plays in This Time,” 
1609). However, authors were subject to an ever changing market due to the great 
44 
 
 
number of plays being presented at the same time and due to the sociological 
characteristics of the audience that attended the plays. 
The thematic scope of the autos sacramentales, always played in public venues during 
the feast of Corpus Christi and written to exalt the mystery of Eucharist (Casa, García 
Lorenzo and Vega García-Luengos, 19), is relatively more limited compared to other 
genres. To start with, the plays to be presented were selected by the city hall. As a 
consequence, only the most popular authors of the time were likely to be chosen to write 
the plays. In addition, the topic of the play was restricted to just the mystery of the 
Eucharist, which, at least, could be approached from a variety of perspectives, such as 
biblically or historically (Varey). It was certainly the allegorical nature of the majority of 
the characters –el Autor (the author), el Mundo (the world), el Pastor (the priest), la 
Belleza (the beauty), etc.– that restricted the rhetorical possibilities of authors such as 
Calderón (Arellano, “Historia” 691-697). In many passages, the autos devote many 
verses to gloss over very abstract theological issues such as guilt, freedom, grace or 
Creation, or use the characters as bearers of virtues and vices. Due to this, the autos 
sacramentales have been frequently studied as “intellectual” plays with an important 
theological and philosophical component that sent a specific anti-Protestant message to a 
homogeneous audience (Arellano, “Historia” 690-691), and are an essential part of the 
baroque counter-reformist Catholicism (Orozco). 
On the contrary, the reality of the autos is rather different as these are very complex 
works that appeal to the religious inclinations of spectators also by targeting their 
emotions (Suárez, “Complejidad” 58-74). If the social setting of the autos is marked by 
the Corpus Christi festivities and the celebration of the Eucharist, and there are strong 
theological messages that conform to the Catholic dogma, the dramatic nature of the 
autos still lives off the artist’ freedom and the open nature of the baroque work that are 
typical of 17th-century Spanish drama (Suárez, “El paisaje” 59-93). Regardless the social 
and religious role of the autos –or precisely, in order to be effective in fulfilling that 
45 
 
 
social role–, the main goal of the playwright was to move their audience by playing with 
emotions in the language, the staging and the evolution of the characters.18 
In this study, we have tracked down the extent of the presence of emotions in the text of 
Calderón’s autos with the help of a massive and, at the same time, detailed study of the 
sentiments expressed by the characters that Calderón created. Also, we have delved into 
the distribution of these emotions by studying the occurrence of positive and negative 
sentiments among different typologies of characters,19 so that we can offer a more 
nuanced view of the psychology of these characters, even when they are of allegorical 
nature. 
It may be claimed that the autos sacramentales fulfil the four characteristics that José 
Antonio Maravall used to describe the culture of the Baroque –directed, massive, urban, 
and conservative (Maravall, “La cultura”). They are, above all, dramatic spectacles that 
play an important role in spreading an ideological agenda more related to the Catholic 
Church and religion than to the apparatus of the state. As spectacles infused with the 
poetics of the Baroque, the autos sacramentales are very complex pieces of theatre, 
structured in such a way that they can appeal in different ways to the various social and 
economic groups that are the audience of early modern cities. That is, neither the 
homogeneity of the theological message that the autos are to convey nor the allegorical 
nature of the characters, precluded the authors from composing multi-layered plays that 
made the emotional brain of the spectator as their desired target. 
Thus, it is also true that the range of emotions and the intensity in which they were 
presented in the autos by Calderón also lent his craft to the principles of extremism and 
suspension that Maravall uses to define baroque techniques. That is, even if we accept 
that Calderón’s autos, and especially El gran teatro del Mundo (“The great theatre of the 
                                                 
18 Hilaire Kallendorf has argued in her Conscience on Stage. The Comedia as Casuistry in Early Modern 
Spain that baroque plays are built in part as complex and detailed arguments of casuistry and that in many 
cases these plays put on stage “troubled consciences” (159-162).

processing, text analysis and computational linguistics to identify and extract subjective information in

46 
 
 
world,” GT, 1635), are the best example of Maravall’s vision of the Spanish baroque, 
these same autos are built through a toolbox of rhetorical resources that rely on the 
senses, the imagination, and the emotions of the spectators. The rhetorical and 
spectacular resource to emotions and feelings in order to play with the audience’s 
emotional states fits in very well with what Angela Ndalianis called the “assault on the 
sensorium” (Ndalianis, Neo-Baroque), that Calderón exploits through the classical theory 
of imagination (Suárez, Escenario). 
This theory of imagination, based on Aristotelian psychology and brought to modernity 
thanks to multiple transformations, such as the one made by Avicena in his Canon (1020) 
or Pico della Mirandola in On the imagination (1536), claimed that imagination –one of 
the humans’ inner senses– was part of the human being and was used to filter what was 
perceived by external senses in its way to the most noble parts of the soul. In the 
neoplatonic branch of this tradition that highlights metaphorical knowledge (Martin, 46), 
imagination was also part of the human being and it had been formed with materials of 
the superior world, which was useful in order to explain why men had access to 
phenomena that belong to afterlife, to magic and astrology. Calderón would later on 
exploit all these elements as part of his theatrical practice in an attempt to amaze, affect, 
and suspend his audience’s emotions. The transition from psychology to dramatic poetry 
–also the poetry of baroque sermons– took place thanks to plays like Examen de ingenios 
para las ciencias (“The Examination of Men’s Wits,” 1575) by Huarte de San Juan and 
Philosophía Antigua Poética (1596) by Alonso López Pinciano (Suárez, Escenario). In 
this way, when Lope de Vega composed his Arte nuevo in 1609 and claimed that 
satisfying spectators’ thirst is the only criterion that an author should follow in order to be 
successful in the Spanish scene, he is basically adapting the theory of imagination within 
a baroque and modern aesthetics. In order to develop his theatre of imagination and 
emotions, Calderón was inspired by this aesthetic position and by diverse established 
practices in different decades of commercial theatre and public performances. 
In this way, a comprehensive study of the role of sentiments in the creation of the 
characters of the autos will help us understand how baroque theatre created massive 
successful performances for many decades precisely by appealing to sentiments and 
47 
 
 
opinions that the audience may have shared. It seems likely that the sensorium apparatus 
of the baroque theatre was much more complex and more dependent on the creation of 
emotions and sentiments than had been previously believed by mainstream critics of 
Calderón’s work (e.g., Neumeister; Orozco). 
In recent years, with the emergence of the World Wide Web and the so-called Web 2.0 
(O’Reilly), sentiment analysis has become an essential technique in the decision-making 
process.20 Most companies and brands covet consumers’ perceptions and opinions of 
their latest products so that their marketing strategies can be modified accordingly. The 
basic computational treatment of opinions consists in determining the semantic 
orientation of a text; that is, whether the text is expressing a positive or negative message. 
In order to establish this polarity, previously evaluated texts need to be provided to be 
used as a baseline upon which assess new and unseen text. Sentiment analysis is typically 
conducted using massive amounts of online comments and reviews already evaluated in 
popular sites, forums or social networks. Given this set of texts assessed by humans, 
techniques from natural language processing and machine learning allow us to build 
software programs able to predict the polarity of an arbitrary text. This software, usually 
referred to as classifier, allows companies to gain insight into what consumers loved most 
of their new car or what people disliked of their new gadget, always based on past 
opinions. 
In this process, the flow always goes from the people to the products, since it is the 
people who influence how the product will be modified in the future. The question we 
ought to ask, then, is whether we could use the inverse approach in order to influence 
how people feel by purposely altering a product feature. Taking this one step further, we 
could also ask whether people’s reactions could be altered by creating a specific 
discourse. Looking at the field of psychology, there seems to be evidence that one may 
do so. The anchoring effect, by which individuals, when given a hint or an “anchor” in a 
question, tend to choose a response that bears a relation to the initial anchor, is an 
example of how people’s reactions can be modified by the presence of a specific previous 
                                                 
20 Also known as opinion mining. 
48 
 
 
discourse (Strack and Mussweiler, 437). Whereas previous studies have examined the 
extent of this effect mainly through the interaction of a question and a subsequent 
response, we speculate that adding anchors in a more subtle way, namely, by using the 
power of the theatrical metaphor, rhetorical tools and interpretation will yield similar 
results. In fact, the importance of language in the creation of emotion experiences and 
perceptions has been recently brought to light in developmental and cognitive science: 
“language plays a role in emotion because language supports the conceptual knowledge 
used to make meaning of sensations from the body and world in a given context” 
(Lindquist, MacCormack, and Shablack). This notion of language as a “glue” that binds 
concepts to embodied experiences would allow Calderón to shape the processing of 
sensory information to create emotional experiences and perceptions. 
If this is so, we would be able to understand why Maravall plays around in his theory 
with two sets of ideas that are apparently contradictory. On the one hand, he defines 
baroque culture as a culture that is focused on the control of masses. On the other hand, 
he refers to certain mechanisms of play and baroque work creation that appeal 
fundamentally to the individual emotions of spectators. But if we accept that the massive 
nature of baroque plays makes the dispersion of ideological and religious information 
more efficient and that this dispersion makes use of mechanisms such as the provocation 
of emotional responses by means of the careful construction of the dramatic discourse, 
both parts of the Maravallian theory would be harmonised. In addition, we would have a 
more nuanced explanation of the complementarity of the resources that targeted the 
masses and those resources that targeted the emotional individuality of the urban 
spectators of different social classes. Thus, we hypothesise that this resource has been 
extensively used by authors of plays of all times. Specifically, we believe that Calderón 
de la Barca voluntarily used deception as a sophistry to spread subliminal messages to his 
audience, by means of having them empathise with some of the characters in his plays. 
Furthermore, the beginnings of the printing press in Spain, which brought with it the first 
articulation of mass media methods of dissemination in the 17th Century, also played an 
important role in the space occupied by Calderón in the machinery of sentiment-creation 
in baroque Spain. There is evidence to believe that as the coverage of an issue in the 
49 
 
 
media increases, the more accessible it will remain in the audience’s memories (Iyengar, 
1-15). It is very unlikely that gazette editors at the time knew about this effect known as 
the accessibility bias, and still personalities such as Juan de Austria, King Charles II of 
Spain’s favourite, commanded the creation of a gazette to promote his popularity. 
However, it would take at least another hundred years for the newspaper to become 
popular among the low class with the apparition of almanacs and signs. During this time 
the corrales filled the absence of an affordable medium ready to be consumed by a 
mostly illiterate population. Therefore, we propose that Calderón was one of the several 
successful subtle and elegant mass influencers of his time. We hypothesize that, through 
his works and their representations, Calderón had an influential effect on his audience 
similar to that of mass media nowadays (Ndalianis, Neo-Baroque). 
In order to demonstrate how Calderón tried to influence his audience’s reactions through 
his discourse, we based our study on the characters created by him in his autos as 
characterised by the Diccionario de los autos sacramentales de Calderón (“Dictionary of 
the autos sacramentales by Calderón”), first published in 2002 by Ignacio Arellano 
(“Diccionario”), which is, to this day, the most exhaustive and extensive account of the 
autos. We used the speeches of the characters as inputs for an automatic classifier 
previously built upon averaged real evaluations of all the sentences in 10 of the autos. 
3.2 Methodology 
Our dataset is composed of 73 of the plays included in the collection of autos by 
Calderón de la Barca edited by GRISO-Universidad de Navarra and Edition 
Reichenberger.21 This collection, which started in 1992 and is close to being completed, 
has achieved a major effort by collating a set of volumes with critical editions of all the 
autos ever written by Calderón de la Barca (including some of dubious attribution).22 As 
of today, 76 of the autos have been already edited, out of which only 3 were not included 
                                                 
21 See ‹http://www.unav.edu/centro/griso/›. 
22 For a list of the specific autos used in this study see Appendix. 
50 
 
 
in this study since this project demanded that the autos had the date of composition or the 
date of first publication.23 
In the critical editions of the autos, some criteria were taken into account by the autos 
editors that we disregarded for the purpose of our analysis. The first measure we took was 
to accept all the added omissions as part of the original text (i.e. [Nembrot y Salvajes], 
where the brackets mean that the text was originally missing and was later added by the 
editor, becomes simply Nembrot y Salvajes for us). We also decided to ignore all the 
texts that are not part of the speech of a character. This includes the omnipresent 
introduction of chirimías (shawms),24 and all the stage directions given by Calderón 
about where the character must go or who he/she must talk to, among other notes. 
Normalization of the names of the characters was another necessary step, so that, for 
example, the three variations of Melchisedech (Melquisedec, Melquisedech, and 
Melchisedec) could be treated as only one in our analysis. Unfortunately, this process was 
less straightforward in other cases, as is the case with Primer Adán (first Adam) and 
Segundo Adán (second Adam). As the purpose of our study was to identify how the 
characters’ speeches are perceived, we merged both Adams together despite their obvious 
different conceptions (Arellano, “Diccionario”), thus creating a unique Adán that would 
subsequently be included in a bigger category of characters. Furthermore, speeches made 
by more than one character at the same time were unified under the term Varios (several), 
which is a grouping of characters that does not appear per se in the autos. At the same 
time, Varios should not be confused with Todos (everyone), Toda la Música (all the 
music), or other variants, as these groupings of characters keep their original name in 
Calderón’s text and in our analysis. Finally, the verses that make up the speech of each 
character were put together and then split into sentences and words using a Punkt 
tokenizer for Spanish, a tool that is included in the software for natural language 
processing NLTK (Bird; Kiss and Strunk, 485-525). An example of some verses 
                                                 
23 Only plays with a date were considered as we aimed to find patterns of emotions over time. 
24 A shawm is a wind instrument profusely used by Calderón in his plays. Every time a shawm was 
introduced, and given its penetrating tone, usually a change took place in the play, either characters leaving 
or entering the scene, and end of act, or some other dramatic circumstance.

Once the texts were tabulated, we started the creation of a sentiment classifier in order to 
apply sentiment analysis on the texts. Sentiment analysis can be defined as the task of 
classifying the sentiment expressed in, or perceived from, a medium, normally a text. The 
type of materials that undergo sentiment analysis are typically user-generated content, 
such as texts extracted from social networks or review sites. For these cases, which 
present a lot of texts to be handled at the same time, an automated approach to classifying 
is much more desirable. Binary classification of text has existed in machine learning for a 
long time and current implementations of automatic classifiers are based on early works 
by Peter Turney and Bo Pang (Turney; Pang, Lee and Vaithyanathan),25 whose main goal 
was to identify the polarity (whether they were positive or negative) of products and 
movie reviews, like those in Amazon.com and IMDb.com web sites, respectively. 
Although their methodology was applicable to our study, we were forced to build our

own annotated corpus that would let us create a domain-specific classifier for two main 
reasons. Firstly, there is a clear difference in complexity between product reviews and 
17th-century Spanish Golden Age theatre. Secondly, there is a lack of annotated corpora 
available for sentiment analysis of theatre of this period. Creating our own annotated 
corpus allowed us to apply Turney and Pang’s methodology effectively. 
From the aforementioned set of autos,26 we randomly selected ten to be used as a training 
set for the rest of the autos: El cubo de la Almudena (“Almudenas’s pail,” CA, 1651), La 
humildad coronada de las plantas (“The crowned humility of plants,” HC, 1644), La 
hidalga del valle (“The noblewoman of the valley,” HV, 1634), El lirio y la azucena

ones,” LE, 1649), El árbol del mejor fruto (“The tree of the best fruit,” MF, 1661), No

will find strong women,” QH, 1676), El socorro general (“The general relief,” SG, 
1644).27 We then extracted the different sentences (more than 5,000) and fed two 
different crowd-sourcing systems with them. The first system was our own deployment 
of the open-source Python-based PyBossa,28 which asked 7 subject participants to read 
and assess the sentiment associated to the given sentences by using a discrete scale from -
2 to 2 (“Very Negative”, “Negative”, “Neutral”, “Positive”, “Very Positive”), until a 
redundancy of 3 evaluations per sentence was achieved. These participants were educated 
adults, between the age of 18 and 30 who completed the task for compensation. The 
second system was the Amazon Mechanical Turk (Paolacci, 411-419), where three 
different persons (which shared the profile of our PyBossa participants) assessed all the 
sentences. In this case, however, we were not able to define the scale and finished with a 
gradation from -1 to 1 (“Negative”, “Neutral”, and “Positive”) and also a redundancy of

3. In other words, we gauged positive and negative responses (including scales of 
intensity in each) which relate to emotional responses and that can serve as proxies of the 
emotional responses of Calderón’s audiences to the characters represented in the autos. 
The results derived from this study were used to build the database from which, later on, 
the classifier was developed. 
After normalising the different scales and averaging per sentence evaluation, we assigned 
the tag “pos” for values greater than 0, “neg” for lesser than 0, and rejected the rest since 
we were not interested in neutral evaluations. In order to create a binary classifier, which 
would be able to predict, given a sentence, which class it belonged to, “pos” or “neg”, we 
used the scikit-learn library (Pedregosa et al., 2825-2830), along with Pandas and the 
IPython Notebook (McKinney). We randomly split the annotated corpus into two sets: a 
training set with 80% of the sentences and a testing set with the remaining 20%. The 
slicing of the original corpus was later cross-validated. After trying several models, a 
stochastic gradient descent estimator (SDGC) with tf–idf weighting outperformed any 
other combination with an accuracy of 73.71%, precision of 75.26%, recall of 92.80% 
and an unweighted F-score of 83.11% (Blei, Ng and Jordan, 993-1022; Bifet and 
Frank).29 While a 73.81% might be seen as not accurate enough, Amazon Mechanical 
Turk reported that humans only agree 79% of the time,30 which makes the performance 
of our classifier almost as accurate as that of humans. 
We ran the classifier against the rest of the sentences (more than 30,000) and calculated 
the probability of a sentence being classified as either “pos” or “neg”. We also calculated 
the lexical diversity (defined as the number of distinct words divided by the total number 
of words), and the ratios of words per sentence and per verse, as the complexity of a text 
measured in terms of its lexicon is usually used for the assessment of the sentiment 
expressed. This gives us the materials to assess the emotional response to Calderón’s 
                                                 
29 Precision is a measure of hits vs. errors, while recall is a measure of hits vs. misses. High precision 
means that positive sentences do not end up classified as negative; high recall means that no negative 
sentences end up classified as positive. For a further explanation on the measures see Lewis and Ringuette.

texts and, therefore, to better understand the psychological evolution of these complex, 
albeit allegorical figures that make up the autos sacramentales. 
3.3 Typology of Characters 
In baroque Spanish comedies there are several typical characters –the villain, the young 
lady, the gallant, the king, the joker– that in some occasions are also used in the autos. 
When they are used in the autos, the allegorical side of the characters are wrapped up 
around these types. For example, the young lady can also be representing Beauty or the 
vice of Luxury, depending on the works, whereas the old man would be playing the 
figure of the Author. Given the hundreds of plays composed for the stage during this 
period –critics estimate that just Lope wrote around 500 plays– and the development of 
an appreciation for this theatre by the public, it is reasonable to assume that the public 
had certain expectations about the range of behaviours and emotions embodied by 
specific types of characters. At the same time, there is a level of ambiguity built into the 
poetics of Spanish baroque theatre as the model popularised by Lope in his Arte nuevo 
proclaimed the need to mix the comic and the tragic and make of hybrids a resource to 
surprise and impact the public.  
Some characters in the autos may seem to fall into recognisable types that could engage 
with specific emotional responses, as in the case of villains or heroes. Since there is a 
lack of a complete dictionary of the characters in the autos, an important part of our 
approach was to classify characters into different groups to locate the defining features of 
each. There is previous research on some of Calderón’s characters, either in specific 
plays or globally,31 but none that we are aware of have tried to classify all the characters 
into categories and analyse the positiveness of each group. In this context, “positive” 
means that the sentences of the characters of a category have been classified as positive 
by our classifier, and therefore those sentences would likely be assessed as expressing a 
positive sentiment by a human reader, and vice-versa for negativeness. We propose the 
next, not mutually exclusive, types of characters and let the analysis of the text declare 
                                                 
31 For example, see Ignacio Arellano (“Autos Sacramentales”), Entwistle (223), or Reyre 
56 
 
 
how the characters can be classified. With this classification we attempt to dispose of as 
much subjectivity as possible in order to avoid entering into the hermeneutics of the 
Calderón's creations. 
3.3.1 Gender 
Guessing the sex of a character was evident sometimes, but other times it was very 
deceptive. Characters such as Aarón, Adán, el Rey (the king), or Isaías are undoubtedly 
males. Incidentally, all the seven deadly sins, among other concepts usually perceived as 
negative, are feminine characters; as suggested by James Maraniss, this could have more 
to do with the Spanish language itself or even the Christian tradition than with a 
deliberate action on the part of Calderón, although it still “suits Calderón’s thought well 
enough” (Maraniss, 18-28). Therefore, when the sex of the character was not disclosed in 
the text, we proceeded in two different steps. To start with, if the character’s name 
coincided with a common noun of Spanish, such as Voz (voice), which is a feminine 
noun, we used the gender of the noun to tag the character as either male or female. If, on 
the contrary, the gender of the character could not be deduced from other accounts (such 
as historical or biblical) and its name was not an existing noun in Spanish, we used the 
gender of modifying articles and adjectives to assign masculine or feminine gender to the 
character. This was the case of Amalec, who could be a biblical figure or the 
representation of a tribe or a place. In this case, we classified this character as masculine 
because of the expression “Amalec valeroso” (brave Amalec), where the adjective is 
overtly masculine. 
3.3.2 (Existential) Plane 
This category covers the following cases in order of precedence: biblical characters such 
as Saulo (Saint Paul), theological abstractions like Penitencia (penance), allegorical 
incarnations as in los Cinco Sentidos (the five senses), mythological beings such as 
Andrómeda (in the Greek tradition, daughter of Cepheus and Cassiopeia), historical 
figures such as Almanzor (the de facto ruler of al-Andalus in the late 10th to early 11th 
centuries), or just people (real or fictional) in supporting roles, like Soldado (soldier) or 
Criado (servant). Gedeón, an actual historical warrior and biblical judge, is annotated 
57 
 
 
only as a biblical character because his biblical role has precedence over the historical 
one. 
3.3.3 Sphere 
This category encapsulates the social sphere that the character is normally associated 
with. As an example, el Rey is almost always linked to nobility, unlike the Segador 
(reaper), who is usually related to laymen, or el Sacerdote (priest), bound to clergy. With 
this classification we avoid the questionable class distinctions between ‘high and low’ 
character status and, at the same time, we come closer to a more sociological approach 
that goes beyond the traditional types normally described in the manuals of literary 
history. As proposed by Maravall, a realistic social distribution adds an “objective” 
sociological dimension based on the principles of identity, totality, and opposition which 
are expressed not in the individuals’ opinions, but in the collective action of the members 
of a specific sphere.32 Although this seems to fit well with some of the characters in the 
autos, others would not play a role in society as we usually conceive it nowadays, albeit 
being of vital importance in the allegorical world of Calderón. Examples of these 
characters are saints or allusions to Jesus Christ (classified as supernatural) and concepts 
of moral or psychological dimensions, such as Entendimiento (understanding), Justicia 
(justice) or Razón (reasoning). 
3.3.4 Role 
Occasionally, Calderón himself added additional information about the characters, either 
in the text or at the beginning of the play in the Personas (characters) section. Different 
values such as villain, gallant, shepherd, wise man, gipsy, or priest are included in this 
category. It was also very common that some characters, biblical or historical, were 
intended to be played as themselves. 
We could have created a typology as exhaustive as we would have wanted, for example, 
by splitting the social sphere to also cover the supposed addressee in the real world of 
                                                 
32 See García Lorenzo (“Calderón”) and Maravall and Martínez-Lázaro (“Estratificación” 48). 
58 
 
 
each character’s speeches or by differentiating their existential planes to include virtual 
artefacts, as in Labranza (farming), or physical ones, as in Esqueleto (skull) (Suárez, 
“Para Una Teoría”). However, such fine grained categorisations would end up having 
almost as many sections as there are characters, as such is the complexity of Calderón’s 
creations, thus becoming a pointless classification. Secondly, it would rely too much on 
the interpretation of the texts, losing all traces of the first intended objectivity. The 
categories we proposed are nuanced enough to differentiate almost each one of the 
characters, i.e., Levita is classified as a feminine character, in an allegorical plane of 
existence, member of the clergy, and playing the role of a priest in the auto. No other 
character in the autos shares the same classification. 
3.4 Quantitative Analysis of Autos 
We analysed more than 430 characters, whose combined discourses produced around 
613,000 words distributed in 140,000 verses and 37,000 sentences.33 The longest auto is 
El convite general (“The general reception,” CG, 1648) with 3,249 verses, followed by 
La nave del mercader (“The merchant’s ship,” NM, 1674), La viña del Señor (“The 
Lord’s vineyard,” VI, 1674), El cordero de Isaías (“The lamb of Isaiah,” CI, 1681) and 
El día mayor de los días (“The greatest day of the days,” DD, 1678). In the lower bottom 
of the list we find El primer blasón del Austria (“The first blazon of the Austria,” PB, 
1635), the shortest, and then El divino Jasón (“The divine Jason,” DJ, 1630), El gran 
duque de Gandía (“The Grand Duke of Gandía,” GD, 1639), La iglesia sitiada (“The 
besieged church,” IS, 1630), and Los encantos de la culpa (“The charms of guilt,” EC, 
1645). Regarding the complexity of the plays, Figure 2 shows their lexical diversity, 
sorted by year and ranging between 0 for texts with no unique words, to 1 for texts that 
never repeat a single word. The autos La vida es sueño (“Life is a dream,” VSP, 1635) 
and El divino Jasón (“The divine Jason,” DJ, 1630) are ranked as the most lexically 
diverse, whereas El convite general (“The general reception,” CG, 1648) and El día 
mayor de los días (“The greatest day of the days,” DD, 1678) as the least. 
                                                 
33 More than 4,500 stage directions were only used to annotate characters’ categories but not analysed. 
59 
 
 
 
Figure 3-1: Lexical diversity of autos over time. This graph illustrates the lexical 
diversity of the autos sorted by year. 
However, what is really important to notice is the fluctuation of lexical diversity as time 
progresses. In fact, this tendency still holds when grouping the autos by year, as shown in 
Figure 3. There seem to be no historical reasons for this and we cannot help but wonder 
whether this is an intended result by Calderón or just mere coincidence.

Figure 3-3: Verse-sentence ratio of autos over time. Number of verses per sentence 
in autos sorted by year. 
Given the fact that almost nothing is accidental in his work and that the diversity of a 
play is a measure of its richness, we hypothesise that Calderón was adjusting the 
complexity of his texts according to their audience. To further demonstrate this, we used 
a rough approximation of complexity: the ratio between the number of verses divided by 
the number of sentences. Longer sentences are split among many verses, thus making 
their meaning more difficult for the audience to grasp. Figures 4 and 5 show consistency 
with this result, although correlation is only significant between averaged values of 
lexical diversity and verse-sentence ratio, both grouped by year (Pearson coefficient of 
0.73, p-value < 0.01). Results are very similar for word-sentence ratio, and distributions 
are practically the same in both ratios (Pearson 0.97, p-value < 0.01). 
61 
 
 
 
Figure 3-4: Verse-sentence ratio over time. Average number of verses per sentence 
grouped by year. 
Furthermore, the length of the autos grouped by year is also inversely correlated with 
both verse-sentence ratio (Pearson -0.80, p-value < 0.01) and diversity (Pearson -0.90, p-
value < 0.01). In line with our intuitions, the longer the play, the less diverse and lower 
the number of verses per sentence. This could be a generalizable result or a clue about 
who the intended audience of each play was. On the other hand, the only relation between 
sentiments and the length of a play is a weak correlation with respect to the probability of 
a sentence being positive (the probability of a sentence being negative is just the opposite 
case) and averaged by auto (Pearson 0.46, p-value < 0.01, see Figure 5). 
This fact adds to our previous result about the length of autos, the longer the auto, the 
more positive is the overall sentiment classification of the play by our algorithm, which 
suggests that different autos were conceived with different emphasis for different 
audiences. Long, rich and positive plays, possibly with denser backgrounds and deeper 
meanings, could have been primarily intended for nobles and well-educated people. 
Short, plain, and negative autos were presumably addressed for the least educated sector 
of the population. Examples of the former include El convite general (“The general 
reception,” CG, 1648) or Lo que va del hombre a Dios (“So far this man to God,” LQ, 
1640), and Los encantos de la culpa (“The charms of guilt,” EC, 1645) or Los misterios 
de la misa (“The mysteries of the mass”, MM, 1640) for the latter. To further support this 
62 
 
 
idea, we resorted to our typology of characters, and discovered that shorter plays usually 
have more representation of characters in the social sphere of the laymen. In particular, 
we found that in the 10 shortest autos, the amount of verses of characters under the 
laymen category outnumbered those under clergy by an average factor of 12, those under 
nobility by 7, and those under supernatural by 4.  
 
Figure 3-5: Correlation between sentiment and length of autos. Distribution of the 
number of sentences in an auto and the probability of the auto being positive, 
calculated as the average of the probabilities of its sentences. 
These are the first pieces of evidence of Calderón’s attempts to empathise with his 
audience. Not only that, but these results would show a conscious effort from Calderón to 
engage in emotionally different ways with diverse audiences. This is to say that if the 
shorter autos show a tendency towards low social class characters and, in addition, send a 
generally negative message, we could hypothesise that such negativity outlines a feeling 
of fear that would drive these social classes to assent to their socio-political condition 
63 
 
 
without questioning the social and economic status quo. This conservative version of the 
baroque has been traditionally defended by many critics, who have typically centred their 
arguments on the auto El gran teatro del Mundo (“The great theatre of the world,” GT, 
1635). This auto certainly seems to support this political vision from a religious 
interpretation of the world: each of us has to accept the role they have been assigned in 
the play of life. 
It should be taken into account that the vast majority of autos ended up being represented 
in front of a diverse audience since they were meant to be shown in public celebrations in 
the streets of Madrid (and other cities). The fact that all sorts of audiences had access to 
these plays would question our hypothesis unless it were the case that the identification of 
the different types of public with their social equivalents was so strong and their 
sympathy for these characters was so profound that this psychological mechanism 
constituted a tool for Calderón to address his audiences in different ways. 
Another important aspect that should be explored more carefully is the relation between 
longer plays and the festive nature that is typically associated with later plays, which 
featured more musical and mythological content. This comparison is complicated 
because we do not always have specific information regarding the representations of the 
places and, in many cases, all we have is the dramatic text and some scattered 
information. We have proven that generally, the later the autos are composed the longer 
they are and, also, the more positive they become in terms of the emotions they convey. 
This is a direct result of the fact that later in his career Calderón devoted more and more 
effort to develop works of mythological theme that made part of the so-called baroque 
total art work and that became the backbone of festive spectacles filled up with 
technology, special effects, and music: they are the very first works of entertainment of 
the Early Modern Age. These pieces of entertainment water down the negative load of 
sentiments associated to earlier and more conservative plays. 
In any case, these results clearly show the intention and command of Calderón over the 
emotional effect that his plays would have on his public, his capability to regulate 
positiveness and negativeness of emotional messages, the choice of different social 
64 
 
 
groups are the main object of his poetry and the capability to alleviate emotionally the 
messages when play become more spectacular and technologically advances. Calderón 
would, therefore, be following what one of his characters says in the auto Los encantos 
de la culpa (“The charms of guilt,” EC, 1645): 
   Don't you see 
  that they are Human senses 
  and that in the end it is needed 
  relieves that divert them 
  from the fatigues they were born! 
(No ves 
que son sentidos Humanos 
y que al fin es menester 
alivios que los diviertan 
de las fatigas en que han nacido!) 
3.5 Character’s Sentiments 
Unfortunately, total numbers and global statistics do not contribute much to the 
understanding of the characters and audience’s perception of them. If Calderón was 
actually trying to promulgate empathy for specific characters, we need to look at the 
prevailing sentiment of their specific interventions. Using the results provided by our 
classifier and the different categories that we annotated the characters with, we know that 
characters such as Nacor, Criado (servant) or Leproso (leper) are among the ones with 
the most positive discourse as classified by our algorithm; while the interventions by 
Bernardo, Leví or Teutónico receive the most negative perception. Even with an 
impressive average probability of 98% of being positive, Nacor is not representative as 
his participation, which only takes place in the auto El viático cordero (“The viaticum 
lamb,” VC, 1665), barely counts up to 0.19%. For this reason, we ignore characters 
whose participation ratio is lower than 1%, measured as the result of dividing the number 
of verses of a character’s interventions by the total number of verses of the play. If the 
character appeared in more than one play, then the ratio of participation is averaged. 
65 
 
 
After excluding those, the characters with the most positive message are Dentro (the 
undetermined character used in the plays to designate that someone or some people are 
speaking outside the stage), Centro (center), Aqueronte, Aminta, Panadero (baker), 
Levita (Levite), Labranza (farming), Sísara, and Saúl. On the other side, the ones with 
the more negative sentiment are Ley (law), Melchisedech, Tiburtina, Pérsica, Orden 
Sacerdotal (priestly order), Felipe, Baptista, Templanza (temperance), Isaías, and 
Fortaleza (strength). Although this seems to be a hodgepodge of characters (both males 
and females, in different existential planes, and playing a variety of roles) some patterns 
start to emerge. 
 
Figure 3-6: Number of characters by plane. Total number of characters of each type 
in the category of existential plane 
As shown in Figure 6, allegorical characters represent the majority of cases in Calderón’s 
autos, followed by biblical characters, and then by the rest after a big gap. This result is 
in line with the notion of the autos serving as part of the machinery of the Catholic 
Church that sought to spread their values by means of allegories (Díaz Balsera, 87-88). 
Regarding our extended version of the social sphere, laymen count with the highest 
66 
 
 
number of characters, followed closely by nobility, theological, and moral (see Figure 7), 
which supports our previous claims and the importance given to spiritual affairs. 
Afterwards, supernatural, natural, and clerical characters form the next step, as they seem 
to be less represented in the play. Places, bureaucrats, and psychological concepts are in 
the lower bottom with the least number of characters. 
 
Figure 3-7: Number of characters by sphere. Total number of characters of each 
type in the category of the social sphere. 
In terms of positiveness of message, historical and allegorical characters count with the 
highest values, whereas biblical and mythological with the lowest ones; with respect to 
the social sphere, laymen, moral, and theological characters have the highest number of 
sentences classified as positive, while supernatural and members of the clergy have the 
lowest (see median values in Figure 8). Saints and other characters of the biblical 
dimension are the ones who have the most negative use of sentiments as derived from the 
artificially intelligent analysis of their interventions, sending a message that could be 
understood as them being non merciful. Allegorical allusions to laymen and abstract 
artefacts related to the moral and theological characters are sending positive messages to 
67 
 
 
the audience. We hypothesise that Calderón had a twofold purpose in doing so. Firstly, he 
intended to make his audience identify with certain types of characters of the play. 
Secondly, he also attempted to show his audience that the morality of the Catholic 
doctrine was positive for them. This would be in line with ideological interpretations of 
baroque theatre as an instrument to maintain social order and confirm the world view 
sustained by the Catholic faith.

averaged values of probability of positive sentiment by existential plane and gender. 
68 
 
 
 
Figure 3-9: Probability of positive sentence by gender. Probability of a sentence 
being classified as positive grouped by the gender of the character. 
With regard to gender, both masculine and feminine characters follow similar 
distributions, with female characters’ interventions having a slightly more positive 
perception (see Figure 8). However, it should be noted that the amount of female 
characters is half of males’ (55%). Therefore, women are under-represented in 
Calderón’s autos. When considering the total number of sentences and verses, the 
difference narrows down; female characters produce “only” 22% less sentences than 
men. 
69 
 
 
 
Figure 3-10: Distributions of sentiment by sphere and gender. Distributions of 
averaged values of probability of positive sentiment by social sphere and gender. 
However, the distinction between genders is accentuated when the existential planes and 
social spheres of the characters are analysed. Figures 8 and 10 show distributions of 
probability of positive sentiment for the categories of plane and sphere. In the existential 
plane, female characters of allegorical, biblical, or mythological nature have more 
sentences classified as positive than male ones, although historical figures seem to be 
more positive when incarnated as male characters. The case of real people –characters 
who do not represent historical nor biblical figures– shows the biggest difference, as 
female characters are depicted with a more negative sentiment than males. Regarding the 
social sphere, and excluding the case of bureaucrats, for which only a couple of 
masculine characters are found, median values of positive sentiment are higher for female 
characters when they represent characters in the laymen, clergy, nobility, nature, and 
supernatural spheres. 
Antonio Regalado, whose monograph on Calderón takes two volumes and over 1,800 
pages, discusses a feminism by Calderón in his comedies which would consist of 
representing the archetypical and mythical dimensions of the feminine figure in a context 
in which the vision of the feminine characters refutes the stereotypes and vulgarities 
about women (“Calderón” 981). The feminine figure shows the sensuality associated with 
70 
 
 
the feminine body and the complex intelligence of characters such as Semíramis in La 
hija del aire or the sorceress Circe in El mayor encanto amor. These are characters that 
clearly differ from their masculine counterparts. They are, in many cases, women that 
need to navigate the social difficulties of their time but they find an audience of their own 
in the women that would attend the theatres and would have a section for themselves to 
avoid contact with men and musketeers. 
Regarding the autos sacramentales, the topic of feminine eroticism stems from the 
adaptation of the comedy El mayor encanto amor as the auto Los encantos de la culpa 
(“The charms of guilt,” EC, 1645), in which the lecherous Circe represents, in a very 
nuanced manner, the pleasures that surround sin. On one hand, the religious and sinful 
dimension of pleasure has a presence. On the other hand, spectators witnessed the 
pleasures that derive from sexual intercourse and erotic games. Circe/Sin embodies a 
subjectivation of the world rooted in the myth and tries to compensate for the excesses of 
rationality and contempt with the world that the very auto imposes in its dimension of 
theological discourse. This subjective dimension, a sort of emotional identity typical of 
feminine characters, becomes apparent in the computational analysis of the autos and 
supports the coexistence of different ideological and emotional levels in the complex 
plays of baroque theatre. 
 Finally, we examine the case of the explicit role as assigned by Calderón himself 
in the autos. This case is especially intricate, as sometimes, although not very often, some 
characters start playing a role and during the play they change to a different one –for 
instance, in Las espigas de Ruth (“The [wheat] ears of Ruth,” ER, 1663), Ruth starts as a 
reaper and ends playing the role of villain in the same play. In those cases, we kept the 
first identifiable role. As Figure 11 illustrates, there is no correlation between the number 
of characters playing a specific role and the probability of their sentences being positive. 
However, some interesting results can still be extracted when observing the data. The set 
of the three more numerous roles, gallants (with 22 women and 11 men), villains (12 and 
17), and characters being played as themselves (8 and 23), account for almost 25% of all 
the characters, with values of probability of positive sentiment around the average of 
70%, although villains have a slightly higher value. This suggests that Calderón was 
71 
 
 
trying to polarise the main discourse of the autos by having on stage characters that were 
easily identifiable, while he added all the necessary complexity to make the plays 
interesting and surprising by making the discourse of other types of characters more 
positive. 
 
Figure 3-11: Number of characters and probability of positive sentiment by role. 
Total number of characters of each type in the category of the role given explicitly 
by Calderón in the auto, as well as the probability (from 0 to 1) of their sentences 
being classified as positive. 
Moreover, counter-intuitively, the characters with the highest values of probability of 
positive sentiment are those of non-Christian tradition: Muslims, Philistines, Jews, and 
Hebrews. This, again, was an exercise of Calderón to mislead the audience with 
arguments that not always fit the expected character prototype. Sentences from apostles, 
priests and prophets, although not very numerous, have the highest probability of being 
classified as negative, which apparently contradicts the idea of Baroque plays and autos 
72 
 
 
specially as being homogeneous representations of a given ideology and religious world 
view. 
3.6 Discussion 
Our results show agreement with the proposed thesis of this study. Analysing characters 
and their speeches in Spanish Golden Age theatre in an objective manner is not an easy 
task, and some of the assumptions and decisions we made could be argued against. 
Machine learning techniques and natural language processing are obviously worthwhile 
when applied to vast amounts of texts, but this study does not try to substitute the 
thorough job of the traditional philological analysis of the experts in the field. On the 
contrary, it tries to complement and give them support by providing them with a valuable 
source of information and data. Even the most accurate of the classifiers can be in trouble 
when facing rhetorical figures. This is why we tried to take into account as much data as 
possible so that we minimise the effect of outliers. 
3.7 Conclusions 
Alongside this study, we have analysed almost 37,000 sentences constructed from verses 
in dramatic and allegorical plays. Since our main objective was to demonstrate whether 
Calderón could be considered a mass influencer or not and what artefacts he used to do 
so, we built an automated classifier to annotate all the sentences in his works. Afterwards, 
we tagged all the sentences and characters of the plays and discovered the predominance 
of characters of allegorical and biblical dimension in the social spheres of nobility, 
laymen, and theological abstractions, which clearly compose the intended audience of the 
autos as these were stage in public spaces and free of charge for all the population of 
Madrid. 
Women seem to be slightly under-represented when compared to men, which could be 
considered normal taking into account the different society and the time the plays were 
written. On the other hand, female members of lay, clergy, nobility, and supernatural 
spheres, have more sentences classified as positive, which leaves men as the authority of 
moral and soul-related affairs, as long as our typology of characters is concerned. 
73 
 
 
We can conclude by saying that the architecture of sentiments in Calderón’s autos is as 
complex as the dramatic structure of baroque plays, and that the various metaphysical and 
rhetorical interconnected levels of baroque technologies of speech make it difficult to 
draw firm conclusions about the empathy of the characters and the machination of the 
messages by baroque authors. Data, however, can be contradictory sometimes. For 
example, according to our methodology, villains’ speeches are classified as positive, 
which is in line with the notion of the engaño (deceit) practised in the Baroque, but 
villains are not the ones with the highest values of positive messages –Philistines, 
Muslims, and Jews count even higher values. In other cases, it is hard to decide whether 
Calderón was using characters’ speeches to send clear religious messages or just as 
devices to fooling the audience and playing with the public. Be that as it may, the twisted 
nature of the Baroque is once again brought to light. 
Acknowledgments. This study has been possible thanks to the collaboration of GRISO 
Group at Universidad de Navarra, who kindly provided us with electronic text versions of 
all the plays, and the funding provided by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research 
Council of Canada.

4 The Life of Lazarillo de Tormes and of His Machine 
Learning Adversities. Non-traditional authorship 
attribution techniques in the context of the Lazarillo 
Summit work of the Spanish Golden Age and forefather of the so-called picaresque 
novel, The Life of Lazarillo de Tormes and of His Fortunes and Adversities still remains 
an anonymous text. Although distinguished scholars have tried to attribute it to different 
authors based on a variety of criteria, a consensus has yet to be reached. The list of 
candidates is long and not all of them enjoy the same support within the scholarly 
community. Four of the most recently supported and plausible candidates are the 
diplomat Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, defended by alleged historiographic and 
paratextual evidence; Alfonso de Valdés, humanist, chancellor of the Emperor Charles V, 
and brother of Juan de Valdés, both proposed as authors according to their writing style 
and biographical circumstance; and Juan Luis Vives, scholar and godfather of 
psychology, whose authorship candidacy follows the same precepts than those of Alfonso 
de Valdés. The last one, and one of the most recent candidates is the jurist from 
Valladolid Juan Arce de Otálora, who graduated in Law in the city of Salamanca and 
apparently suits the internal statistical evidence. In this study we build upon knowledge 
collected by experts on the topic to create a valid pool of possible candidates. Analyzing 
their works from a data-driven perspective and applying machine learning techniques for 
style and text fingerprinting, we shed light on the authorship of the Lazarillo. As in a 
state-of-the-art survey, we discuss the methods used and how they perform in our specific 
case. 
4.1 Introduction 
The authorship of The Life of Lazarillo de Tormes and of His Fortunes and Adversities –
usually referred to as the Lazarillo de Tormes, or just (and henceforth) the Lazarillo– is a 
topic that has interested researchers ever since the story was first published. The earliest 
87 
 
 
preserved editions were printed in 1554 in Burgos (Spain), Alcalá de Henares (Spain), 
Medina del Campo (Spain),35 and Antwerp (Belgium), although there might be at least 
two earlier editions yet to be found that complete the phylogenetic tree (figure 1 shows a 
possible stemma).36 After a short period of popularity, in 1559 it was added to the Index 
of forbidden books compiled by the Inquisitor General Fernando de Valdés,37 and 
therefore banned from public circulation due to its acid anti-clerical criticism.38 The 
text’s religious aspects have been particularly influential in scholars’ attempts to create an 
accurate profile of the anonymous writer. The author has been therefore considered to be 
a converted Jew (Castro, “Perspectiva” 123-138; “Hacia Cervantes” 149-166), an 
illuminist (Asensio, “La intención religiosa” 78-102; Asensio, “Más sobre el Lazarillo” 
245-50), or an erasmist (Márquez Villanueva, 107-I37), but these theses have been 
deeply questioned by acclaimed critics such as Marcel Bataillon and Eugenio Asensio, 
who depict the author as a humanist (Bataillon, “Erasmo y España” 609-611; “Novedad y 
fecundidad” 1-25; Pícaros y picaresca 215-243; Asensio, “El erasmismo” 31-99; Asensio, 
“La peculiaridad” 339-343). Nevertheless, the notion of an author in contact with such 
spiritual and ideological interests still persists in the literature, which could have 
informed their decision not to sign the little book. 
                                                 
35 The edition of Medina del Campo is the newest found. It appeared in 1992 hidden inside a wall, together 
with other texts that could be considered problematic by the Inquisition (Cañas Murillo). 
36 It is believed that the editions of 1554 are actually second editions following the success of a first edition 
of the book published as early as 1538, as suggested by Navarro Durán as the post quem of the little book: 
“el autor sólo puede referirse a las primeras [Cortes] porque no sabe que se van a celebrar unas segundas, 
ya que el Lazarillo se escribió antes de 1538,” (“the author can only be referring to the the first [Cortes] as 
he does not know that there will second ones, due to the fact that the Lazarillo was written before 1538”) 
(Navarro Durán 2002a, 7-13). See also the analysis by Francisco Rico in his introduction to his edition 
(Anónimo ed. Rico, 13-15), or the section “Las ediciones desconocidas” by José Caso González’s 
(Anónimo ed. Caso González, 11-14; Caso González, “La primera edición” 189-206). More recently, 
Arturo Rodríguez and Alfredo Rodríguez López-Vázquez based on weak documental proof (not the edition 
itself) and stemmatics supported an earliest edition in 1550 (Rodríguez and Rodríguez López-Vázquez). 
37 Later Rome’s Index Librorum Prohibitorum by Pope Pius VI also included books that could be re-edited 
prior partial censorship. 
38 See for example Manuel J. Asensio (“La intención” 78-102) and Víctor De la Concha (243-77). Reyes 
Coll-Tellechea argues that the real reason for the addition of the Lazarillo to the Index was the publication 
of the second part Segunda Parte del Lazarillo de Tormes, which was read as a political provocation and 
therefore never released again until the end of the Index (“The Spanish” 75-97).

Cañas Murillo. X and Y denote lost editions, being X the editio princeps or “true first 
edition”.39 Aldo Ruffinatto’s stemma also takes into consideration Juan López de 
Velasco’s Lazarillo Castigado after an analysis following the principles of ecdótica 
(ecdotic analysis) (Anónimo ed. Aldo Ruffinatto; Ruffinatto, “La princeps” 249-96; 
“Algo más” 523-36). 
It was not until 1573 that a censored version was circulated again in Spain, but omitting 
treatises 4 and 5 and assorted paragraphs from other parts of the book. Juan López de 
Velasco, Philip II of Spain’s cosmographer and historian, was the person responsible for 
the trimming of the Lazarillo, whose edition is known as the Lazarillo Castigado 
(Lazarillo Punished) (Asensio, “La intención”). The exerted censorship was subtle but 
radical as it transformed the identity of the Lazarillo turning the protagonist from “a 
victim of the socio-economic circumstances into a Lázaro responsible of his own social 
and moral condition” (“[Dichas alteraciones] estaban dirigidas a transformar la imagen de 
un Lázaro víctima de las circunstancias socioeconómicas en un Lázaro responsable de su

directamente del arquetipo X perdido, y la mayor limpieza de sus lecciones, parte de las cuales 
coinciden significativamente con Amberes, más corregido, insistimos, que Burgos y Alcalá, hay 
que concluir que dicha rama hay que hacerla depender también directamente del arquetipo X. 
(The text of Medina del Campo does not come from any of the versions preserved until now. It 
constitutes an independent textual branch. Given its proximity to that of Burgos, which comes 
from the lost archetype X, and the greater cleanness of its lessons, many of which significatively 
match with Amberes, more proofread, we insist, than Burgos and Alcalá, we conclude that such 
branch must depend on the archetype X too.)

condición social y moral.”)40 Although the work by Juan López de Velasco allowed the 
Lazarillo to leave the list of forbidden books, by then the Antwerp’s edition, translated to 
different languages, had already spread over Europe.41 It is suggested that the book that 
actually started the picaresque novel and influenced so many authors afterwards was in 
fact the censored edition. Until the final abolition of the Inquisition and the end of the 
Index in 1834, the Lazarillo Castigado was the only edition officially available in Spain 
for more than 250 years. If the Lazarillo Castigado was indeed the seed of the picaresque 
genre, then we would possibly have a preliminary explanation for two gaps unaccounted 
for: first, the time elapsed between the publication of Lazarillo in 1554 and the 
appearance in 1626 of the next considered picaresque novel, The Swindler (El Buscón) by 
Quevedo; and second, the difference between the deterministic style of the Lazarillo and 
the cruel reality that punishes the rogue for his aspirations in the following titles that 
became later on a more common topic in the genre. Unfortunately, the argument of 
Lazarillo Castigado being the book that started the picaresque genre does not count with 
the discussion around the date of the princeps and relies heavily on the idea of nobody 
using alternative channels of distribution or being rebellious against the establishment. 
Given the circumstances involved in the discovery of the edition of Medina del Campo 
we must take this suggestion with uncertainty (Alberto Martino, Lazarillo). Nevertheless, 
the importance of the figure of Juan López de Velasco does not end with his cleverly 
expurgated edition, as we will see soon. 
4.2 A Book by Many Authors 
The list of possible authors has grown with the years along with the painstaking effort of 
many researchers who devoted their time, intelligence, and expertise –sometimes even 
through their entire careers (see tables 1 and S1)– to this text. A noble and scientific goal 
has guided them to put an end to the enigma and to unveil the true identity of the author 
                                                 
40 See Coll-Tellechea (“Lazarillo Castigado” 32-33). Others limit the extent to which the trimming affected 
the story of Lázaro (Agulló y Cobo, A vueltas). 
41 By 1596 there were already editions published in London (England) with Diego Hurtado de Mendoza as 
the author. See chapter 2 of the precise and exhaustive work by Alberto Martino, and also his second 
volume dedicated to the reception of the Lazarillo in Europe.

of the Lazarillo. These 400 years of attributions have left us an insane, nearly intractable, 
amount of bibliography that must be reviewed and studied before dreaming of making a 
contribution to the state-of-the-art. It has become very hard to avoid certain feelings of 
genuine argumentum ad verecundiam, at least in the initial stages of the research. This 
amount of bibliography, paradoxically, instead of keeping novel scholars away has not 
been a deterrent and new proposals are still being added to the pool of candidates today, 
although some of them using modern and less explored methods (mostly computational) 
that were not available a decade or so ago. It is with respect to these techniques that we 
try to limit ourselves in the present study. 
Chronologically, the first attribution occurred more than half a century after the earliest 
known edition. In 1605 the Hieronymite Friar José de Sigüenza was the first to propose a 
possible author: the also friar, Juan de Ortega. Father Sigüenza’s Historia de la Orden de 
San Jerónimo (History of the Order of Saint Jerome) gathers his finding of a manuscript 
of the Lazarillo in the cell of Juan de Ortega (Sigüenza, 145): 
It is said that while being a student in Salamanca [i.e., Juan de Ortega], as a 
young man, he had such a fresh and gallant ingenuity, that he created that little 
book that moves around titled Lazarillo de Tormes, where he shows in that 
humble subject his mastery of the Castilian language and the decorum of the 
people introduced with such singular artifice and grace, that it deserves to be 
read by those of excellent taste. The reason for this was the discovery of the draft 
in his cell, handwritten by him. 
(Dicen que siendo [i.e., Juan de Ortega] estudiante en Salamanca, mancebo, 
como tenía un ingenio tan galán y fresco, hizo aquel librillo que anda por ahí, 
llamado Lazarillo de Tormes, mostrando en un sujeto tan humilde la propiedad 
de la lengua castellana y el decoro de las personas que introduce con tan 
singular artificio y donaire, que merece ser leído de los que tienen buen gusto. El 
indicio desto fue haberle hallado el borrador en la celda, de su propia mano 
escrito). 
91 
 
 
Although a draft was indeed found in the friar’s cell, the circulation of handwritten copies 
was a common practice during the Spanish Golden Age (Botrel and Salaün). The claim 
that Father Ortega was the author is hard to sustain as the draft does not seem to be 
enough proof: it could have been the original as much as a handwritten copy or some 
annotated summary made by Juan de Ortega. 
More than three centuries had to go by until the French hispanist Marcel Bataillon 
revisited the candidacy of Father Ortega, finding a satisfactory explanation for the 
anonymity of the Lazarillo. Friar Juan de Ortega received the habit in the Salamancan 
municipality of Alba de Tormes, and soon was chosen by King Charles V, Holy Roman 
Emperor, as archbishop of Chiapas in Mexico. He later became General of the 
Hieronymites from 1522 to 1555, which according to Bataillon, would sufficiently and 
objectively explain the reason of his not signing the little book around its publication in 
1554.42 Supporters of Bataillon’s candidate include Claudio Guillén or Antonio Alatorre, 
who in 2002, and as a very final assertion, stated that “there is nothing comparable to the 
testimony of Friar José de Sigüenza” (“No hay nada comparable al testimonio de fray 
José de Sigüenza”), suggesting that his sole mention was enough evidence (Alatorre, 
447). It is likely that his statement be based on the idea defended by Bataillon that a book 
of the tone and kind of the Lazarillo would not be gratuitously attributed to a 
Hieronymite Friar. However, as noted by Francisco Rico, it is hard to know whether 
Father Sigüenza was even referring to the right Juan de Ortega (Anónimo ed. Rico, 120). 
A couple of years after the proposal of Friar Juan de Ortega, another name took the centre 
stage and has probably been the most studied candidate ever since. In 2010 Alexander 
Sandy Wilkinson found editions of the Lazarillo made in 1599 in Zaragoza (Spain) by 
Juan Pérez de Valdivieso, and in 1600 in Rome (Italy) by Antonio Facchetti; both 
attributed the book to the diplomat and Governor of Grenade Diego Hurtado de 
Mendoza.43 Surprisingly, these references went unnoticed, as it was only after his 
mention in the Catalogus clarorum Hispaniae scriptorium that the candidacy of the poet 
                                                 
42 To this respect see the works by Marcel Bataillon (El sentido; Novedad y fecundidad). 
43 Following the citation in Corencia Cruz (16); see Wilkinson (652 and 414).

became popular. The Flemish bibliographer Valerio Andrés Taxandro wrote his 
Catalogus in 1607,44 and in it he said that Diego Hurtado de Mendoza “owned a rich 
library of Greek authors, that he gifted to King Philip II of Spain on his death. He [i.e., 
Diego Hurtado de Mendoza] also wrote romance poetry and the book of entertainment 
titled Lazarillo de Tormes” (“Poseía rica biblioteca de autores griegos, que dejó al morir 
a Felipe II. Compuso también poesías en romance y el libro de entretenimiento llamado 
Lazarillo de Tormes”) (Anónimo ed. Cejador y Frauca). A year later the Jesuit Andrés 
Schott also supported the attribution in his Hispaniae bibliotheca: “It is thought that the 
Lazarillo de Tormes is a work of his, book of satire and entertainment of his time as a 
student of civil law in Salamanca” (“Se piensa ser obra suya el Lazarillo de Tormes, libro 
de sátira y entretenimiento de cuando andaba estudiando derecho civil en Salamanca”).45 
Accepting the attribution as true, Tomás Tamayo de Vargas confirmed it again in his 
Collection of books the biggest that Spain has ever seen in its language up to 1624 (Junta 
de libros la mayor que ha visto España en su lengua hasta 1624): “Book of the most 
ingenious of Spain, and I do not know if in the foreign nations there is another of similar 
finesse in its subject. Valladolid by Luis Sánchez. 1603. 16º. Usually it is attributed this 
gracious birth to the ingenuity of Mr. Diego de Mendoza” (“Libro de los mas ingeniosos 
de España, i no sè si en las naciones estranjeras hai otro de igual festividad en su 
assumpto. Valladolid por Luis Sanchez. 1603. 16º. Communmente se atribuie este 
graciosissimo parto al ingenio de D. Diego de Mendoza”).46 Nicolás Antonio also 
contributed to the diffusion of Hurtado de Mendoza as the author, although he never 
completely rejected the previous candidate, Friar Juan de Ortega.47 Despite the vague 
explanations, based mostly on the lack of evidence against him and some biographical 
similarities between him and Lázaro’s life, the attribution proved to be extremely 
                                                 
44 Some authors argue that Valerio Andrés Taxandro was a pseudonym of Andrés Schott, see for example 
Francisco Calero (“Vives y el Lazarillo”). 
45 The citation can be found virtually in any edition of the Lazarillo or study about its authorship, we use 
Rico’s 2011 edition. However, the original, in latin, belongs to Andreas Schott.

popular. For about three centuries book catalogues all over Europe recorded Diego 
Hurtado de Mendoza as the author of the Lazarillo. 
The first serious criticism against this authorship came from another French hispanist 
Alfred Morel-Fatio, who in 1888 proposed a new candidate, Juan de Valdés –to whom 
we will come back later–, giving a start to the modern attribution wars of the Lazarillo 
(Morel-Fatio, 112-76). Alfred Morel-Fatio’s main claim was alluding to the number of 
attributions granted to Hurtado de Mendoza that were based solely on his reputation as 
enfant terrible, literarily speaking. All the objections against Hurtado de Mendoza that 
Morel-Fatio formulated were refuted several times by Ángel González Palencia.48 The 
Arabist and literary critic also noted some analogies between the uninhibited character of 
the Lazarillo and the tone employed by Hurtado de Mendoza in his private 
correspondence; albeit of acknowledging the stylistic dissimilarities to later conclude that 
the attribution “is not unlikely” (“no es improbable”) (González Palencia, “Leyendo el 
Lazarillo” 36): 
It shall not be emphasized the stylistic aspect of the Lazarillo with purposes of 
comparison to the works by Mendoza: the dry, short, and succinct style of the 
Lazarillo agrees to that of Mendoza’s letters and others prose works of him. 
However, this aspect should not be highlighted, considering that such writings, as 
a post data, and for commenting news or events, had to be written inevitably 
hastily, in a shortened, fast, and edgy way. 
(No puede hacerse gran hincapié en el aspecto estilístico del Lazarillo para 
compararlo con los escritos de Mendoza: el estilo seco, cortado y conciso del 
Lazarillo concuerda con el de estas cartas de Mendoza y con otras obras en 
prosa suyas. Pero acaso no se le pueda y deba dar gran valor a este punto, 
teniendo en cuenta que tales escritos, en forma de postdata, y para comentar una 
                                                 
48 See his edition of the Lazarillo (Anónimo ed. González Palencia; “Leyendo el Lazarillo” 3-39). From 
1941 to 1943, and together with Eugenio Mele, they also collected, edited, and published the works and 
biography of Diego Hurtado de Mendoza (González Palencia and Mele).

noticia o un suceso, habían de escribirse forzosamente de prisa, en forma 
abreviada, rápida y nerviosa). 
The ideas presented by the critic laid the foundations for other scholars, specially for 
Erika Spivakovsky. Unlike González Palencia, who believed that Hurtado de Mendoza 
wrote the Lazarillo when still young –following on Andrés Schott’s footsteps–, the 
American researcher gave a much later date for the conception of the book, effectively 
defending that the little novel was written in 1553, which coincided with the mature years 
of Diego de Mendoza. “We have few notices about Mendoza during 1553-1554 [writes 
Erika Spivakovsky]. Yet so much is known that, remarkably, he did not only had just the 
time and opportunity to do some writing for his own pleasure, but it seems to have been, 
in fact, the only period of his active middle years when he might have found a few weeks 
of complete leisure to perfect such as masterpiece” (“The Lazarillo” 273). The sentence 
summarizes her most important contribution to the debate: a noticeably precise series of 
parallels drawn between Hurtado de Mendoza’s life and the fortunes and adversities of 
Lázaro de Tormes and those whom he found in his path. The analogies are numerous, e.g. 
between Pope Paul III and the Blindman, the Sienese conspirator Amerigo Amerighi and 
the Cleric, or Charles V and the young Squire.49 
As convincing as it may sound, without factual evidence the intellectual exercise by 
Spivakovsky, and the whole Diego Hurtado de Mendoza candidacy, falls exclusively on 
the realms of metaphor and hermeneutics. At least until 2010, when Mercedes Agulló 
claimed to have found the missing piece of the puzzle. The Madrilenian historian 
published a monograph detailing the testament and inventory of goods of Diego Hurtado 
de Mendoza, as recorded at his death by the administrator of his estate, Juan López de 
Velasco. In one of the drawers containing books of López de Velasco,50 among other 
                                                 
49 See Spivakovsky (“¿Valdés o Mendoza?” 15-23) her book Son of the Alhambra. Others such as Olivia 
Crouch and Charles Vincent Aubrun also supported the idea, but added little to the discussion (Crouch, 11-
23; Aubrun, 240). 
50 The drawer was part of López de Velasco’s will, but Agulló defends that since everything that was in the 
drawer belonged to Hurtado, and Velasco was the executor of Hurtado’s will, the drawer belonged to 
Hurtado as well. 
95 
 
 
panniers belonging to Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, there was one that read: “a bundle of 
corrections made for the printing of Lazarillo and Propaladia” (“Vn legajo de 
correçiones hechas para la ynpressión de Laçarillo y Propaladia”) (Agulló y Cobo, A 
vueltas 44). The sentence, together with other surrounding historical circumstances, was 
sufficient for Mercedes Agulló to cautiously relaunch the old candidacy of the 
diplomat.51 The finding must not be minimized though, as it is the best documentary 
evidence to date. However, it is also true that all the documents were released as part of 
Juan de Valdés’ will, the lawyer who made the inventory of Juan López de Velasco’s 
fortune, which in turn included that of Hurtado de Mendoza. Although Agulló argues that 
Diego Hurtado de Mendoza’s files were bundled together and distinguishable from those 
of the executor of his will, the fact that López de Velasco was the person in charge of the 
Lazarillo Castigado makes the statement gain some uncertainty: the corrections as such 
are lost and another book is mentioned along with the Lazarillo. Strong reactions and 
criticism came shortly after Agulló published her work. In the same year several essays 
appeared refuting her findings, all of them mostly centered around the aforementioned 
questions about the impossibility of stating much about Diego Hurtado de Mendoza’s 
authorship: it is not clear why Hurtado de Mendoza would have made corrections to 
Bartolomé Torres Naharro’s Propalladia (Propaladia); and it might make more sense 
that the corrections were made by the censor Juan López de Velasco himself prior to the 
preparation of his expurgated edition.52 And although some openly supported Mercedes 
Agulló,53 she defended herself in a second article published a year later. The historian 
suggested then that López de Velasco, in order to work on his expurgated edition, called 
                                                 
51 The most notable is the overtly expressed desire of Philip II of acquiring the extensive and rich library of 
Diego Hurtado de Mendoza. The rejection of Mendoza to the king might be, in Mercedes Agulló’s opinion, 
the root of all enmity between them both, and the factor that would determine Philip II’s decisions in 
relation to Diego Hurtado de Mendoza’s fate. 
52 Example of this are Navarro Durán (“Diego Hurtado”), Javier Blasco (“Book Review” 1-9) or Fernando 
Rodríguez Mansilla (“A vueltas” 37). José Luis Madrigal carried an independent computational analysis to 
later conclude that there were no traces of Diego Hurtado de Mendoza’s writing in the Lazarillo (“Hurtado 
de Mendoza y el Lazarillo”). 
53 Supporting Mercedes Agulló, Pablo Jauralde Pou wrote a very detailed biography of Diego Hurtado de 
Mendoza relating for each of his life events the equivalent in the story of Lázaro, defending that the 
Grenadian wrote the little book after falling from the grace of Emperor (“Sin que de mi nombre”). See also 
Coll-Tellechea (“Book Review” 1-9). 
96 
 
 
upon Hurtado de Mendoza to provide him with the right corrections, thus being the 
nature of the legajo (bundle) referred in López de Velasco’s documents. Agulló uses the 
attribution to explain the nature of a book: Hurtado de Mendoza sent a letter to his 
nephew, to which said book was attached. In this letter, Hurtado asked his relative to 
hand in the book to Philip II, then still a young prince, and to warn the future king not to 
take the book too seriously, as Hurtado did not want to be on the spotlight on account of 
the told “necedades” (“follies”).54  She leaves, however, other mysteries to the reader, 
such as the reason for the absence in Hurtado’s library of many of the books that are 
believed to have influenced the Lazarillo, arguments sometimes used against Hurtado de 
Mendoza’s candidacy but that require a more thorough research.55 
In the long process of debating against Diego Hurtado de Mendoza’s authorship, other 
names were brought to light. In 1867 José María Asensio published previously unseen 
work by the dramatist, jurist, and Toledo born, Sebastián de Horozco. Representación de 
la historia evangélica del capítulo nono de San Juan (Representation of the evangelical 
history of the ninth chapter of Saint John) exhibits –according to José María Asensio– 
some similarities between a blind man guide character named Lázaro and the protagonist 
of the Lazarillo (Sebastián de Horozco 46), Julio Cejador y Frauca, after rejecting other 
authors such as the Valdés brothers, Cristóbal de Villalón, or Lope de Rueda, took José 
María Asensio’s suggestion and supported it with ever more similitudes, matches of 
themes and characters, and some biographic coincidences: “It was written, by whoever, 
in Toledo, even though [the author] sets the beginning of the action in Salamanca and 
appears himself knowledgeable about that city [...], this points out [...] entirely to 
Sebastián de Horozco” (“Escribiolo, fuera quien fuera, en Toledo, aunque ponga el 
comienzo de la acción en Salamanca y se muestre bien enterado de aquella ciudad […] 
esto compete […] de lleno a Sebastián de Horozco”).56 The inclination towards popular 
                                                 
54 “Vuestra Merced no se le dexe mucho en las manos porque no / Me anden exsaminando necedades” 
(“Your Grace does not leave it for long in the hands so / [they] do not start examining me follies”) (Agulló 
y Cobo, “Un par de vueltas más” 273-276).

Hobson.

sayings in Horozco’s works ended up convincing Cejador of the candidacy of the 
Toledan. However, just a year later Emilio Cotarelo started the publication of Sebastián 
de Horozco’s Refranes glosados (Glossed sayings), where the candidacy of the jurist was 
solidly rejected and abandoned by everyone else ever since (Horozco ed. Cotarelo). It 
was forty years later when Francisco Márquez de Villanueva brought this candidacy back 
without adding much to the debate; his name and authority, however, would suffice for 
many others to also rethink about and support it. Up to two times Francisco Rico rejected 
Horozco’s candidacy arguing that the use of the language was very different between the 
two books. While it seems to be evident that the Toledan took some inspiration from the 
Lazarillo, Rico states that the rich linguistic inventory and expressive power in the little 
book surpasses any effort made in the Representación, which accents the vulgarity of folk 
speech and exposes a lack of narrative imagination (Márquez Villanueva, “Sebastián de 
Horozco” 253-339; Anónimo ed. Rico 1987 and 2011).57 
Shortly after José María Asensio proposed Horozco, Morel-Fatio, based on the 
anticlerical tone of the little book, pointed towards the circle of humanists surrounding 
the Valdés brothers (Morel-Fatio, Recherches 164-166). From there, some decades later 
Manuel J. Asensio built his case in favor of the younger brother,58 the reformist Juan de 
Valdés, placing the writing of the Lazarillo near Escalona and Toledo around 1525 
(Asensio, La intención religiosa; Asensio, “El Lazarillo” 101-28). As Asensio himself 
defended, his prudent proposal never pretended to be a conclusive argument to justify the 
attribution, but rather a clue for others to follow. Joseph V. Ricapito took the lead on this 
matter when in 1976 he supported “a very risky hypothesis” (“una hipótesis 
arriesgadísima”) of the attribution of the Lazarillo to the older of the Valdés brother, 
Alfonso, chancellor and Royal Secretary of Indian Letters of Emperor Charles V. In 
Ricapito’s own words, if Alfonso de Valdés was not the author, “it had to be someone 
suchlike him and someone who belonged to the same intellectual circles” (“tuvo que ser 
                                                 
57 Among the supporters of Horozco after Villanueva, are worth mention Fernando González Ollé 
(“Interpretación”), Jaime Sánchez Romeralo (“Lázaro en Toledo” 189-202) and José Gómez-Menor 
Fuentes (“Nuevos datos” 247-285), who contributed with other interesting but circumstantial facts. 
58 Manuel Amores argued that the brothers might have been in fact identical twins (28).

alguien semejante a él y alguien que perteneciera a los mismos círculos intelectuales”) 
(Anónimo ed. Ricapito). More recently, after carefully editing the Diálogo de las cosas 
acaecidas en Roma (Dialogue of the things occurred in Rome) and the Diálogo de 
Mercurio y Carón (Dialogue of Mercury and Charon) –both apparently wrongly 
attributed to Juan de Valdés until the end of 19th-century and 1925, respectively–, Rosa 
Navarro Durán came into the discussion to also back up the candidacy of Alfonso de 
Valdés (Navarro Durán, Alfonso de Valdés). The Catalan philologist carried out a detailed 
study of the books that influenced the author of the Lazarillo, whoever that might be, and 
the readings that inspired Alfonso de Valdés in his works. Finding that both the 
Diálogos’s and our little book’s author shared the same literary roots, Navarro Durán 
concluded that the writers must have been the same person. The problem with this strong 
assumption is that it implies a very early date for the conception of the Lazarillo, as the 
older of the Valdés brothers died of the plague in Vienna in 1532. Conveniently, all the 
books that apparently served as source for Alfonso de Valdés in the writing of the 
Lazarillo were available before that date (works such as La Celestina [Tragicomedy of 
Calisto and Melibea] by Fernando de Rojas, the Propalladia by Torres Naharro, the 
anonymous Comedia Thebaida [Comedy called Thebasis], La lozana andaluza [The lusty 
Andalusian woman] by Francisco Delicado, or even the Relox de príncipes [Watch of 
Princes] by Antonio de Guevara). And when not, as Francisco Rico noted in relation to 
the Dichos graciosos de españoles (Funny sayings of Spaniards) collected by Chevalier 
or the Baldus by Folengo, Navarro Durán interprets it as the Lazarillo influencing other 
works, instead of being influenced by them (Navarro Durán, Lazarillo; “«Lazarillo de 
Tormes»“). 
As noted many times, the last paragraph of the prologue in the Lazarillo does not seem to 
correspond with the authorial voice present in the rest of the little book.59 Navarro 
defends that two different discourses can be identified: one coming from the author 
himself, and the other from Lázaro, the character, narrating “the case” (“el caso”) to 
“Your Grace” (“Vuestra Merced”). The philologist also points in the direction of a 
                                                 
59 Others argue that the prologue must be read in the last place, as a final treatise (Lázaro Carreter 134; 
Sieber).

supposedly disappeared folio that used to accompany all literary works in the 16th-
century, and that would split the prologue and the body, separating in practice the two 
distinct narratives. She imagines an Argumento (Argument) of erasmist nature articulated 
upon the secret of confession, in her opinion key for the correct understanding of the little 
book and she precisely defends that it was because of this that the page was torn off. 
Furthermore, and exhibiting a laudable creative dexterity, she proposes that “Vuestra 
Merced” is in fact a woman, who having confessed to the Archpriest of San Salvador, 
gets worried after discovering his amancebamiento (de facto relationship) with a 
maidservant married to no one less than a town crier of the wines of Toledo, our own 
Lázaro de Tormes, to whom “Vuestra Merced” asks for explaining the case and dispel 
her doubts (Navarro Durán, “El caso” 3-9; La verdad). While this adds little to the 
question of the author, her reflections resonated with some scholars who encumbered her 
at the peak of erudition.60 Others carried out studies dismantling every aspect of her 
theory. Despite the efforts of the Catalan framing the Lazarillo as erasmist to harmonize 
with the style of Alfonso de Valdés, and the recent support in 2010 by the pioneer of the 
attribution (Ricapito, “Further Comments” 95) –possibly aimed by the popularity reaped 
by Navarro Durán–, there are still strong reasons against Valdés. To cite a few: the lack 
of solid linguistic concordances, the difference in style and genre (Alfonso de Valdés 
wrote mostly theological works), the aforementioned gap between the writing date and 
the first known editions of 1554, and the fact that the second part of the little book (which 
Navarro grants to Hurtado de Mendoza) starts with Lázaro enrolled to the war in Argel in 
1541.61 
At the beginning of the 20th-century, Fonger de Haan related the existence in 1538 of a 
town crier of Toledo named Lope de Rueda. Julio Cejador y Frauca accounts for the fact 
and, as part of his arguments in favour of Sebastián de Horozco, rejects what he 
considered to be a weak proposal for the authorship of the Lazarillo (Anónimo ed. 
                                                 
60 In favor we can mention Juan Goytisolo (sec. 26). 
61 Against the thesis of Navarro Durán notable works include Alatorre (Los denigradores; “El Lazarillo” 
143-51), Féliz Carrasco (“Lazarillo” 9; “¿Errata o lectio difficilior?” 23), Francisco Márquez Villanueva 
(“El Lazarillo y sus autores” 137), Valentín Pérez Vénzalá (“El Lazarillo” 46), Marco Antonio Ramírez 
López (“Fortunas” 43), Pedro Martín Baños (“Nuevos asedios” 2).

Cejador y Frauca). The discovery led Fred Abrams to believe that the town crier was in 
fact the Sevillian actor and author of entremeses, Lope de Rueda. Analyzing the thematic 
and stylistic similarities as well as the concordances between the little book and the plays 
by Lope de Rueda, the American suggested that the actor could be the wanted author 
(Abrams, 67). However, a later study on town criers by Jaime Sánchez Romeralo 
revealed that the Lope de Rueda from Toledo and the author of plays were different 
persons, which was considered by Rico as the final piece of evidence to stop supporting 
the candidacy of the playwright. Years later Alfredo Baras Escolá still defended the 
similarities between the works of the Sevillian Lope de Rueda and the Lazarillo, based on 
the “eleven motifs or situations usually employed by the dramatist Lope de Rueda and 
that happen with precision in the novel [i.e., the Lazarillo] in the form of sequences” 
(“once motivos o situaciones a que suele recurrir Lope de Rueda dramaturgo y que se 
cumplen con exactitud en la novela incluso en forma de secuencias”) (Sánchez Romeralo, 
“De Lope de Rueda” 671-675; Baras Escolá, “Lazarillo y su autor” 6), but with the 
scholar having failed to express them clearly, no one seems to have supported the actor’s 
authorship ever since. Rico vehemently rejects the hypothesis: “the same alleged reasons 
that later on would be used in defense of this idea lead to discard them without 
hesitation” (“las mismas pretendidas razones que posteriormente se han querido alegar en 
defensa de tal idea inducen a descartarla sin vacilaciones”) (Anónimo ed. Rico, 40). 
During the second part of the 20th-century other names were proposed although none of 
them enjoyed enough support afterwards. In 1955, based on the idea of the author being a 
recognized intellectual and humanist in Spain at the time, Arturo Marasso raised the 
possibility of the professor and latinist Pedro de Rhúa (Marasso, 74). His argument was 
based on an alleged aversion between Pedro de Rhúa and Friar Antonio de Guevara. In 
that sense, the Lazarillo would merely be a parody of Guevara’s style, in particular of his 
Epístolas familiares (Family epistoles). The Argentinian also highlighted the erasmist 
and knowledgeable tone used by de Rhúa in his letters. The criticism against Antonio de 
Guevara is somewhat similar to the general indictment towards the clergy from Soria that 
can be found in the Diálogos de Mercurio y Carón (Corencia Cruz). To this respect, 
Fernando Calero contributed supporting the candidacy of de Rhúa as the author with a 
rather particular approach (Calero Calero, “Homenaje” 26): 
101 
 
 
What a sharp nose Marasso had! Because the hidden author of the Lazarillo was 
indeed the Bachiller Rhúa. [...] It seems highly significant that in all Spanish 
literature [the expression “lana caprina” (goat wool)] was only used in the 
Letters of Rhúa, and from there the concordance with Vives [in regards to his De 
concordia et discordia in humano genere] gained an incontrovertible evidential 
value. If we join this concordance to the other previous two, there is no shadow of 
a doubt that Rhúa and Vives are the same person. 
(¡Qué fino olfato literario tuvo Marasso! Porque, efectivamente, el oculto autor 
del Lazarillo fue el Bachiller Rhúa. […] Resulta altamente significativo que en 
toda la literatura española sólo sea utilizada [la expresión ‘lana caprina’] en las 
Cartas de Rhúa, y de ahí que la concordancia con Vives [en su De concordia et 
discordia in humano genere] adquiera un valor probatorio incontrovertible. Si 
unimos esta concordancia a las dos anteriores, no puede caber la más mínima 
duda de que Rhúa y Vives son la misma persona) (qtd. in Sánchez Ferrer, Los 
padres). 
Aldo Ruffinato also found Brenes’ hypothesis to be evocative and compelling.62 
Unfortunately, the profile of the author drawn by Marasso lacks bibliographical support 
and factual certainties to rely on. 
In his 1964 essay on the interpretation and attribution of Lazarillo, Aristide Rumeau 
proposed the latinist Hernán Núñez de Toledo as the author (Rumeau). His comparison 
between the little book and Las trescientas del famosísimo poeta Juan de Mena con glosa 
(The three hundred of the universally known poet Juan de Mena with glosa) by the 
disciple of Nebrija, relied on linguistic and tone similarities, although these were not 
compelling enough to raise the support of other scholars. Not a stronger candidate is 
Fernando de Rojas, proposed by Howard Mancing in 1976. The American researcher 
based his hypothesis on the ability of the alledge author of La Celestina to criticize the 
social establishment, and on his nature of converso (convert), which supposedly granted 
                                                 
62 In his Introduction of his edition of the Lazarillo. 
102 
 
 
him an agnostic or anti-clergy background to write the Lazarillo (Mancing, 47-61). The 
Royal Secretary Gonzalo Pérez was also proposed by Dalai Brenes Carrillo in a series of 
studies started in 1986. Brenes interprets that the translator of La Vlixea de Homero (The 
Odyssey of Homer) wrote the little book as a sort of roman à clef about the life in the 
court of Charles V, where Laźaro is a “combined anti-thesis of the young Telemachus 
and the astute Ulysses of the gimmicks” (“combinada antítesis del joven Telémaco y el 
astuto Ulises de las tretas.”) (Brenes Carrillo, “Lazarillo” 43; “Vlixea” 104). In the 
process, Brenes identifies the addressee of “V.M.” as “Vuestra Majestad” (Your 
Majesty), and establishes other parallels between characters of the little book and real 
ones surrounding the milieu of the Emperor (Hurtado de Mendoza, Fernando de los 
Cobos, Gattinara, Enciso, Sílice, etc.) (Brenes Carrillo, “¿Quién es V.M.?” 73-88).63 
Other minor attributions, at least in terms of supporters and evidence, include the 
dramatist Bartolomé Torres Naharro, author of La Propalladia, who, according to 
Alberto M. Forcadas, shares certain similarities with the Lazarillo (Forcadas, 48). 
Furthermore, suggested for the first time by Cejador (Anónimo ed. Cejador y Fracuca), 
Juan Maldonado was more recently supported by Clark Colahan and Alfred Rodríguez in 
1995. Arguing that although the humanist and friend of Erasmo only wrote in Latin, the 
little book presented several thematic and stylistic correspondences, supported by the 
common style used by Maldonado, i.e., the autobiographical monologue.64  
Almost all previous candidates were rejected in 2003 by Francisco Calero, who staunchly 
defended Juan Luis Vives, the illustrious Valencian pedagogue and philosopher, as the 
author of the little book. Despite his thorough analysis of up to 151 (sic) thematic, 
stylistic, and linguistic concordances, more than enough to incontrovertibly settle the 
problem once and for all –in Calero’s words–, the candidacy still does not feel 
sufficiently strong. Drawing on the work of other lazarillistas, the philologist seems to 
arbitrarily use the arguments that could benefit his thesis while rejecting those that do 
                                                 
63 Curiously, in his Un par de vueltas más, 2011, Agulló claimed that “V.M.” was in fact referring to 
Gonzalo Pérez himself. 
64 See Colahan and Rodríguez (289-311), and to a lesser extent Warren Smith, Clark Colahan, and Alfred 
Rodríguez (160-234).

not, e.g., “[Américo Castro] previously defended the Jew origin of Luis Vives. It is true 
that he did not propose him as the author of the Lazarillo, but it is also true that he was in 
the right direction” (“Al igual que en los casos citados, también acertó en este A. Castro, 
quien con anterioridad había defendido el origen judío de Luis Vives. Es cierto que no 
llegó a postularlo como autor del Lazarillo, pero también lo es que estaba en la dirección 
correcta”) (Calero, “Luis Vives”; Juan Luis Vives, autor 46). Besides the concordances, 
Calero’s arguments rely on the conviction that the erasmist also wrote in the Castilian 
language, although Vives was known and laureated for his Latin works in several and 
complex matters such as hunger, poverty, charity, mercy, spirituality, or morality. In 
order to further support his claims, Calero builds on Ricapito’s arguments to sustain 
Alfonso de Valdés’ authorship and twisted them to favour his candidate (Calero, 
“Homenaje” 65). Likewise, he supports Navarro Durán’s thesis in one important aspect: 
the author of the Diálogo de las cosas acaecidas en Roma and Diálogo de Mercurio y 
Carón must be the author of the Lazarillo. Coincidentally, Calero has published several 
works that allegedly demonstrate that the Diálogos, together with other important works 
of the time, were all written by Juan Luis Vives. In his zeal, the philologist passes over 
the inquisitorial documental proof referred to by Bataillon that attributes both the 
Diálogos to Alfonso de Valdés. And while we acknowledge the similarities between the 
Diálogos and the Lazarillo, the topics and expressions alluded by Calero to defend his 
thesis as unequivocal were actually platitudes among the intellectual circles at the time. 
The early dead of the forefather of modern psychology in 1540 does not help in either 
case. More recently the attribution to Vives was supported by Marco Antonio Coronel 
Ramos in 2012, without really adding much (81), and criticized again in 2014 in a review 
of Calero’s theory by Encarna Podadera, editor of a critical edition of the second part of 
the little book (13-24). 
The 21st Century also brought the first authorship attributions complemented and 
supported by computational means. In order to delimit the profile of the author, in 2003 
José Luis Madrigal drew his attention to the circle of intellectuals surrounding Alejo de 
104 
 
 
Venegas.65 The grammarian from Toledo wrote Las diferencias de libros que ay en el 
Universo (The different books existing in the Universe) in which the “libro racional” 
(“rational book”) covers the topic of poverty with influences from Erasmo’s Moria and a 
general tone inspired by Apuleyo’s Asno de oro (The Golden Ass). The evident erasmist 
point of view inspired Madrigal to conclude that the author of the little book had to be a 
disciple of Venegas, and if not from Toledo at least a great connoisseur of the place. 
After discarding other authors of the same environment, Madrigal found in Francisco 
Cervantes de Salazar the candidate that fitted the profile (“Estudio de atribución” 9-13; 
“Cervantes de Salazar” 3). Translator of Juan Luis Vives, Fernán Pérez de Oliva, and 
Luis Mejía among others, Cervantes de Salazar moved to Mexico possibly inspired by the 
opportunity to found the Pontifical University of Mexico. There he started to sign his 
works with the Latin version of his name, Franciscus Cervantes Salazarus, in which 
Madrigal believed to find an anagram with the name Lázaro (saLAZARUS ~ LAZARO) 
that would prove the authorship, albeit recognizing himself that “attributions based in 
possible anagrams usually have the same credibility that the prophecies of Nostradamus” 
(“Las atribuciones basadas en posibles anagramas suelen tener normalmente la misma 
credibilidad que las profecías de Nostradamus”) (Madrigal, Autor del Lazarillo). To 
further support his candidate and his circumstantial evidence, Madrigal tried to identify 
what he called the modus scribendi of the author, a sort of fingerprint that comprises the 
set of features that supposedly defines the style of an author univocally. From the 
electronic versions of texts available in repositories such as CORDE,66 and using as 
discriminator the coincidences between the Lazarillo and Cervantes de Salazar’s Crónica 
de Nueva España (Chronicle of New Spain), Madrigal built a method upon four 
opinionated levels of similarity (groups of words, idioms, peculiar syntactic turns, and 
other complex syntactic constructions). After applying his technique to other 
contemporary works to see which ones kept the highest number of similarities, Cervantes 
de Salazar’s works were stylistically closer to the Lazarillo that any other work. During 
the process Madrigal acknowledged he had not used more modern and current 
                                                 
65 Vaguely proposed as well by Ruffinatto (“Lázaro González Pérez” 3).

105 
 
 
approaches to authorship attribution, which weakens the credibility of his proposal 
although not of his methodology. In fact, five years later, with more evidence and slightly 
improved methods, Madrigal was forced to abandon the candidacy of the Toledan and 
welcome the jurist Juan Arce de Otálora, author of the Coloquios de Palatino y Pinciano 
(Colloquia of Palatino and Pinciano) (Madrigal, “Notas” 137-236). The palinode, 
strongly criticized by scholars such as Francisco Calero (“Los Coloquios” 65), 
downplayed the issue arguing that during the research, the corpus he had access to was 
limited, and that he realized that the author did not necessarily need to be a member of 
the chosen corpus –a problem usually referred to as the open-set problem and that 
characterizes the attribution of the Lazarillo. Nevertheless, Madrigal continued to employ 
keywords in context (KWIC) concordances to further support Arce de Otálora’s 
candidacy, insisting as well on another anagram he found (“LAZARO DE TOR(M) (E)S 
ARZE DE OTALOR”), and the suggestive coincidence between Lázaro’s surnames 
(González Pérez) and Arce de Otálora’s grandparents surnames (Fernand González and 
Juan Pérez).67 In the same year of 2010, Alfredo Rodríguez López-Vázquez supported 
and rejected the candidacy of the author of the Coloquios, to later propose Friar Juan de 
Pineda (“El Tractado” 259-72; “Una refutación” 313-34). His theory was based on the 
same statistical methods and biographical similarities used by Madrigal, and followed the 
lead left by José Luis Ocasar, who edited the Coloquios some years before and in a later 
study did not confirm nor deny Arce de Otálora as the author (Ocasar, 873-888). 
Inspired by Madrigal and Rodríguez López-Vázquez, and by means of his genetic-literary 
approach,68 Ocasar mentioned a possible collaboration in the little book by Friar Juan de 
Pineda. The editor of Otálora’s Coloquios highlighted that way the alleged important role 
of the multiple authorship around the mid 16th-century, previous to the strict rules 
imposed by the Church in terms of the signing of books, and raised the possibility of 
Lazarillo being the product of the collaboration between several authors. Although the 
                                                 
67 In the Hispanic tradition is habitual that people have two surnames, the first coming from the first 
surname of the father, and the second from the first of the mother (Madrigal, “De nombres y lugares” 89-
118). 
68 Roughly, a genetic-literary analysis is the study of the differences and similarities between the editions of 
a text.

analysis of multiple authorship may be increasing in importance and interest in recent 
years it was once considered a sort of joke, as gathered by Francisco Rico in relation to 
Francisco de Avellaneda’s 1675 famous Loa por papeles (Loa for the papers):69 
I do not ignore that Thou knows, 
as [Thou] nothing ignores, 
that the Lazarillo de Tormes 
six lads, just like that, 
wrote in two days, 
as that is the utter count. 
(No ignoro que Vos sabéis, 
puesto que nada ignoráis, 
que al Lazarillo de Tormes 
seis mozos, sin más ni más, 
escribieron en dos días, 
que esta es la cuenta cabal). 
At this side of the spectrum at which the author is belittled in favour of the many 
interpretations and meanings that the anonymity has to offer, some scholars such as 
Robert Fiore consider the authorship of the little book vital for its understanding: “the 
author, who undoubtedly wished to remain anonymous, has had his wishes fulfilled. Not 
only does the author remain unknown today, but his narrator is obscured, and his point of 
view is so shrouded by irony that it is not obvious to readers and critics” (Anónimo ed. 
Fiore, 714). In the same line, Américo Castro suggests that the anonymity of the 
Lazarillo is an essential part of the text itself:70 
We should realize, however, that this anonymity is not an accident, nor an 
omission, but an essential aspect of the literary reality of the book. If we take the 
                                                 
69 Rico’s Lazarillo (115-128), where he also gathers the attribution made by Dr. Locker, Dean of 
Peterborough, to a group of Spanish bishops traveling to the Council of Trent. 
70 See Américo Castro’s introduction in Williams Harry Franklin and Hesse Everett Wesley. 
107 
 
 
fact of this anonymity as a point of departure, we may penetrate the book more 
deeply and enjoy it better than through mere appeasement of our curiosity about 
the author’s name. 
In his latest edition of the Lazarillo to date, and after thoroughly discrediting all other 
candidates, Francisco Rico takes for certain that the author was indeed a man named 
“Lázaro de Tormes”. In order to argument in favor of the apocryphal character of the 
book, Rico maintains that the game-changer aspect of the Lazarillo was a new kind of 
fiction, one that the audience was not yet ready to experience: “readers faced the book as 
pure ‘truth’ and ended up finding a ‘lie’ that established an admirably new genre of 
‘fiction’” (“los lectores acometían el libro como pura ‘verdad’ y acababan encontrando 
una ‘mentira’ que instauraba un género de ‘ficción’ admirablemente nuevo”) (Anónimo 
ed. Rico, 115-128). According to Rico, not all readers were capable or in a position to 
decypher the fictionality introduced in the Lazarillo. This same complexity, together with 
the structural necessity of the author for anonymity, also led Fernando Rodriguez 
Mansilla to think about the author as an undercover moralist, not as a professional writer, 
who only wrote one little book in his entire life (Rodriguez Mansilla 235). We have a 
precedence in Fernando de Rojas’ La Celestina. If this were true, as Rico points out, any 
internal analysis of the little book would have been futile. Therefore, we will work from 
the assumption that its true author, as slippery and elusive as he may seem, wrote more 
than only one book, even if that were a masterpiece such as the Lazarillo. 
According to the aforementioned list of the most frequently proposed authors, we have 
created a table that summarizes the candidates in terms of support by scholars and sorted 
by year of contribution (see table 1), as well as a chronology of the candidates, when they 
were proposed, by whom, who criticized them, and when they were criticized (see also 
table S1 in the supplementary materials, henceforth: SM).71 
                                                 
71 Good summaries can be found in Rico’s 2011 edition, and Joaquín Corencia Cruz. Rico’s 2011 edition is 
not included in this table as he basically discredited all the authors ever proposed. He stays neutral while 
the same edition reads “«Lázaro de Tormes»” as the author.

4.3 Beyond Concordances 
The analysis of texts sits at the core of the humanities. Identifying writing styles and the 
authors of anonymous or wrongly attributed texts has been of interest to scholars at least 
since the invention of the printing press, when the availability of and access to texts 
fostered comparative studies.73 Text attribution studies fall into two different categories 
                                                 
73 See an introduction to the topic by Harold Love.

attending to the nature of the evidence used. Internal analysis deals with the ways in 
which language is employed, from syntactic occurrences to the use of expressions that are 
characteristic of a specific author, or stemmatics based on Lachmannian textual criticism. 
The purpose of the internal analysis is to find the fingerprints of the author, and in the 
process it assumes that each author maintains a modus scribendi –as Madrigal called it– 
that is characteristic of each author. On the other hand, external analysis focuses on the 
circumstances of the author and how they are reflected in the text. It tries to create a 
profile of the anonymous writer by looking into readings that influenced the text, the kind 
of content expressed, and even by tracing parallels between events told in the text and the 
real life events of the author. Historiography, hermeneutics and rhetorics are big parts of 
the external analysis. Most non-traditional authorship attribution studies, in opposition to 
those run by the domain experts, rely on the internal analysis of the texts in hand, and 
therefore assume some existence of a quantifiable individual’s writing style. 
Although authorship studies and their quantitative approaches predate computing, the 
introduction of computers made it easier and more affordable to analyze internal 
characteristics of texts and whole corpora (Love; Lord, 282; Mendenhall, 97-105). The 
successful attribution made by Frederick Mosteller and David Wallace of the essays in 
The Federalist marked the start of modern authorship techniques powered by computers. 
Their method was based on the statistical analysis of a set of predefined characteristics –
usually a list of words– known as style markers: features outside the conscious control of 
the writer that were supposed to quantify the writing style. Over time other features were 
added, such as sentence length, vocabulary richness, magic indices (such as the widely 
used Yule’s Characteristic or Simpson’s Index), hapaxes, character frequencies, and all 
sort of ratios.74 However, the case of the The Federalist has been considered not to be a 
good representative of the larger problem of non-traditional authorship studies: Mosteller 
and Wallace had a very well delimited problem with a clear set of possible candidates 
and certainty about one of them being indeed the author. Criticism started to flourish after 
a period of popularity during which the results of authorship attribution techniques were 
                                                 
74 All these old techniques are very well explained in David I. Holmes (“Authorship attribution” 87-106). 
113 
 
 
even accepted at courts as experts’ evidence.75 Richard Bailey was the first to identify the 
necessary circumstances for authorship attribution in a forensic setting (1-20). More 
recently Efstathios Stamatos considered (and extended) those as limitations of the 
techniques when faced with real life authorship attribution cases: long textual data of 
possibly very dissimilar styles, small candidate sets with 2 or 3 members, corpora not 
controlled by topic, and lack of objective evaluation criteria or benchmark data to assess 
the goodness of the methods (“A survey” 56). These flaws would be mostly overcome 
from the 1990s onwards, when electronic texts became pervasive and machines started to 
be powerful enough to process large volumes of data. In turn, these advances made 
possible the development and maturation of disciplines such as information retrieval, 
machine learning, and natural language processing (NLP), from where authorship studies 
have borrowed and applied some of the methods (Stamatatos, “A survey” 56). 
Other aspects also affect the credibility and accuracy of computer-based methods. There 
is evidence of language affecting the reliability of these techniques, mostly focused in 
English texts since its beginning, although some language-independent methods of 
attribution have later appeared as part of computational linguistics (Peng et al., 267-274). 
Efforts in the field have been put in place to test methods in language-specific corpora 
and cross-language settings with encouraging results (Stamatatos et al. “Overview”). 
Javier Blasco and Cristina Ruiz Urbón highlighted the importance of the language and 
the proper choice of features when applied to Spanish texts. Albeit their study focused on 
modern Spanish texts extracted from online newspapers and blogs, they still mention the 
controversy surrounding the Lazarillo and noted the peculiarities of dealing with Spanish 
Golden Age works. 
In general terms, modern authorship attribution problems fall in different categories 
depending on the desired outcome and the corpus. The process of discovering how alike 
two given texts are and finding their similarities is usually known as plagiarism detection 
(Stein, Lipka, and Prettenhofer, 63-82; Stein and zu Eissen; Zu Eissen and Benno Stein, 
                                                 
75 Such is the case for CUSUM (QSUM) by Andrew Morton and Sidney Michaelson, strongly criticized by 
David Holmes and Fiona Tweedie (19-47). 
114 
 
 
565-569).76 When the corpus is not available, researchers try to cluster authors, a 
technique that divides up the texts into parts that maintain the same style in order to 
discern authorship in collaborative works, which makes it possible to show the evolution 
of an author’s style over time (Collins et al. 15-36; Graham, Hirst, and Marthi, 397-415). 
In some cases, it is even possible to characterize the profile of authors in terms of age, 
education, etc. by means of their writing (Koppel, Argamon, and Shimoni; Rangel et al.). 
While these approaches might some day be useful when applied to the Lazarillo, 
unfortunately they are still in their infancy. On the other hand, authorship identification 
counts with a more solid and dilated history, both in terms of research published and 
success cases. It is defined generally as the task of determining the unknown author of a 
given text from a set of candidates whose texts’ authorships are generally accepted. 
Unlike closed-set attribution identification problems where the authors involved are 
known and the only task remaining is to identify who wrote what, Lazarillo turns out to 
be an open-set problem, where new authors are still being added to the pool of 
candidates. Open-set problems are considered much more difficult to dilucidate as there 
is no guarantee that the true author is part of the pool of candidates, especially when its 
size is small (Koppel, Schler, and Argamon, 83-94). Author verification, the problem of 
authorship identification with a set of one only candidate, is even more challenging since 
the task is to determine if the candidate is the author or not (Koppel and Schler). Among 
the different approaches for authorship identification, some scholars treat the problem as 
a set of instances of author verification, one per each author in the candidate set (Craig). 
According to Hugh Craig, non-traditional authorship attribution studies lay their 
foundation on the idea of writers being constrained by their own cognitive faculties, 
resulting in a finite and statistically analyzable set of variation patterns that form their 
style (Craig). As it appears, authors cannot escape their style, not even when writing in 
different genres since “much of language production is done by parts of the brain which 
act in such swift and complex ways that they can be called a true linguistic 
                                                 
76  An interesting introduction and approach can be found in Marilyn Randall.

unconscious.”77 As tenable as they seem, style markers do not convey the power of 
conviction that traditional humanities scholars consider sufficient. The black-box, or yes-
or-no approaches most computer-based authorship studies follow do not provide the 
stylistic explanation expected by the experts. Computational approaches to authorship 
attribution, and thus to authorship identification and verification, are not considered 
sufficient evidence to state the final truth in the dispute of anonymous texts. However, as 
we demonstrate in this study, using automatic authorship attribution might help reduce 
the pool of candidates and contribute evidence to further support a specific possible 
author or set of authors. 
4.4 Materials 
One big problem of computational methods is that they usually require the availability of 
digital editions of the texts, and it has been proven that some of the methods work better 
when their extensions are at the level of entire books. These kinds of collections exist but 
they do not usually grant access to the whole text;78 therefore, in order to carry out our 
study, we were forced to collect our own corpus. We decided our corpus to comprise 
works in a period of 90 years surrounding the publication of the first known edition of the 
Lazarillo. All the major aforementioned candidates for the authorship of the little book 
are included, as well as some authors who had not been considered previously. The 
inclusion of these other authors is not coincidental: they add robustness to our method 
and establish a framework to assess its effectivity. We consider the period from 1499 to 
1589 to be comprehensive enough to cover the nuances of all possible publication dates, 
lifespans and active period of authors. This span is even more generous if we take for 
granted the genetic-literary analysis by Ocasar (La atribución), who allegedly found the 
first citation to the Lazarillo in the early editions of Coloquios de Palatino y Pinciano, 
published in 1550.79 
                                                 
77 Citing from Craig, in relation to Mary Thomas Crane. 
78 CORDE, for example, only allows counting frequencies. 
79 Fernando Calero dates these Coloquios even sooner, around 1539 (Calero, Los Coloquios). 
116 
 
 
Collecting a dataset of the kind described was not an easy task. Some of the works are 
still in manuscript form and lack normalization, modernization, and digitized text, which 
makes the task even more monstrous. Digitization of original Spanish Golden Age 
manuscripts also presented some challenges, which we solved by building and using our 
own crowdsourcing OCR reviewing tool, i.e., Festos.80 Object character recognition 
(OCR) is the process of transforming an image of a text into its digital version readable 
by both people and machines. We built Festos upon DocumentCloud,81 a platform for 
journalists to collaboratively share and annotate documents, and Tesseract (Smith, 629-
633), a state-of-the-art OCR tool open sourced by Google. While Tesseract is pluggable 
(Smith, Antonova, and Lee), it still lacks a good understanding of manuscript typefaces 
and old Spanish. These limitations were overcome by adding a reviewing tool in Festos 
that allowed collaborators to correct and proofread the results of the automatic 
recognition. This reviewing feature sped up the process of getting the digital texts ready 
as compared to the approach of transcriptions from scratch. 
Unfortunately, although some works were already in digital form and others had modern 
usable editions, due to resources and time constraints we were unable to collect works 
from all the authors proposed and mentioned in this study as possible fathers of the 
Lazarillo. Pedro de Rhúa and Hernán Núñez de Toledo are among the authors without 
representation in our list of works, although this might not pose a great burden on our 
study since they were arguably the weakest of the candidates: not supported ever since 
they were first proposed in 1955 and 1964, respectively. Friars Juan de Pineda and Juan 
de Ortega, the first and last candidates to date to be proposed, are the other two authors 
not present in our corpus. The former has not been backed up yet by any other scholar, 
the latter does not count with any known work that could be used. The final list of works 
by authors in the pool of candidates analyzed is detailed below:82

The corpus counts a total of 50 works by different authors of different genres, styles, and 
extensions.83 Regarding Lazarillo itself, we used the edition of the Centro Virtual 
Cervantes, which is a digital edition based on those published in 1554 in Burgos (Spain) 
by Juan de Junta, Alcalá de Henares (Spain) by Salzedo, Antwerp (Belgium) by Martín 
Nucio, and Medina del Campo (Spain) by Mateo and Francisco del Canto. The edition, 
also collated with the critical works by Alberto Blecua, José M. Caso González, and 
Francisco Rico (Anónimo ed. Blecua; Anónimo ed. Caso González; Anónimo ed. Rico), 
marks visually the interpolations that the edition of Alcalá added. There is some 
controversy around deciding whether those additions should be considered as apocryphal, 
or as coming from the same author and therefore part of the princeps. In this context, and 
aiming to improve the accuracy of our method by only having works written by the same

Lazarillo de Tormes and of his fortunes and adversities), published in 1555 in Antwerp 
by the printer Martín Nucio. Digitally edited by Centro Virtual Cervantes, it takes into

4.5 Methods 
In the presentation of their automated tool (JGAAP) Patrick Juola, John Sofko, and 
Patrick Brennan stated that “all known human languages can be described as an 
unbounded sequence chosen from a finite space of possible events.” These events might 
range from the different words of a language such as Spanish, to the letters of a specific 
alphabet, or the different phonemes in the spoken inventory; as such, any written book 
meets the definition. They also considered that, generally, almost any non-traditional 
authorship attribution analysis –and, thus, author identification– can be seen as a three-
phases pipeline, each of which must be tailored to the specific needs of the corpus and 
task at hand (Juola, Sofko, and Brennan). We adopted their framework for its broad and 
comprehensive view and redefined the steps for our purposes. The first one, 
                                                 
84 Unfortunately, the interpolations are not long enough to be included in the authorship attribution study. 
Possible workarounds for this issue are discussed in the conclusions and further research of this study. 
120 
 
 
canonicalization,85 is the process of standardizing the events in the text in order to reduce 
the complexity and thus the number of different symbols and words to handle. The rules 
we followed for regularizing the spelling of old Spanish were borrowed from Ocasar’s 
system in his edition of the Coloquios de Palatino y Pinciano by Arce de Otálora 
(Ocasar, La atribución), to which we added some of our own. Specifically, we removed 
margin annotations and footnotes; removed page headers, footers, and numbers; removed 
any Latin or Greek citations; joined split words; removed spurious characters; removed 
duplicated punctuation marks; converted all possible hyphens into one; removed numbers 
in text as they usually add little to the style; expanded abbreviations such as “Đ” into the 
canonical form “DE;” and removed starting and ending marks of chapters, volumes, 
parts, scenes, and books. For plays, we also removed names of speakers. Then the event 
set had to be determined, which includes the partitioning of the works in the corpus into 
nonoverlapping events, such as paragraphs, sentences or words. The last step was the 
application of different kinds of statistical inferences to said events, from basic 
frequencies and distance-based measures to machine learning and pattern-based 
techniques. The specific features to be extracted depend on the statistical analysis to be 
carried out. This process can be seen as a transformation of the text into numbers, an 
ultimate quantification that produces vectors from stories attending to a variety of 
criteria: a corpus is now transformed into a more general and abstract dataset. The main 
goal of any feature extraction step is to maximize the discriminative power of the feature 
set selected, that may contain different kinds of features. Efstathios Stamatatos classifies 
the features in 5 groups, according to their nature and role in the text, and each requiring 
different mechanisms for their obtention (see table 2). Lexical and character features are 
historically the first ones to be used, and deal with the text at the word and letter levels, 
respectively. Frequency distributions of words or characters (bag of words), or ordered 
sets of them of different lengths (n-grams) are among the most used lexical features and 
the ones that provide best results. Although they are very useful since they can be applied 
regardless of the language, the extraction of lexical features might require the use of 
advanced techniques from natural language processing in order to segment the text into 
                                                 
85 “Canonicization” in the original text. 
121 
 
 
sentences or words –tokenizers, stemmers, and lemmatizers may come in handy. 
Extraction of semantic and syntactic features involves an even more sophisticated 
analysis of the texts, as it uses layers of knowledge that are not revealed in the text itself. 
These abstract constructs such as parts of speech, polysemy, or phrase structure, are 
related to a specific role of parts of the text. In practice, the extraction of this kind of 
features can be thought of as a two-step process: first, the text is transformed according to 
the function of its parts, and second, the same mechanism of counting the lexical features 
can then be used. 
Furthermore, Stamatatos also makes a distinction according to how the different methods 
of attribution treat the corpus. Profile-based approaches operate on a per-author basis, 
concatenating all texts by the same author and extracting the features cumulatively, 
ignoring in fact the possible existence of differences amongst their texts. Instance-based 
methods, on the other hand, treat each text individually and try to produce most accurate 
attribution models by considering the individual contributions that each of the texts 
makes to the authorial style. Generally, as a manner to artificially increase the number of 
texts available in the corpus, chunking the works into parts of equal sizes in terms of 
number of paragraphs, sentences, or words is a widely employed technique. Finally, there 
is a third approach that would combine both profile and instance-based methods. 
Regardless of the technique of attribution used, the selection of features and their size or 
dimensionality still remains a rather arbitrary and domain specific task.

4.5.1 Comprehension and Compression 
When faced with many features, dimensionality reduction and feature selection 
techniques can be applied (Forman), although they might fail to capture authors’ styles 
and therefore result in features too genre- or topic-dependent (Brank et al.). John 
Burrows, after experimenting with techniques based on multivariate analysis to reduce 
the dimensionality of the feature space, came up with an approach that fits perfectly in 
123 
 
 
Juola’s broad definition of an authorship attribution method: the ‘Delta’ method 
(Burrows, “Delta” 267-287; “Attribution and Beyond”). From a frequency distribution of 
the 150 most frequent words in a corpus, the method starts by estimating the mean 
frequency of the word and its variance, the so called z-distribution. Burrows’ ‘Delta’ 
(which he insisted it to be named ‘Δ’ where possible, although his claims were unheard) 
is then built as “the mean of the absolute differences between the z-scores for a set of 
word-variables in a given text-group and the z-scores for the same set of word-variables 
in a target text.” Which means that the smaller the Delta, the more similar the texts are. 
This profile-based method turned out to be the most robust single measure and it is now 
used as a baseline for other methods since it usually produces useful results across genres 
and languages. Some improvements have been proposed based on explanations of the 
underlying mathematics involved, but Burrows’ ‘Delta’ has proven over and over to 
perform better than its modifications despite lacking a solid theoretical background (Stein 
and Argamon, “A mathematical explanation” 207-209; Rybicki and Eder, “Deeper Delta” 
fqr031). 
Table 4-3: Best Deltas for our corpus. Each row shows a different setting for culling 
and most frequent words, the best performing Delta in each case, and the difference 
of means as defined by Jannidis as a proxy for best measure.

Fotis Jannidis recently proposed a framework based on a simple difference of means to 
evaluate and assess the ‘Delta’ method and its variations. The measure “showed the best 
correlation with the clustering error measure” when doing ingroup and outgroup 
comparisons –ingroup refers to distances between texts written by the same author, and 
outgroup by different authors. The larger the difference, the better the measure performs. 
They also published the code used to carry out their analysis –a practice that we believe 
should become more common–, which we used with slight modifications over our corpus 
of Lazarillo (Jannidis, et al.; Evert et al.). We executed several runs changing the number 
of most frequent words to consider (150, 500, 1000, 2500), and also applied different 
125 
 
 
culling factors (30%, 50%, 70%, 90%) based on David Hoover’s extensive analysis and 
variations over the original ‘Delta’ method.86 We obtained that Maciej Eder variation, a 
variant derived from the Canberra measure of similarity (Rybicki and Eder, Deeper 
Delta), performed sensibly better than baseline and than more sophisticated Deltas such 
as cosine-based or simpler ones such as the Euclidean (see table 3 for a summary of the 
executions). This might be explained by the fact that Eder’s Delta seems to provide better 
results for highly inflected languages, and although only tested for French, it might work 
as well for Spanish (Eder and Rybicki, “Birds of a feather” fqs036; Eder, “Does size 
matter?” 132-135).

arborean grouping by similarity measured by the chosen Delta distance. Eder 
simple Delta is calculated with 0% of culling and for the 150 most frequent words. 
Same authors are assigned the same color. 
                                                 
86 Culling is the percentage of documents a word must appear in to be retained in the corpus (Hoover, 
“Delta prime?” 477-495; “Testing Burrows's delta” 453-475). 
126 
 
 
 
Figure 4-3: Dendrograms for Cosine Delta. Cosine Delta is calculated for the 2500 
most frequent words and with 0% of culling. Same authors are assigned the same 
color. 
Figures 2 and 3 show dendrograms that put into a hierarchy the works in our corpus by 
means of the Delta measure. Works in leaves with the same parent are closer to each 
other that to those works in leaves accessible only by traversing the tree. Following the 
arborean structure Jannidis’ algorithm produces, it is easy to see how some of the 
candidates just stay out of the branch that reaches to the Lazarillo. The method 
consistently leaves authors such as Fernán Pérez de Oliva, Fernando de Rojas, Francisco 
Delicado, or Juan de Malara far from our wanted anonymous author. As a first approach 
it goes with our intuitions as they were impostors in our corpus. However, authors with 
strong candidacies are also grouped differently than the Lazarillo, as it is the case of Juan 
Luis Vives, Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, Juan Valdés or even Lope de Rueda. Among the 
ones more closely related to the author of the Lazarillo, with or without interpolaciones, 
we find Juan Arce de Otálora and Alfonso de Valdés, but unexpected authors such as 
127 
 
 
Cristóbal de Villalón or Pedro Mejía. The second part of the adventure of Lázaro de 
Tormes is also placed together with the first two. According to the inventor of the Delta 
method, this result suggests that we should focus on these last group of authors and 
reinterpret the authorship of the little book as a closed-set problem. In relation to the 
dependence of the method on probabilities, Hoover observed that with specific cases of 
corpora “false attributions are a serious possibility” (Hoover, Testing), and Burrows also 
noted that “the system for distinguishing between insiders and outsiders is not foolproof” 
(Burrows, ‘Delta’). The problem worsens when dealing with either texts of different 
lengths, or with a different number of texts by author –the class imbalance problem–, as it 
is our case.87 Therefore, before making a hasty decision, we had better explore other 
methods for authorship to further support this initial findings. 
Another set of distance-based methods borrows some concepts from the principles that 
make regular file compression applications work. Their functioning is similar to other 
probabilistic distance measures such as those based on Markov models (Khmelev and 
Tweedie, “Using Markov” 299-307; Kukushkina, Polikarpov, and Khmelev, “Using 
literal” 172-84),88 but avoids the combinatorial explosion problem when facing huge 
vocabulary sizes. In general, as compression methods are usually, but not necessarily, 
profile-based approaches, the first step is to concatenate all the works by an author to 
later compress them into individual files. The anonymous text is then added to the 
concatenated files and they are compressed again. The bitwise difference between the 
concatenated text files with and without the anonymous text is a measure of the similarity 
of both texts and can be used as a proxy for authorship attribution. Technically, from an 
information theory perspective, compression methods calculate the cross-entropy or 
Kullback-Leibler divergence of the texts as a measure of closeness.89 Fortunately, despite 
                                                 
87 Other distance-based methods, such as Common n-Grams (CNG) approach by Keselj et al. are also 
known to perform poorly under such circumstances (Kešelj et al.; Stamatatos, “Author identification” 237-
241). 
88 A good introduction to the topic with applications and examples can be found in Ming Li and Paul 
Vitnyi.

the mathematical complexity of this measure, the underlying idea is so easy to grasp that 
we could bypass the formulas by using virtually any compression tool available. In this 
scenario, the RAR compression format has shown to outperform any other, specially 
dictionary-based compression such as LZMA or GZIP (Khmelev and Teahan, “A 
repetition” 104-110; Marton, Wu, and Hellerstein, 300-314).  
In this context we used a technique implemented in 2005 by Rudi Cilibrasi and Paul 
Vitanyi around BZIP2, another very popular, free, and open source compression format 
(45). Let C(x) be the bitwise size of the compression of a text file x, and let denote 
concatenation of files x and y as x+y. Cilibrasi and Vitanyi built upon the concept of 
Kolmogorov complexity and defined their normalized compression distance (NCD) 
between the files x and y as follows:90 
𝑁𝐶𝐷(𝑥, 𝑦) =
𝐶(𝑥 + 𝑦) − 𝑚𝑖𝑛(𝐶(𝑥),𝐶(𝑦))
𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝐶(𝑥),𝐶(𝑦))
          (1) 
Broadly defined, Kolmogorov complexity “is a measure of the computational resources 
needed to specify an object” in an universal descriptive language (Burgin). In our case 
the object is a text, understood as a digital string of characters, and the computational 
resources can be specified as the length of the shortest computer program –written in any 
prefixed programing language– able to produce such an output. 
The researchers reported excellent results for Russian texts, and even for their machine-
translated English versions, as well as in other fields such as music and genomics. Other 
have reported that the technique might be noise-robust, that is resistant to noise (Cebrián, 
Alfonseca, and Ortega, 1895-900), which despite our efforts manually curating is still a 
reality in our corpus. Inspired by the alleged efficacy we applied Cilibrasi and Vitanyi’s 
method virtually unchanged by using a library they released and containerized for others 
to use: the CompLearn Toolkit (Cilibrasi, CompLearn). Once the distances between each 
pair of texts (or concatenated texts per author) are calculated, NCD provides us with a 
                                                 
90 Defined as the “length of the smallest computer program that converts one string into another ... 
authorship can [therefore] be assigned to the training document that would require the least ‘work’ to 
convert to the test document” (Juola, Authorship).

tool to cluster them by their similarity and represent them using a hierarchy. The result is 
an unrooted binary tree in which leaves in the same level have closer small distances. 
Figures 3 and 4 show our results for two different runs: first using an instance-based 
approach, and second a profile-based one. When texts are grouped by author (figure 3),91 
NCD shows that the first and second part of the Lazarillo cluster pretty closely together, 
followed by Fernán Pérez de Oliva, Francisco Cervantes de Salazar, and Francisco 
Delicado. Out of these last three, two are part of the impostors section of our corpus and 
the third, Cervantes de Salazar, although supported by Madrigal using computational 
means, was later rejected. In the next level we find a mix of impostors and genuine 
candidates: Sebastián Fernández, Hurtado de Mendoza (linked to Juan de Malara), 
Gaspar Gil Polo, Fernando de Rojas, and Alfonso de Valdés. The furthest positions 
belong to Juan Arce de Otálora and Pedro Mejía. By all means, these results practically 
contradict Delta’s. We believe that the incomprehensive groupings performed in the 
clustering provided by the NCD tool must be sensible to the class imbalance problem, as 
there seem to be a slight relation between the length of the concatenated texts and the 
closeness at which authors are clustered. On the other hand, results for the instance-based 
approach (see figure 4) 92 make more sense as works belonging to Lope de Rueda are

clustered together, as it happens to a lesser extend to those by Juan Luis Vives and those 
by Pedro Mejía. This provides a more solid foundation to interpret the rest of the tree as 
the method seems to be capturing stylistic similarities rather than text lengths. The 
Lazarillo, with and without interpolations, is first placed close to La Sabiduría (The 
Wisdom) by Vives, and in a second level to his Las Dimensiones de Europa (Dimensions 
of Europe), the second part of the little book, and to Diálogo de las cosas acaecidas en 
Roma by Alfonso de Valdés. Further levels show heterogeneity of authors and their 
works with some smaller clusters. Although the instance-based approach shows some 
signs of coherence, it still lacks credibility. In order to further test the method we decided 
to implement our own approach with more solid compression formats other than BZIP2, 
specially PPM and RAR. 
Markov-based methods have been reported to produce good results in text. Prediction by 
partial matching (PPM) is one of that kind: a probabilistic compression technique –
achieving lossless compression in text– that creates a model with the likelihood of each 
letter appearing after each other. Unfortunately, although Cilibrasi and Vitanyi claimed 
that their tool was able to work with other compression formats, we were unable to put 
PPM to work with the NCD tool, so we built our own NCD implementation in Python 
based on the Debian package ppmd by Dmitry Shkarin and added support for RAR by 
Alexander Roshal (Shkarin, 202-211). For representing the results, and due to the lack of 
the NCD semi-automated output that included the result of the clustering process, we 
calculated the correlation matrix for all pairs of instances and profiles and plotted them 
into a heatmap and a dendrogram (clustermap).93 The color map indicates closer 
similarities with darker colors whereas light colors denote more distance.

NCD combined with the (A) RAR and (B) PPM compression formats. 
As seen in figure 7 no significant difference is noted between BZIP2, PPM, and RAR for 
the profile-based approach:94 the three methods report different groupings of authors. 
Despite some clusters, otherwise irrelevant for our current study, that seem to remain 
together such as Juan Arce de Otálora’s Coloquios de Palatino y Pinciano and Pedro 
Mejía’s Silva de varia lección (A Miscellany of Several Lessons), the only ones in 
common among the different methods are Francisco Delicado and Gaspar Gil Polo. In 
this regard it should be recalled that Navarro Durán insisted in the influx that works such 
as Francisco Delicado’s La Lozana Andaluza –that accounts for a reference to a such 
“Lazarillo”– had in the little book. While huge in Italy, the diffusion of La Lozana 
Andaluza in Spain was small compared to other alleged readings –according to Navarro 
Durán– made by the author of the Lazarillo such as La Celestina by Fernando de Rojas. 
In his critique against Navarro Durán’s proposal in favour of Alfonso de Valdés (Pérez 
Venzalá, El Lazarillo), Pérez Venzalá grants that Delicados’ work was still influential to 
the posterior 16th-century Spanish prose, but that the fact by itself is not enough to argue 
                                                 
94 BZIP2 and RAR NCD performed almost identically.

in favour of the candidacy of the Andalusian. Others were even less inclined to recognize 
such influence in the Lazarillo (Wardropper, 88; Carilla, 97-116). Regarding Gaspar Gil 
Polo there is simply no mention whatsoever of his implication in the little book; the 
notary wrote mostly pastoral romances of a very cult tone.  
The instance-based approach, however, shows more coherent results. Overall, PPM and 
RAR clusters are more consistent between approaches, same authors tend to be found 
regardless. The groups for PPM and RAR share several pairs of (author, work) closely 
related to the Lazarillo and its second part: Diálogo de los Médicos (Dialogue of the 
Physicians) and Coloquio del Convite (Colloquia of the banquet) by Pedro Mejía, and 
Fernán Pérez de Oliva’s Diálogo de la Dignidad del Hombre (Dialogue of the Dignity of 
Men). Unfortunately, the only evidence we have about both the Sevillian humanist Mejía 
and the translator of the classics Pérez de Oliva in relation to the Lazarillo is that they 
moved in the same circles that surrounded the true author. 
Notwithstanding, there are some facts that need to be accounted for in relation to the 
personal information of Pedro Mejía. Born in Seville in 1497, spent his days as a student 
in Salamanca and cultivated the friendship of important figures of his time such as 
Erasmus of Rotterdam and Juan Luis Vives. Mejía held several relevant positions in 
Seville before becoming the official chronicler of Charles V in 1548 after Antonio de 
Guevara’s death. By then he had already written his hugely popular Silva de varia 
lección, that was translated to several languages and circulated all over Europe with 
tremendous success. Other works of his were published in Antwerp at his death in 1551. 
In the literary aspect, some lexical coincidences with the little book have been reported, 
such as “fasta” or “home,”95 although their effect might have been minimized in our 
corpus due to the normalization process applied. Nevertheless, more inscrutable aspects 
of his writing style might have been brought into relevance by our analysis. Pedro Mejía 
seems to be a figure that demands a more thorough analysis.

4.5.2 Decomposing the Lazarillo 
Despite the turn to the abstractness, there is enough evidence to sustain that more 
convoluted and less intuitive features carry more discriminative power than arbitrary 
distributions of words or expressions or over simplistic reduction of writing styles to 
single measures or distances (Argamon and Juola, “Overview”). Simple relative or 
standardized frequencies of words, although presenting both advantages and 
disadvantages (Forsyth and Holmes, 163-174), are usually preferred in traditional studies 
since they convey understandable meaning otherwise hidden in unfathomable statistical 
variables. In their 1988 pioneer study, before embracing his ‘Delta’ method, John 
Burrows and Anthony Hassall solved a disputed authorship based on what they called 
eigenvectors of the correlation matrix from different authors’ function words (usually the 
most common in a language; also called “stop words” in information retrieval studies) 
(Burrows and Hassall, 427-453). Posterior studies confirmed the separation ability of the 
“eigenanalysis” under a variety of cases, both in terms of the features used (function 
words, syntactic tags, etc.) and the works to analyze. The technique was later renamed to 
its proper and original statistical name: Principal Components Analysis (PCA) (Smith, 
“Attribution by statistics” 233-251; “The authorship” 508; “Edmund Ironside” 202-205; 
Binongo, “Incongruity” 477-511; “Joaquin’s” 267-279; Binongo and Smith, “The 
application” 445-466). As a general technique for multivariate analysis, the goal of PCA 
is to reduce the dimensionality of the vector of features, i.e., transform a frequency 
distribution of the most frequent 300 words of a text into a pair of values, by 
summarizing them into new uncorrelated vectors, the so-called principal components, 
that account for the maximal amount of information that can be attributed to them 
(variance). Principal components are sorted by the power to retain the variation of the 
original vectors, and as such, the first two or three components are usually used, as they 
can also be represented graphically, avoiding the hassle of understanding huge correlation 
matrices. 
We used Burrows’ approach and ran a PCA on our corpus mimicking his same setup. As 
the text of the Lazarillo itself is not considered very long when compared to other 
candidates’ works, the segmentation of the works in chunks of 150, 300, or 500 words 
137 
 
 
did not have much effect in the results.96 Nor did the inclusion of the interpolaciones, nor 
the number of stop words used; we tried with 25, 50, 150, and 300 with similar outcomes. 
As shown in figure 6, in the best case we achieved components that accounted in average 
for less than 10% of the variance. Nevertheless, basic PCA still remains a useful first step 
in order to get a glance of a dataset. It is easy to identify visually how some of our 
random candidates in the corpus stand out as the representation of their chunks in the 
general plot are easily distinguishable from those of the little book. The clearer the 
clusters, the less the authors have in common. As such, the authors who exhibit a more 
similar use of function words are Juan Arce de Otálora, Gaspar Gil Polo, Alfonso de 
Valdés, Cristóbal de Villalón, and to a lesser extent, Pedro Mejía and Juan Luis Vives, 
names that are already mentioned in our previous analysis. The rest form more or less 
easily identifiable clusters, thus being the use of stop words different between them. We 
found no difference for the second part of the Lazarillo or taking out the interpolations.

Python with the use of several packages: numpy, scipy, scikit-learn, Pandas, matplotlib, IPython, and 
Jupyter are among the most important ones (Pedregosa et al.; Oliphant; McKinney; Jones, Oliphant, and

98 The tf-idf measure aims to reflect how important a word is to a text in a given corpus. It was introduced 
by Gerard Salton and Michael McGill as the ratio of two previous measures, the frequency of a word (tf) 
and the frequency of that word in the whole corpus (idf). It has been very widely used and applied in 
information retrieval studies ever since (Salton and McGill).

taken into account during the analysis. Matthew’s correlation coefficient (MCC) is

141 
 
 
Moreover, the naive feature set used by Burrows is not the only possible choice. Based 
on recent competitions for authorship attribution and author identification and 
verification (Argamon and Juola, Overview; Stamatatos et al., Overview), we extracted 
the features used by the winners (see table 4) and tested PCA under them for 2, 3, 5, 10, 
and 15 principal components, using the top 25, 50, 150, and 300 top words for 
vocabulary-based features. As the number of works per author is pretty limited in our 
corpus, making an instance-based analysis virtually impossible, we also segmented the 
texts in chunks of 300 words without breaking sentences, although only 600 chunks are 
represented in the charts for clarity reasons. After analyzing all possible combinations of 
this new setup in the search for a set of parameters that maximized the variance, a process 
usually known as grid search in the machine learning literature, we found that 
punctuation marks features, regardless of the number of words per chunk, provided the 
best result accounting for a variance of almost 48%. However, when plotted (see figure 
S1 in SM) there is no obvious way to separate the chunks of the Lazarillo and those 
belonging to the rest of authors. With the exception of perhaps Fernando de Rojas, the 
remainder turned out to be unusable in terms of identification of a possible author. 
Incrementing the number of components had a positive effect on the variance captured by 
the PCA, although we had to reach a balance between the number of principal 
components and the number of dimensions that can be represented in a chart and still be 
useful. By using 5 components we achieved a variance of around 80% with punctuation 
marks features, and after plotting the first 3 principal components, Sebastián Fernández, 
Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, Fernando de Rojas, and Lope de Rueda seem to be 
clustering separate from the Lazarillo (see figure S2 in SM). Higher number of PCs 
reported higher variance but were unsuitable for graphical representation. 
Although revealing under certain circumstances, this capturing of the variance performed 
by PCA is not well suited for authorship attribution nor the general task of automatic 
classification (Juola, “Authorship attribution” 233-334). As seen in our experiments, the 
dimensions that carry the most information does not necessarily have to be the ones that 
allow for an easier identification of the different clusters at game. An alternative 
142 
 
 
technique that alleviates this limitation is the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA),99 first 
formulated by Ronald A. Fisher in 1936 as a 2-class problem and later generalized for the 
multiclass scenario (Fisher, 179-188; Rao, 159-203). LDA is closely related to the 
analysis of variance  (ANOVA, as applied by Holmes and Forsyth to the Federalist) and 
PCA, but in addition to finding the axes that maximize the variance, also finds the axes 
that maximize the separation between different groups.100 Recently LDA has been 
applied successfully to authorship attribution studies, although related literature on the 
topic is scarce (Stamatatos, Fakotakis, and Kokkinakis, 471-95). We tested LDA as a 
dimensionality reduction method under the same settings used for PCA. Our results show 
that LDA might convey more discriminatory power than PCA while capturing similar 
levels of variance. Figure 7 shows clearly separated clusters for all the authors but a few. 
This might suggest that the only viable candidacies might be Pedro Mejía, Alfonso de 
Valdés, Juan Arce de Otálora, and to a lesser extent Juan Luis Vives and Cristóbal de 
Villalón. Other discriminant methods exist: the family of neighbors methods take 
advantage of the visual representation, and group together elements based on the center 
of the cluster, the distance, and other parameters. A version known as nearest shrunken 
centroid has been reported to produce really good results in authorship attribution 
problems (Jockers, Witten, Criddle, 465-491; Schaalje et al., 71-88). 
                                                 
99 This analysis should not be confused with Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a technique formally 
presented in 2003 (although introduced in 2002) by David Blei, Andrew Ng, and Michael I. Jordan for 
topic modelling. It built on a series of improvements over previous techniques (specially from latent 
semantic analysis and its probabilistic version, LSI and pLSI), overcoming some of their limitations such as 
allowing its embedding into other methods. As proposed by its authors, LDA can be seen “as a 
dimensionality reduction technique, in the spirit of LSI, but with proper underlying generative probabilistic 
semantics that make sense for the type of data that it models,” specially when that data is a corpus of texts. 
The specific formulation of LDA is beyond the scope of this study, but generally it models each work from 
a corpus as a mixture of various topics, which are organized following a Dirichlet distribution. Since its 
conception, the technique has been successfully applied in a variety of subjects ranging from history to 
genomics. One recent area of application is precisely authorship attribution studies where LDA is usually 
combined with other methods and achieving good results. Unfortunately, we have not covered Latent 
Dirichlet Allocation in this study (Blei, Ng, and Jordan; Deerwester et al.; Papadimitriou et al.; Hofmann; 
Seroussi, Zukerman, and Bohnert; Savoy) 
100 In doing so, it makes the assumption that the feature set (independent variables) is normally distributed 
143 
 
 
4.5.3 The Rise of the Learning Machines 
Variance and educated guesses over reduced dimensions of a feature set in a plot are 
generally accepted as (exploratory) authorship analysis and as indicators for further 
study. In order to properly assess their efficacy, we recur to the standard framework of 
machine learning measures. Machine learning is a subfield of computer science fed by 
pattern recognition, artificial intelligence, and computational statistics. At its core, it tries 
to construct algorithms that are able to learn from an input of known data (training 
samples) and make predictions or decisions on unseen data. Dependending on how much 
we know about the training samples we talk about supervised learning, if the samples are 
labeled as belonging to classes, or about unsupervised learning when those classes are 
still to be determined, either their number, membership, or both. PCA can be seen as an 
instance of unsupervised learning whereas LDA is supervised learning since it needs the 
labels of the training data to work. In fact, some machine learning methods are able to 
handle big feature sets without applying dimensionality reduction, i.e., Support Vector 
Machines (SVM).101 Regarding authorship attribution, a single training sample would be 
a text from a specific author, either in the instance- or profile-based mode, that is 
transformed into a numerical feature vector in a process of feature extraction; a labeled 
training sample would be the same text annotated with its author. In our context, classes 
would represent the authors of our corpus, and unsupervised methods try to find the 
clusters that better group the works of a same author together; while supervised learning 
methods learn by the examples in order to classify an anonymous into one or more of the 
classes. When categorized by the kind of output machine learning methods produce, 
classification and clustering are among the most relevant in authorship attribution studies. 
Other forms of machine learning include dimensionality reduction, that can also be of 
help, and regression or density estimation, specifically applied to continuum streams of 
data rather than discrete, as it is our case with authors. 
                                                 
101 For an introduction to the topic from the perspective of authorship attribution, we recommend Juola 
(Authorship). 
144 
 
 
Defining authorship attribution problems in the general context of machine learning 
allows us to apply its measures to the case under examination. Despite the existing debate 
around the authorship of some of the works considered in this study –Diálogos by 
Valdés–, we made the arguable initial assumption that our corpus only contains works of 
undisputed authorship, which places this study under the umbrella of supervised learning 
with a close-set corpus. The process goes as follows: first, training data (works labeled 
with their authors) is used to train or learn a model that can be binary if there are only 
two classes to decide, as in the work written by an author or the rest, or multiclass if the 
algorithm is able to deal with more than two, classifying each work to its author. Once 
the model is fitted with the training data a score is extracted to test the adequacy of the 
model. If the performance is good enough,102 the model is asked to predict the label 
(author) of the unseen data (the Lazarillo). One way to assess this score is by holding out 
part of the training data and using it later in the prediction step for validation. Cross-
validation might improve the results and reduce the problem of model overfitting –a 
model that predicts perfectly the training data but fails with new data– by randomly 
segmenting the training set several times (folds), fitting a model for each fold, and 
averaging the score following defined strategies that will be detailed later. Since held-out 
data is labeled (ground truth) we can calculate different measures based on the number of 
correct and wrong predictions. In classification tasks some commonly used measures are 
accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score (F1). Given a class as an author and a data entry 
as a chunk of a work, accuracy is defined as the ratio of chunks correctly assigned to their 
true author (hits) divided by the total number of chunks by each author; precision as the 
ratio between one author hits divided by the total number of chunks correctly or 
incorrectly assigned to that author; recall or sensitivity as the ratio between one author 
hits and the total number of chunks existing by that same author; and F-score as the 
harmonic or weighted mean of precision and recall. In the context of binary 
classification, as it is the case in our LDA analysis, one class is considered “positive” and 
the other “negative,” leading to the definition of the measures in terms of true and false, 
positive and negative rates. These measures go from 0 to 1, where values closer to 1 are 
                                                 
102 This actually depends on the field of study, the model, and the scoring method.

preferred. Another useful measure that arises in the 2-class problem is the Matthews 
correlation coefficient (MCC) that is well suited for tasks where the classes are of 
different sizes, as it is our case with only one work for the anonymous and sometimes 
several or lengthy works for the candidate authors (Powers). MCC is a measure of 
correlation that comprises true and false positive and negative rates (the confusion 
matrix), and it is considered one of the best measures for binary classification. Values of 
MCC range from -1, meaning a total disadjustment between ground truth and prediction, 
to +1, perfect prediction –a value of 0 would mean no better prediction power that a 
random prediction.103 Figure 7 includes values of MCC between parenthesis for the 
binary classification task performed by LDA for each author against the author of the 
Lazarillo. In authorship verification problems, high precision is usually easier to achieve 
than high recall. In the LDA run and after a 10-fold cross-validation, Alfonso de Valdés 
accounted for the lowest values of recall (0.95) and accuracy (0.98), a result that would 
suggest that none of the authors in our corpus would be the true author. In addition to the 
high values obtained for the lowest recall and accuracy, the Matthews correlation 
coefficient reported over 0.85 for all authors but Juan Arce de Otálora, Pedro Mejía, and 
Juan Luis Vives, which give us a quite dubious threshold to start considering them 
plausible candidates for the authorship. Furthermore, this method has been reported to 
perform poorly for authorship attribution even with models much more complex (Koppel, 
Schler, and Bonchek-Dokow, 1261-1276). The use of LDA as a discriminant by itself 
may produce misleading results since it might be affected by factors other than style. We 
must, therefore, further support such findings before making any hurried statement about 
a possible true author. 
Fortunately, once we settle on using general machine learning approaches to authorship 
attribution, a whole range of possibilities opens up. Identifying the most likely author of 
the Lazarillo can be tackled from different angles. We can train a model for every pair of 
authors and assess the accuracy of the method by cross-validation. This approach is 
                                                 
103 It is sometimes compared to the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve that results 
from plotting the true positive rate (recall) against the false positive rate, but it performs better with 
unbalanced classes.

usually referred to in the literature as one-versus-one, as opposed to one-versus-all, where 
the models learn to distinguish an author against the rest. Classification then happens by a 
winner-takes-all strategy in one-versus-one, where the classifier with the best 
performance gets to decides the class–, and by a max-wins strategy in the one-versus-all 
case, in which each classifier adds a vote to a class based on its results, being the class 
with more votes the class that assigns the classification. 
In order to test for the multiclass problem, we extracted the features defined in table 4 
considering the whole corpus when vocabularies of words or characters were needed to 
be taken into account. Our first test using basic regression methods in a supervised 
fashion had very exciting results. We employed linear regression, Bayesian, and 
discriminant (neighbors) classification methods.104 A profile-based version of the corpus 
was built with the texts segmented in chunks of at least 300 words without breaking 
paragraphs. Scores were averaged using a 10-fold cross-validation. Table 5 shows the 10 
most performant algorithms (Ridge, Bernoulli, multinomial, and nearest centroid) and 
features sorted by their accuracy. Common n-grams, and bag-of-words are the features 
that report better results in our corpus, although our total feature set, a combination of all 
the features, behaves slightly better in every case. However, the increase in 
dimensionality that it involves might not be justified by the gain in precision, that barely 
adds up to a 0.12% in the worst case. 
  
                                                 
104 Ridge classification is based on linear least squares; Bernoulli and Multinomial are specific cases of 
Naive Bayes classifiers; and nearest centroid can be related to discriminant analysis. Other classifiers tested 
with poorer results include Gaussian, Perceptron, k-nearest neighbors, radius neighbors, and nearest 
shrunken centroid.

In order to determine the most plausible author we used a max-wins strategy and also the 
average number of chunks assigned to each candidate. In this settings, Juan Arce de 
Otálora, who was assigned the most number of chunks most of the times, seems to be the 
winning author in both cases, with an important difference over the second ones in both 
the win and the average strategies, being those Gaspar Gil Polo and Alfonso de Valdés, 
respectively (see table 6). Interestingly, the result holds with or without interpolaciones 
and also for the second part of the little book –in which case Cristóbal de Villalón is also 
added. It is worth noting that the algorithm that reported the best performance grants the 
second position to Pedro Mejía instead of Gaspar Gil Polo. There seems to be an effect of 
the total number of chunks per author in the corpus over the predictions. The class 
imbalance problem is known to affect drastically the effectiveness of vector space 
models. Several approaches have been proposed in the last years to tackle this situation 
148 
 
 
regarding authorship attribution (Stamatatos, “Author identification” 790-799). 
Segmenting or resampling the texts (reusing some parts of the text) in order to re-balance 
the number of samples per author is one of the methods proposed by Stamatatos for the 
instance-based approach. To alleviate the situation in the profile-based approach, we used 
a cut-off sampling approach by randomly removing the number of chunks that are over a 
fraction of the average number of chunks per author in the corpus, while resampling 
author texts whose number of chunks are said fraction below the average –we used a 
chunk fraction of 10%. We then averaged results over several general machine learning 
methods using 10-fold cross-validation.

Support Vector Machines (SVMs) are binary classifiers in nature and as such they recur 
to ensemble techniques to generalize to the multiclass version. They are intended to work 
with high-order feature vectors by finding a hyperplane (vector) that allows (supports) the 
division of the feature space in two spaces, while maximizing the average of the distances 
from the features vectors to such hyperplane. In a way, they automatize the visual 
inspecting task we performed for exploring the results of the LDA. Used in combination 
with bag-of-words or character n-grams, SVMs are a solid choice for authorship 
attribution, from newspaper articles, to e-mails or 19th-century English literature. Their 
most important characteristic, and the reason why they became so popular, is that they 
can handle several thousands of features without resulting in overfitting or needing 
preprocessing steps (Teng et al., 1204-1207; Sanderson and Guenter, 482-491; Joachims). 
Other models that have reported good results in authorship attribution problems include 
neural networks, decision trees, maximum entropy, memory-based learners, and 
ensemble learning methods.105 Faced with the impossibility of testing every single 
existing method, we resorted once again to the winners of several authorship attribution 
competitions editions that included Spanish corpora, and when suitable, according to the 
specifics of our corpus, we tested some of the best performing methods with the feature 
sets we defined in table 4 (Argamon and Juola, Overview; Juola, “An Overview”; Rangel 
et al; Stamatatos et al., “Overview”; Stamatatos et al., “PAN 2015”). Specifically, we 
tested linear and nonlinear SVMs;106 maximum entropy learning (MaxEnt), a type of 
logistic regression method (not to be confused with linear regression) that measures the 
relationship between features and their assigned author using a logistic function for 
estimating the probabilities (Nigam, Lafferty, and McCallum, 61-67); and random 
forests, an ensemble technique that reduces the overfitting problem in decision trees by 
building a number of them and classifying unseen samples as the most repeatedly 
assigned label (the statistical mode) (Maitra, Ghosh, and Das; Pacheco, Fernandes, and 
                                                 
105 Especially promising is the application of biologically inspired neural networks, such as recurrent and 
convolutional neural nets, that have reported results that outperform state-of-art for the Spanish case 
(Bagnall). 
106 Nonlinear SVMs use transformations of the feature space, specifically we used a gaussian kernel (RBF). 
For an introduction to kernel-based methods in machine learning in general we recommend Nello 
Cristianini and John Shawe-Taylor.

Porco). We also included other less performant algorithms that showed some good results 
for the Spanish case: stochastic gradient descent classification (SGD), an optimization-
based method that can operate with large datasets since only takes one sample at a time, 
and although it might not find the optimum, most of the times it finds a reasonably good 
approximation (Caurcel Díaz and Gómez Hidalgo); and bagging, an ensemble classifier 
that trains decision trees, although other learners can be used, on random subsets of the 
features and combines their prediction by voting (Giraud and Artières). When suitable we 
normalized the feature vectors and reduced their dimensionality up to 100 components 
prior cross-validation.107 Figure 7 shows the 10 best performing algorithms with their 
respective feature sets. They all performed extremely well, especially maximum entropy 
and linear SVMs, and the only difference is the feature set: common characters 3-grams 
and our total fusion of features are again dominating.  
We then used the most performant models to classify the chunks of the Lazarillo to one 
of the candidates finding that Juan Arce de Otálora beat the rest of the authors in both the 
max-wins –9 over 1– and the average criteria –almost 37 out of the 73 chunks of the 
Lazarillo are always assigned to Otálora regardless of the method.108 Second positions 
correspond to Alfonso de Valdés in max-wins and Pedro de Mejía in chunk average. This 
results strongly points out at solid similarities between the writing style of the little book 
and the work by Juan Arce de Otálora. We believe that despite the limitations in our 
corpus and the candidates chosen to represent the debate around the possible author, an 
average of half the chunks assigned to Otálora –ranging from 33% under a SGD learner 
with precision of 94% and bag-of-words features to more than 86% of the chunks under a 
nonlinear SVM with precision of 96% using common 3-grams–, is a strong and data-
based argument in favour of the candidacy of the jurist. 
 
                                                 
107 In fact, we tested with and without dimensionality reduction, and with PCA and LDA, and even after the 
fact that supervised decomposition as the one performed by LDA might bias cross-validation, with obtained 
very similar results and a general speedup when applied. 
108 Results hold with or without interpolations, although for the second part of the little book Cristóbal de 
Villalón seems to be slightly stronger than Otálora.

4.5.4 Unmasking the Author of the Lazarillo 
At the beginning of our study we did our best effort to collect a set of works that would 
sufficiently represent the stronger candidates in the debate about the authorship of the 
Lazarillo. The reason behind was to allow the use of statistical methods in order to 
analyze the problem as a closed-set task. However, our best set of classifiers, even when 
not overfitting, would always assign chunks of any given book to the authors that have 
been trained on. That is the fundamental flaw of the closed vs open-set problem. We 
believe that a consistent prediction of more than half the chunks to Juan Arce de Otálora 
153 
 
 
is not casual, but when asked with the task of classifying an unseen work, the regular 
supervised methods we employed lack a foundation to decide “none of the above” as the 
right answer. In 2004 Moshe Koppel and Jonathan Schler proposed –and improved in 
successive years– a new ensemble method to tackle this issue (Koppel and Schler, 
“Authorship verification”; Koppel, Schler, and Argamon, Authorship; Koppel, Schler, 
and Bonchek-Dokow, Measuring). We used their method, based on feature 
elimination,109 in an attempt to dispel the last doubts about the author of the Lazarillo, 
considering now the problem of its authorship as open-set. 
Ensemble learning techniques usually provide better results and predictive power than 
their algorithms would separately. Koppel and Schler unmasking method is one of the 
best-known techniques of its kind, albeit having numerous subtleties that need to be fine 
tuned corpus-wise. A defining characteristic of their technique is the ability to decide not 
only whether an anonymous text is written by one of the authors in the candidate set, but 
also if the text has not been written by any of them. In its general form it conceives the 
authorship problem as a one-class classification task built upon linear SVMs. Although 
the specifics of its implementation, which we had to develop in Python in the lack of 
reference source code, are out of the scope of this study, the main idea remains rather 
intuitive. Given a set of features for a pair of works the method iteratively removes “those 
features that are most useful for distinguishing between [them]” and “gauge the speed 
with which cross-validation accuracy degrades as more features are removed.” Koppel 
and Schler hypothesize that if two works are written by the same author then “whatever 
differences there are between them will be reflected in only a relatively small number of 
features, despite possible differences in theme, genre and the like.”110 For each pair 
<work, candidate’s works> in the corpus,111 a linear SVM is built to distinguish between 
                                                 
109 It has been noted and we agree on certain similarities between the unmasking method and a technique 
known as feature elimination used in cancer classification (Guyon et al., 389-422; Huang and Kecman, 
185-194). 
110 The efficacy of the method in a cross-genre setup was later confirmed by Mike Kestemont et al. (340-
356). 
111 If for a certain pair, the work in question is by the candidate, we remove said work from the candidate’s 
works for that pair. 
154 
 
 
them. The feature set is bag-of-words-like, with the n most frequent words calculated as 
the average of the frequency in the work and the candidate’s works for a given pair. In a 
number of steps m, the top k most and least informative features are removed and the 
accuracy of the SVM is measured using a 10-fold cross-validation. These n values of 
accuracy that define the degradation curve are used to build a vector of “essential 
features” that is labeled same-author if the work was in fact written by the candidate 
author in the pair, and different-author otherwise. Figure 8 shows an example of 
degradation curves for the work Las Disciplinas by Juan Luis Vives against the rest of 
the candidate authors with default parameters as defined by Koppel and Schler (n=250, 
k=6, m=8). The method assumes that these two types of curves are different and easy to 
identify. A linear SVM is then trained to distinguish between same-author and different-
author curves. When asked to decide on an unseen work, degradation curves are built for 
each of the candidate authors in the corpus, and then the SVM decides if any of the 
unseen work degradation curves are classified as same-author, and in that case return for 
which one. The method does not guarantee that an author will be returned and it does not 
prevent more than one author from being the result. Using Matthew's correlation 
coefficient, we obtained a classification score 0.98. 
Due to the computationally expensive nature of the method, it is usually a good idea to 
reduce the number of authors and works in the corpus, although it is proven that the 
unmasking behaves better with lengthy texts such as books (Sanderson and Guenter, 
Short text). Building upon our previous results, we can now shrink the pool of candidates 
to those that have shown to be likely authors in the previous methods along this study. 
Nonetheless, it is worth noting that some of the candidates that we thought to be mere 
impostors are now among the most plausible ones, i.e., Pedro Mejía. We must interpret 
this as part of the Lazarillo sharing stylistic similarities with the works of others, and 
consequently when reducing our pool of candidates to reduce execution time, we must 
get rid of those authors who were assigned in average less than one chunk of the little 
book. The final list of authors considered for unmasking includes Juan Arce de Otálora, 
Pedro Mejía, Alfonso de Valdés, Gaspar Gil Polo, Lope de Rueda, and Juan Luis Vives. 
Just an ironic coincidence that, as the Avellaneda’s song goes, 6 can be the most likely 
authors of the little book. Moreover, we must highlight the recurrent apparition in our 
155 
 
 
analysis of Cristóbal de Villalón, not only among the possible authors but as the most 
assigned author of the second part of the Lazarillo; thus we included him as well. We 
calculated all the curves and essential feature vectors for the Lazarillo against the 
candidates in our corpus, and the trend shown in figure 9 seems to confirm that Juan Arce 
de Otálora shares the most stylistic similarities with the little book, followed closely once 
again by Alfonso de Valdés, as their drop in accuracy per iteration is larger than for the 
rest of the authors. Unfortunately, we cannot state with enough certainty that either Arce 
de Otálora or Valdés is the true author, since the SVM that distinguished between same- 
and different-author curves did not assign a clear winner; it returned different-author for 
all the authors. Nevertheless, this last result is the last of a series of methods applied 
along this study that support Juan Arce de Otálora as the most likely author. The result, 
however, demands more fine tuning of the parameters of the unmasking method.

4.6 Discussion 
Coinciding with the statistical approach carried out by Madrigal, Juan Arce Otálora has 
been consistently assigned high positions in the analysis of the authorship of the 
Lazarillo, but if we are to accept the result by Burrows’s Delta and Koppel and Schler 
unmasking method, the evidence is not enough to support him being the true author: both 
methods agree on the prominent similarity between Arce de Otálora and Alfonso de 
Valdés’ writing styles, but suggest that any of them is in fact the author. We add, 
nevertheless, that the candidacy for Arce de Otálora has been strongly supported. 
Deficiencies are in general attributable to the corpus rather than the methodology. Diego 
Hurtado de Mendoza, on the other hand, one the most documented candidates of all and 
possibly the one towards whom we felt more confident, turned out not to be a strong 
player in our analysis. We believe that one of the reasons is the lack of representation of 
his works in our corpus. Hurtado’s De la Guerra de Granada might not be the best work 
to put on play against Lazarillo, or at least not the only one, as the linguistic registry is 
very different in both cases. As Ángel González Palencia pointed out, Hurtado de 
Mendoza’s informal style expressed in his personal letters would account for a better 
representation in the corpus, but he also considers that style of writing not to be precisely 
descriptive of Mendoza’s, as letters had to be usually written with haste. That is, if the 
157 
 
 
style of Lazarillo were to be similar to Mendoza’s, it would have to be similar to a style 
which he never would use to write prose, unless it was written as a joke for a then young 
prince, as Agulló argues. 
In either case, as the study advanced, we tried to minimize the effect of the class 
imbalance problem, and when critical for certain methods, it turned out not to be such an 
obstacle. Alfonso de Valdés, whose works were not precisely the longest ones, still had 
been consistently given as one likely author. This study might sustain Valdés’ candidacy 
in relation to the internal evidence when compared to the little book, oftentimes the 
reason of the criticism to Navarro Durán’s candidate. 
Juan Luis Vives, the candidate with the longest corpus and brought to the discussion in 
the initial exploration methods, was ultimately not sufficiently supported by any of the 
supervised learning techniques. A similar case is Lope de Rueda, who showed in the 
methods affected by the imbalanced-class problem but disappeared later. Other authors 
such a Fernán Pérez de Oliva or Fernando Delicado were soon removed from the debate. 
For those that were not part of the impostors we believe that this study is proof enough to 
reject their candidacies. And for the impostors that in the end resulted to share stylistic 
similarities with the little book, we believe there is a demand for further research in their 
cases, as for Pedro Mejía as a possible contributor of the Lazarillo, or even Cristóbal de 
Villalón for the second part, which deserves its own study. The hypothesis of a multiple 
authorship might also be backed up if we only consider the style markers evidence 
brought up by our study, and although not accountable or usable by literary critics as the 
features sets that carried the most discriminative power were undecipherable in a human 
context, we provide with stylistic proof that might support the idea. 
4.7 Conclusions 
This study started with an overview of the status of the question of the authorship of the 
Lazarillo, which allowed us to establish a baseline corpus of candidates to work with. 
The subsequent exploratory analysis employing distance-based measures and methods 
from unsupervised learning started to give the first hints. Juan Arce de Otálora and 
Alfonso de Valdés were then highlighted and soon supported by the use of more 
158 
 
 
sophisticated methods. The majority of the statistical evidence seem to point out in the 
direction of Arce de Otálora by a wider margin with regards to Valdés, and while our 
corpus is not as comprehensive as the one used by Madrigal, the jurist is still chosen by 
the learning methods as the most likely author. It seems as if all statistical techniques 
agree on Arce de Otálora, which supports the hypothesis of Madrigal, but it might not be 
the ultimate proof the authorship needs. Open-set methods suggest that none of the 
authors wrote the little book. After all, if, as Francisco Rico mentions in his 2011 edition 
(Anónimo ed. Rico, 128), the Lazarillo was the only work written by his author, any 
method, computational or not, based on the comparison of styles, mentions, idioms, or 
fingerprints, turns out to be useless. Under such assumption and due to the lack of other 
texts used as clues, the traditional historiographic profile-based research stands out as our 
only chance to find the author. 
The Erasmian answer to the question of the authorship is recursively based on the 
principle of authority: it is important to unmask the anonymous of a work if the writer is 
in fact an important author. In recent times, the author might not ever be of interest at all, 
as the Barthesian conception of the death of the author considers. Others, however, agree 
on that knowing the author of a work “changes its meaning by changing its context [...,] 
certain kinds of meaning are conferred by its membership and position in the book or 
oeuvre” (Love, Attributing, 46). Paraphrasing Love, Lazarillo by Diego Hurtado de 
Mendoza, with its life parallels and allusions, is a different story that Lazarillo by Friar 
Juan de Ortega or Pedro Mejía. While this study helps to dispel doubts around some of 
the most often cited authors for the little book, we still believe that the authorship of the 
Lazarillo plays an important role in the work. Unlike Américo Castro, we do not give 
much importance to the fact of the anonymity itself but to the actual 400 year-old debate 
about who the author might be. Discovering new authors and arguing in favor or against 
them injects with life the adventures of such Lázaro de Tormes. Every time a new author 
is proposed, a new reading is found in the Lazarillo. Because of this, part of us hopes 
nobody ever finds the definitive factual proof to prove the authorship, as that would take 
away all the fun from it.

4.8 Further Research 
Much is still to be done regarding computational approaches for the resolution of the 
anonymity of the Lazarillo. Forensic linguistics also includes problems related to author 
plagiarism and author clustering, which could help to identify, for example, the 
legitimacy of the interpolaciones as part of the text of the Lazarillo, or to discern whether 
different hands intervened in the creation of the little book. Debates in this context, 
however, can also be enriched by the use of modern techniques such as those of the social 
network analysis. Previous studies in different areas have proven to be useful in shedding 
some light and contributing to the discussion of similar questions by the study of the 
graph structure of the actors involved (Suárez, Sancho, and de la Rosa, 281-285; Suárez 
et al., fqt050; Suárez, Sancho Caparrini, and de la Rosa; Suárez, McArthur, and Soto-
Corominas, 45-50). While the use of this technique for authorship attribution would 
hardly result in a final answer, it configures an interesting path worth exploring in further 
research. 
Compiling a better corpus to test authorship verification for each of the authors is another 
important future direction for investigation. Adding more authors and more works to the 
corpus could only benefit the study of the authorship of the little book. If both individual 
and institutional efforts were to be combined, the anonymity of the little book could be 
solved once and for all. Hundreds of mathematicians were able to altruistically combine 
their efforts to solve century-old problems (Gowers and Nielsen, 879-81; Cranshaw and 
Kittur, 1865-1874), therefore we believe that literary experts could do so as well for the 
Lazarillo. Having access to the digital editions that presumably RAE’s CORDE handles 
as its core, or agreements with the editors of critical editions of Spanish Golden Age 
literature in order to use the same normalization rules for the old Spanish language, are 
only a couple of suggestions that could skyrocket the research on the topic. Moreover, 
proper coordination and agile communication channels to share early discoveries would 
be key factors to take into account. Traditional and nontraditional studies need to 
handshake and start a path together if we aim to find that elusive author of the 
masterpiece that is The Life of Lazarillo de Tormes and of His Fortunes and Adversities.

Conclusions 
At the beginning of this dissertation we defended how properly informed questions of 
humanistic tradition can be formulated, enriched, and answered by computational means. 
In this respect, we covered three different case studies to illustrate each. The analysis of 
more than 120,000 pictures of paintings is a task that would demand a lifetime to be 
achieved. A “distant reading” approach might reduce that time to several months, at the 
expense of losing the existing theoretically-constructed criticism, but fostering the need 
of new frameworks to overcome this limitation. It is not sufficient to defend the 
legitimacy of the older instance-based studies when technology enables us to raise new 
questions and engages us in them. Both approaches must work together and harmonize, 
reconcile, and coordinate efforts. Our second study built upon the notion of empathy, an 
apparently intractable subject for machines. However, by using sentiment analysis as a 
proxy, we further supported the mischievous nature of Calderón de la Barca when trying 
to reach different audiences in his massively popular autos sacramentales. In this case, 
we just confirmed an existing debatable argument of the Baroque through different and 
more objective means. Finally, we tackled one of the biggest mysteries of Hispanic 
literature, namely the author of the Lazarillo. Non-traditional authorship studies have 
been long constructing upon internal analysis their arguments to solve this “problem”, 
and in the process had to deal with learning computational tools and statistics. It has been 
surprising to find the scarcity of such approaches in Spanish Golden Age literature. While 
given the evidence found, we must not state who the author was, the consistent 
appearance of Juan Arce de Otálora and Alfonso de Valdés might engage new scholars 
into looking for further evidence, outside of the internal realms of the works. Of course, 
as in all data-based research endeavors, the better the dataset the better the conclusions 
we can infer from our analysis.  
Computers do not think (yet), but they are outperforming humans in several specific 
tasks: recognizing and identifying faces, analyzing sentence structure and coherence, 
summarizing texts, calculating frequencies, generalizing and extracting polarity 
expressed, etc. Humanists should not miss this opportunity, where all the manual work 
can be made faster and in greater volumes. This puts the scholar in an arguably 
189 
 
 
uncomfortable position. On one hand, humanists can now study wider and larger periods 
of time, more works, plays, or films, as they are being digitized or just born digital. On 
the other hand, it requires a new methodological and theoretical framework to validate 
their findings, an exercise that, unfortunately, not everyone is willing to undergo. 
However, results must continue to be analytically studied, not in the sense of quantifiable 
statistics, but in addition to the proper humanistic inquiry that the results demand. The 
type of research that computers aid has not been yet assimilated or comprehended by the 
traditional practitioners. Computational algorithms bring new possibilities of inquiry. 
Some still lack the critical apparatus that has been in development for the rest of 
humanities for decades, but this unfair advantage is precisely the reason that makes 
digital humanities and cultural analytics so appealing to novel and old scholars alike. 
Some questions, simply, could not be answered by traditional means. Critique against the 
computational turn tries furiously to delegitimize the use of machines in humanities 
endeavours, arguing that the lack of a solid critical foundation makes their insights 
unbearable and ultimately unnecessary or irrelevant –i.e., they add nothing. We agree that 
technological advancements and the use of computers without a proper research question 
fall into the category of didactic exercises, just for fun. But ignoring, or worse, attacking 
the potential of technology and its applications is a mistake of historical perspective. The 
theoretical framework that could put digital humanities in a relevant, not fashionable, 
position might yet remain to be developed but that is a path worth exploring. 
Accusations of the shortsighted view of digital humanities only denote a fear of the pre-
established position that at the moment detents the power. Argumenting that the 
hermeneutical limitations of computers can only lead to misguided results is unfounded 
and detrimental for the advancement of the disciplines and knowledge of the human 
being and its condition. What remains clear is that questions about what makes us human 
are more relevant than ever and that cultural analytics, and its application of big data 
analysis to the behaviour of human beings in their context, will play a key role in helping 
understand what is human in an age of change. 
In the context of beauty, exact measurements such as averageness and symmetry help us 
better understand the various ways in which human faces have been depicted throughout 
190 
 
 
the history of painting. As attested by art historians through traditional scholarship, these 
representations have not always remained constant, as different artistic styles have 
attempted their own ways of capturing facial beauty. After our analysis, we can conclude 
that there have been variations in the form in which faces have been represented over 
time, and that these variations can be measured and tracked accurately. While there is a 
clear trend conforming to features of classical representation of the human face from the 
15th to the 18th centuries, both the 13th-century –Gothic style– and contemporary art 
have shown clear deviations from the classical paradigm. Especially interesting is the 
data from 20th-century artistic styles, which shows low levels of both symmetry and 
averageness as well as a reduced proportion of total faces captured when compared to 
previous centuries. 
These results conform to the views of art historians regarding the aesthetic and 
methodological disruptions that occurred after the vanguards. There has arguably been a 
change in the concept of art itself, as well as in the theories that explain and criticize it. 
Nowadays, it is accepted that the representation of the human does not necessarily 
attempt to represent beauty. This shift in thought is clear in the data analysis and opens 
the door to a second phase of the investigation. By contrasting the aesthetic theories of 
specific periods and artists against the data, we would be able to establish their levels of 
conformity to and deviation from the objective measures of beauty. This would allow us 
to complement the qualitative and conceptual analysis of art history with the study of 
quantitative data. Combining these two levels appropriately should be one of the 
methodological aims of any culturomics science. 
The separation from the classical mode of representing the human being in contemporary 
art also serves as a reminder of the bias that we imposed on the analysis of perceived 
beauty by employing such accurate measuring systems. This bias also shows the 
interestingly close relationship between classic ideas of beauty and art in Western 
cultures, and mathematical notions that support data-driven methods of research. While it 
is evident that the examples in Picasso’s, Duchamp’s, and Pollock’s works show 
deviations from painting styles which depict faces that conform better to measures of 
symmetry and averageness, the judgment of whether these human faces are more (or less) 
191 
 
 
beautiful than previous cases remains an aesthetic one. The contingency of aesthetic 
values is subject to fads, trends, reactions, and public opinion (Dutton). Better algorithms 
can help us be more precise in the measurement of objective elements, although it has to 
be noted that the discipline that studies how social movements get started, become 
important, and disappear, remains in its infancy (Pentland). Once we have improved the 
way to measure and analyze both the internal features of art works and the dynamics of 
social movements that create judgments about those works, we will be able to approach 
these types of problems in a more accurate manner. 
Another relevant factor to take into account is the sampling we used for the study and 
how representative it is. While we are certain about the validity of the used set as related 
to art history, it is impossible to ascertain how representative these faces are of the real 
populations living in the various historical periods. However, we have observed that there 
is a correlation between the production of various types of media and the size of the 
human population in various countries throughout time. The more people there are, the 
more media is produced. This correlation remains true for paintings. 
Although not explicitly discussed in our analysis of paintings, we also verified that age, 
gender and face orientation, along with symmetry and averageness in the representation 
of human faces in paintings, can become a complementary and objective way to identify 
and characterize styles and movements. Along with the exhaustive tagging for 
techniques, materials, and the analysis and recording of chemical products used in art 
production, this could become the basis for the culturomics of art history (Michel et al., 
176-182).3 Nevertheless –and although this does not contradict our findings– it is clear 
that there is also a variety of complex social, aesthetic, and evolutionary elements that 
influence our judgment of beauty. Capturing these constructs into proper algorithms has 
not resulted (yet) in perfect solutions to account for changes in perceived beauty. As we 
have previously stated, this has to do in part with the close relation between classic ideas 
and mathematical models that biased the analysis towards certain ideas of beauty. It is 
also important to note that many of these variations are due to the pressure that culture 
exerts in the short term on the adoption of different traits, and the deviations that this 
provokes from well-established, long-term genetic features related to beauty, 
192 
 
 
reproduction, and social acceptance and belonging (Suárez, Sancho, and de la Rosa, 281-
281). Thus, it is important that any approach to the culturomics of art history and beauty 
also take into account cultural evolution and cultural history as forces that shape the 
results we find in the data, and that have to contribute to the explanation of these results. 
Alongside our second study, we analysed almost 37,000 sentences constructed from 
verses in dramatic and allegorical plays. Since our main objective was to demonstrate 
whether Calderón could be considered a mass influencer or not and what artefacts he 
used in order to become one, we built an automated classifier to annotate all the sentences 
in his works. Afterwards, we tagged all the sentences and characters of the plays and 
discovered the predominance of characters of allegorical and biblical dimension in the 
social spheres of nobility, laymen, and theological abstractions, which clearly compose 
the intended audience of the autos as these were staged in public spaces and free of 
charge for the entire population of Madrid.  
Women seemed to be slightly underrepresented as compared to men, which could be 
considered normal taking into account the different social and historic context of when 
the plays were written. On the other hand, female members of the lay population, clergy, 
nobility, and supernatural spheres had more sentences classified as positive, which left 
men as an authority on moral and soul-related affairs, as far as our typology of characters 
is concerned.  
We concluded by saying that the architecture of sentiments in Calderón’s autos is as 
complex as the dramatic structure of baroque plays, and that the various metaphysical and 
rhetorical interconnected levels of baroque technologies of speech make it difficult to 
draw firm conclusions about the empathy of the characters and the machination of the 
messages by baroque authors. Data, however, can be contradictory sometimes. For 
example, according to our methodology, the villains’ speeches were classified as positive, 
which is in line with the notion of the engaño (deceit) practised in the Baroque, but 
villains were not the ones with the highest values of positive messages –philistines, 
muslims, and jews presented even higher values. In other cases, it is hard to decide 
whether Calderón was using characters’ speeches to send clear religious messages or just 
193 
 
 
as devices to fool the audience and play with the public. Be that as it may, the twisted 
nature of the Baroque was once again brought to light.  
The last study, concerning the authorship of Lazarillo, started with an overview of the 
possible authors, which allowed us to establish a baseline corpus of candidates to work 
with. The subsequent exploratory analysis employing distance-based measures and 
methods from unsupervised learning started to give the first hints. Juan Arce de Otálora 
and Alfonso de Valdés were then highlighted and soon supported by the use of more 
sophisticated methods. The majority of the statistical evidence seems to point at the 
direction of Arce de Otálora by a wider margin with regards to Valdés, and while our 
corpus is not as comprehensive as the one used by Madrigal, Arce de Otálora is still 
chosen by the learning methods as the most likely author. It seems that all statistical 
techniques agree on Arce de Otálora, which supports the hypothesis of Madrigal, but 
might not be the ultimate proof the authorship needs. Open-set methods suggest that none 
of the authors wrote the little book. After all, if, as Francisco Rico mentions in his 2011 
edition (Anónimo ed. Rico), Lazarillo was the only work written by his author, whoever 
that might be, any method, computational or not, based on the comparison of styles, 
mentions, idioms, or fingerprints, turns out to be useless. Under such an assumption and 
due to the lack of other texts used as clues, the traditional historiographic profile-based 
research stands out as our only chance to find the author. 
The Erasmian answer to the question of authorship is recursively based on the principle 
of authority: it is important to unmask the anonymous author of a work if the writer is in 
fact an important author. In recent times, the author might not even be of interest at all, as 
the Barthesian conception of the death of the author considers. Others, however, agree 
that knowing the author of a work “changes its meaning by changing its context ... certain 
kinds of meaning are conferred by its membership and position in the book or oeuvre” 
(Love). Paraphrasing Love, Lazarillo by Diego Hurtado de Mendoza, with its life 
parallels and allusions, is a different story than Lazarillo by Friar Juan de Ortega or Pedro 
Mejía. While this study helps to dispel doubts around some of the most often cited 
authors for the little book, we still believe that the authorship of the Lazarillo plays an 
important role in the work. Unlike Américo Castro, we do not give much importance to 
194 
 
 
the fact of the anonymity itself but to the actual 400 year-old debate about who the author 
might be. Discovering new authors and arguing in favor of or against them injects with 
life the adventures of Lázaro de Tormes. Every time a new author is proposed, a new 
reading is found in the Lazarillo. Because of this, part of us hopes nobody ever finds the 
definitive factual proof to prove the authorship, as that would take away all the fun from 
it. 
All previous examples follow the same pattern. There exists, first, an intellectual 
challenge. Solutions to research questions are attempted by traditional means, and later, 
by incorporating technology into the equation. Due to the lack of methodologies that suit 
the specific needs, the only possible path is to expand and to adapt the available 
techniques. In some cases, it will be a matter of writing new algorithms as an ensemble of 
machine learning methods. Others will require creating customized corpora to improve 
accuracy in predictions. Finally, there will be cases where combining computer science 
with knowledge from other fields –such as neuroscience– is one possible way to achieve 
the research goals. In either case, throughout these examples, we believe that the 
complementary nature of the research in computer science with regards to digital 
humanities has been successfully defended and that our knowledge of the three cases 
studied has been expanded.
