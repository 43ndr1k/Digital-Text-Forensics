In this paper, we will present a mathematical analysis of the transition proportion for the normal
threshold (NorT) based on the transition method. The transition proportion is a parameter of NorT which
plays an important role in the theoretical development of NorT. We will study the mathematical forms of
the quadratic equation from which NorT is computed. Through this analysis, we will describe how the
transition proportion affects NorT. Then, we will prove that NorT is robust to inaccurate estimations of
the transition proportion. Furthermore, our analysis extends to thresholding methods that rely on Bayes
rule, and it also gives the mathematical bases for potential applications of the transition proportion as a
feature to estimate stroke width and detect regions of interest. In the majority of our experiments, we
used a database composed of small images that were extracted from DIBCO 2009 and H-DIBCO 2010
benchmarks. However, we also report evaluations using the original (H-)DIBCO's benchmarks.

1. Introduction
Binarization is the process of identifying pixels that contain
relevant information for the specific application. This set of pixels
is named foreground and its complement set is the background.
For the purposes of this paper, foreground pixels are those pixels
that constitute ink strokes.
Applications like optical character recognition [1,2], thinning
[3,4], document layout analysis [5,6], text segmentation [7,8], and
writer identification [9,10], rely on features that are extracted either
from foreground pixels at a binary level, or from information (gray
intensities, color, textures) subjected to foreground pixels. Hence,
noisy binary inputs tend to systematically propagate noise through-
out the whole system and, consequently, binarization is a crucial
task for document analysis.
The binarization of historical documents is a difficult task since
such documents frequently have complex structures and heavy
degradation. The former refers to the nature of the text and
background themselves, such as faded strokes, stroke width
variability, different types and sizes of fonts, irregular angle text
orientations, and background printing patterns. The latter refers to
interfering patterns that are a product of artifact or document
aging, such as irregular illumination, blurring, bleed-through, ink
stains, smudged characters, and paper fold outlines.
Due to the their complexity, many research groups currently
work on binarization methods for historical documents [11–15].
Some of these methods are listed in Table 1 along with the types of
features that the methods exploit. Our primary sources to con-
struct this table were Elsevier and Springer digital libraries,

although selected papers from other libraries and conference
proceedings were also included.
From Table 1, we can see that these binarization methods
involve a great deal of parameters. Readers may notice that some
authors of these methods claim that their methods have none or
few parameters. However, these authors neglect values that are
taken as constants, or that have been computed in an unsuper-
vised manner. In [22], for instance, the authors proposed a
threshold that is a generalization of Otsu's method. They claim
that it is a parameterless threshold, but their threshold equation
involves a parameter, namely ks, which was empirically set to
1.6 in all their experiments.
According to Table 1, few authors report formal experimental
analyses on how the method's parameters affect its performance,
and none of them report formal mathematical analyses of the
method's parameters. The lack of parameter analyses is a serious
problem not only to select suitable parameters' values for different
types of images, but also to ensure the system's robustness. For
example, Sauvola and Pietikäinen [37] proposed a threshold for a
variety of degraded documents (none of them historical). They
empirically found that the optimal value of one of its crucial
parameters, namely k, was 0.5. On the other hand, the same
threshold is computed as a step in Gatos et al.'s method [35], but
Gatos et al. claimed that k¼0.2 was a more suitable value for
historical documents after some tests. In both papers, the optimal
k's values were empirically selected by a human expert and, as a
consequence, we cannot infer if the optimal k's value depends on
the type of image (historical or non-historical for instance), or on
the neighborhood size (since Sauvola's threshold is locally com-
puted), or on some other features.
The importance of the parameter selection motivates us to
present a parameter analysis of the transition method for binar-
ization [38] (reviewed in Section 3), which is part of our ongoing
project of digitization of historical documents. The novelty of our
contribution is the manner we tackled the analysis of a single
parameter, namely transition proportion. For this aim, we examine
the transition proportion to calculate the parameter intrinsic bias
(Section 4.1), formulate analytical inequalities (Section 4.2),
observe empirical distributions (Section 4.3), determine some
value's convergences (Table 3), and compute the bias under
theoretical distributions (Section 4.4). We believe that this paper
is a reference for parameter analyses in binarization methods even
when our analysis is focused on our method's parameter.
The transition proportion is deeply involved in the theoretical
formulation of thresholding methods based on the transition
method and the minimum error rate (Bayes' rule), as shown in
Section 3.3. In the Bayesian approach, the product of the a priori
class probability and the class-conditional probability determines
the pixel classification in favor of the likeliest class; for binariza-
tion this is either foreground or background. Following the
Bayesian approach, the transition method estimates the a priori
class probability with the transition proportion. Hence, our math-
ematical analysis extends to other methods that also rely on Bayes'
rule. For instance, Hedjam's method [23] assumes that the a priori
probabilities of observing both fore and background pixels are
equal within the pixel neighborhoods. This assumption is not
fulfilled in most of the pixels' neighborhoods but, in spite of this
simplification, the performance of Hedjam's method is comparable
to state-of-the-art binarization methods; see Table 7. Our current
analysis partially justifies why a simplification such as Hedjam's
method does not crucially affect the method's performance.
In Section 4.2, we will describe some mathematical connec-
tions between the transition proportion and its performance. We
will show that the a priori class probability has a small impact on
the threshold selection as long as the gray intensities' means and
variances are accurately estimated.

Later on, we will describe the statistical distribution of the
transition proportion (Section 4.3). Subsequently, we will report
two objective performance evaluations of the transition method
(Section 5): the former evaluation shows that the transition sets
within the region of interest can be accurately estimated by standard
transition operators. The latter evaluation compares different var-
iants of the transition method with the state-of-the-art methods.
In this paper, the method's implementation is an improved
version of our method in [28] and it is the version submitted to
DIBCO 2013 [15]. Our method estimates the transition proportion
automatically for each pixel; previously, it was a constant for all
pixels. Furthermore, it detects regions of interest by considering a
lower bound of the transition proportion; previously it was a
predefined number of pixels. We also added pre- and post-
processes to reduce the pixel misclassification due to bleed-
through and bi-level backgrounds. However, the details of the
extra pre- and post-process are given in the paper's supplemen-
tary material since they are not the main goal of this paper and
some of the processes are in preparation for publication.
2. Image dataset
Throughout this paper, we will support our theory with
empirical data computed from a database composed of 245
images. We extracted these images from 15 handwritten images:
5 handwritten test images plus 2 handwritten examples of DIBCO
2009, and 8 of 10 images of H-DIBCO 2010. Two images of
H-DIBCO 2010 (H05 and H07) were excluded from the analysis
since both images have overwhelming artifacts due to compres-
sion artifact rather than to aging or printing degradation. These
extracted images are small regions of interest usually containing a
single word. Examples of these images are shown in Fig. 1.
From now on, we will refer to these images as our database, or
our dataset. However, in Section 5.2, we used the original (H-)
DIBCO's benchmark from 2009 to 2013 [12–15,39].
3. Overview of the transition method
Since our parameter analysis is derived from the transition
method, we will devote this section to review the method's main
steps. In particular, we will review the thresholds based on
transition sets and define our parameter of interest, namely the
transition proportion.
3.1. Notation
We denote pixels in bold while we denote the gray intensity of
a pixel p as IðpÞAN, where black is set to zero, and the color white
is set to g. The image of gray intensities is denoted by I.
We denote the fore and background sets by F and B, respec-
tively, such that P ¼F [ B. The neighborhood of a pixel p,
denoted by PrðpÞ, are those pixels within a square centered at
the pixel p, of sides with length 2rþ1: Moreover, given a set of
pixels A, we will write ArðpÞ as shorthand for A \ PrðpÞ. For
instance, BrðpÞ ¼ B \ PrðpÞ denotes the pixels in the background
within a neighborhood of radius r, around the pixel p.
In the following sections, we will adopt the thresholding
approach as
BðpÞ ¼
1 ðforegroundÞ if IðpÞrTðpÞ;
0 ðbackgroundÞ otherwise;
(
ð1Þ
where B denotes the binary image of I, and TðpÞ is the threshold
calculated for p.
3.2. The transition method
The transition method was proposed in [38] and subsequently
improved in [28,40]. It assumes that the distribution of both fore
and background gray intensities can be approximated by the
distribution of gray intensities particularly of those pixels within
their corresponding extended contour, namely t-transition pixels;
see Fig. 2.
A t-transition pixel is a pixel that contains both fore and
background pixels in its neighborhood of radius t. The set of
t-transition pixels tP can be divided into two disjoint subsets:
tF ¼ tP \ F and tB ¼ tP \ B.
In the transition method, only information from t-transition
pixels is used to compute the threshold surface such that tF and
tB are considered as representative samples of F and B, respec-
tively. This method is divided into six steps:
1. Compute the transition values for each pixel by
VðpÞ ¼ max
qAPt ðpÞ
IðqÞ þ min
qAPt ðpÞ
fIðqÞg2IðpÞ; ð2Þ
where t is small. In our experiments, t ¼ 2.
2. We expect that (2) attains high values for positive transition
pixels, high negative values for negative transition pixels, and
values close to zero for non-transition pixels. Hence, the
transition sets approximations are defined by
tF̂ ¼ fp∣VðpÞZtþ g and tB̂ ¼ fp∣V ðpÞrt g; ð3Þ
where tþ and t are computed by the double linear threshold [28]
which is a thresholding for unimodal histograms.
3. Enhance tF̂ and tB̂ ; see [28].
4. Calculate the region of interest:
R̂ ¼ fp such that jtF̂ rðpÞjZnþ and jtB̂rðpÞjZn g; ð4Þ
where nþ and n are two positive integers: tF̂ rðpÞ ¼ tF̂ \
PrðpÞ and tB̂rðpÞ ¼ tB̂ \ PrðpÞ.
Fig. 1. Examples of our database.

5. Label p as background if p=2R̂: Otherwise, compute a local
threshold TðpÞ from the information from the transition sets;
see Section 3.3.
6. Restore F̂ and B̂ with standard algorithms. For example,
removing small connected components.
3.3. Binarization by transition sets
In the following subsections, we assume that the thresholds are
computed on regions of interest where both fore and background
are not empty.
3.3.1. Minimum-error-rate transition
In Bayesian decision theory, the probability of a pixel misclas-
sification is minimized by Bayes' decision rule: classify p as
foreground if
PrðpAF rðpÞ∣IðpÞ ¼ iÞZPrðpABrðpÞ∣IðpÞ ¼ iÞ: ð5Þ
Otherwise, classify p as background.
Under Bayes' criteria, the probability of error in PrðpÞ is given
by

i ¼ 0
min Hf ðiÞ;HbðiÞ
 
; ð6Þ
where Hf ðiÞ and HbðiÞ denote the occurrence of fore and back-
ground pixels with gray intensity i that are within F rðpÞ and BrðpÞ,
respectively.
If the class-conditional densities of BrðpÞ and F rðpÞ are unknown,
t̂ opt cannot be computed. However, the transition method assumes
that the intersection of such densities is approximately the same
intersection between the gray-intensity densities of the positive and
negative transition sets.
The minimum-error-rate threshold based on transition sets,
named MER transition, is defined as

tF rðpÞ and tBrðpÞ, respectively, and
wþ ¼ jtF r ðpÞjjtPrðpÞj
ð9Þ
is the transition proportion in tPrðpÞ.
3.3.2. Normal transition
The normal threshold based on transition sets (normal transi-
tion) assumes that the transition pixels' gray intensities are
approximately normally distributed within a neighborhood of
radius r. Thus, the optimal threshold is the intersection between
gray-intensity distributions of both the positive and negative
transition sets.
Generally, the threshold is the root μþ o t̂oμ of a quadratic
equation with coefficients aa0, b, and c given by

of gray intensities in tBrðpÞ, and w ¼ 1wþ .
In [38] a special case was omitted when sþ ¼ s ¼s40,
which implies that a¼0. Thus, the threshold is given by

To avoid numerical problems with the term a, we also computed (13)
if jsþ s jo1. In this manner, we also avoided numerical problems
that arose when sþ  s .
Another problem is caused when some estimated terms of (10)
are considerably inaccurate. Namely when no root of (10) may be
between μþ and μ . In such cases, we computed the autolinear
threshold [38] defined as
t̂ ¼ μþ þ

3.3.3. Lognormal transition
The lognormal threshold based on transition sets (lognormal
transition) is derived in a similar manner to the normal transition.
It is computed by expðt̂ Þ, where t̂ is the root of the quadratic
equation with coefficients given by (10), but replaces μþ and s2þ
with ~μþ and ~s

4. Transition proportion
As we mentioned in Section 1, our main goal with this paper is to
analyze the transition proportion's role on binarization thresholds.
In [28,38,41], the transition proportion was assumed to be a constant,
namely 0.5. Without formal study, however, the positive outcomes in
their evaluations could be attributed to the particular properties of
the tested images. Hence, this section shows that the normal thresh-
old based on transition sets is indeed robust to rough estimates of the
transition proportion in the context of handwritten historical docu-
ments. In addition, we will give some suitable values for wþ
depending on the pixel's neighborhood size and its type of strokes.
4.1. Analysis of bias
Before we study the effects of the transition proportion on the
transition method, we will first study the transition method's bias
when the distributions of transition sets are known. Then, we can
determine how the transition proportion impacts the method's
performance.
We conducted an experiment to study its bias: for the ith image
and jth thresholding method, the threshold bias is defined as
Biasij ¼cErijMERi ð17Þ
where MERi is the minimum error rate in the ith (globally
computed) and cErij is the error rate of the jth thresholding method
for the ith image.
Our results, summarized in Fig. 3 and Table 2, confirm that the
bias of thresholds based on transition sets is marginal compared
with the minimum error rate (lower than 0.2%). Therefore, this
experiment ensures that any bias observed in the following
sections is a result of an inaccurate transition proportion and of
the thresholds' intrinsic bias.
4.2. Mathematical form of the transition proportion
The transition method can attain different estimated transition
sets in such a manner that the means and variances of both
approximations marginally differ from each other, but their
positive transition proportions are significantly different. For
example, Fig. 4 shows two approximations of the transition set
with different transition proportions (Fig. 4(c) and (d)); never-
theless both approximations lead to approximately the same
means.
To understand the transition proportion's influence in the
normal transition, we must observe that the transition proportion
only appears in the constant term of (10) and, as a consequence,
the transition proportion's role in the threshold can be analyzed
within the symmetry of the quadratic equation

Notice that the upper bound for d does not depend on the
specific definition of the transition method, in fact, it depends only
on the a priori probability of the pixel class. Therefore, this upper
bound is fulfilled for those methods that rely on Bayes' rule using
the mixture of two normal distributions.
4.3. Distribution and convergence of the transition proportion
In the previous section, we determined the upper bound d of
the difference between thresholds with different transition pro-
portions; see (20). To refine this upper bound, we studied the
theoretical and empirical distribution of w in this section.
The shape of the transition-proportion histogram depends on
two factors:
(1) The proximity of background pixels to foreground pixels:
if a background pixel is far from the foreground pixels, then the
positive transition set tends to be under sampled since the
pixel neighborhood barely overlaps the foreground. As a result,
the transition proportion tends to be small. To avoid this problem,
the transition method selects those pixels whose neighborhoods
have at least nþ positive and n negative transition pixels; see
Fig. 6(a).
(2) The pixel neighborhoods' size from which the transition
proportion is locally computed: the histogram converges to
jtF j=jtP j as the pixel neighborhood size converges to the image
size; see Fig. 6(b).
To explain the shapes of the transition-proportion histograms,
we studied the theoretical limits of circles and lines. The circles
represent punctuation symbols while the lines represent ink
strokes.
The equations in Table 3, derived from Fig. 7(a), establish that
the convergence value of the transition proportion depends on the
stroke width, denoted by sw, the pixel neighborhood size
(x¼ 2rþ1), and the size t of the transition neighborhood. Fig. 8(a)
shows that the average distribution of 17 handwritten images ranges
between 0.10 and 0.65 and clusters between 0.41 and 0.5, for t¼2
and xZ31. This suggests that swZ3 for the majority of the strokes
as can be visually verified. From now on, we will assume that t¼2 for
the rest of this paper.

Since we have determined experimentally and theoretically
that wþ A ½0:1;0:6 for rZ15, then we can determine by (20) that
the difference d between the normal thresholds computed with
w¼wþ and the normal threshold computed with w¼0.5 satisfies

Thus, assuming that wþ A ½0:1;0:6, the inequality in (23) is
minimized for wn  0:29 such that Dðwn;wÞ ¼ 3:23 for
wA ½0:1;0:6. Table 4 reports several values of Dðwn;wÞ.
The election of a constant for w is not straightforward because
it depends on the distribution of wþ rather than on the maximum
difference (Dðwþ ;wÞ). Taking into account the distribution of wþ ,
we analyzed the average difference between the actual normal
threshold and the estimated threshold and computed the optimal
constant wn that minimizes such an average. In the following two
subsections, we will analyze the transition proportion assuming
for discrete and continuous distributions.
4.4.1. Discrete distribution
Let us assume that wþ follows a discrete distribution. So, the
average difference for a constant w is bounded by
DðwÞo2 ∑
n
i ¼ 1
PrðW þ ¼wiÞDðwi;wÞ; ð24Þ
where PrðW þ ¼wiÞ denotes the probability of the transition
proportion of being equal to wi.
Although we do not know the distribution of the stroke widths
(sw) in DIBCO 2009 and H-DIBCO 2010, we know, by visual
inspection, that the majority of strokes fulfill swZ3. In fact, the
dominant sw appears to be four or more pixels. Nevertheless, let
us assume a discrete uniform distribution for sw¼{ 3, 4þ }, where
4þ denotes four or more pixels. Hence, DðwÞ is minimized at
wn ¼ 3=7 and at wn ¼ 1=2.
When the pixel neighborhood is not large enough, as in our
dataset, the transition proportion have to be computed according
to Table 3. In particular, for our dataset, we can underestimate the
transition proportion by assuming that the characters are longer
than 40 pixels. With this restriction, two minimums are reached at
wn ¼ 41=105 and at wn ¼ 41=90; see Table 4.
4.4.2. Continuous distribution
Similar to (24), we can derive wn when wþ follows a contin-
uous distribution in ½wl;wu. In such a case, the average difference
is bounded by
DðwÞo2
Z wu
wl
PrðW þ ¼ xÞDðx;wÞ dx: ð25Þ
For example, Fig. 8(a) shows the empirical distribution of wþ for
DIBCO 2009 and H-DIBCO 2010 images in neighborhoods of radius
r¼15. Following this distribution, we found that DðwÞ is mini-
mized at wn ¼ 41=90. Furthermore, if the radius changes to r¼100,
then wn ¼ 0:465; see Fig. 8(b).
For our database of 245 small images, Fig. 9(a) shows that the
empirical cumulative distribution of wþ is approximately uni-
formly distributed between 0.4 and 0.5, with 87.35% of the
population. Therefore, we can assume that wþ  Uð0:4;0:5Þ and,
consequently, wn ¼ 0:4502; see Table 4.
4.4.3. Standardized error rate
At this point, we have shown that replacing wþ for
wA ½0:1;0:6 yields approximately the same thresholds (74).
Moreover, the difference between the actual optimal threshold
Fig. 9. (a) Empirical distributions of the transition proportion for our database of 245 images are shown. (b) Error rates for different thresholds are shown. In green, the
minimum error rate that corresponds to t is shown. In yellow the error increments from tmer to tn. In gray (left), the error increments from tn to tnþ2. In red, the error
increments from tnþ2 to t0n and in gray (right), the error increment from t0n to t0nþ2. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure caption, the reader is referred
to the web version of this paper.)

and the threshold computed with a constant transition proportion
is less than 0.03 gray levels in the average. See the empirical
distribution column of Table 4. However, we should remark that
the difference between the error rates of these thresholds also
depends on μþ , μ , s2þ , and s2 .
To exemplify our above argument, observe Fig. 9(b), where the
minimum error rate, achieved at t, is around 14.17%. For tn and
tnþ2, the error rate increases 0.08% and 0.17%, respectively.
However, for t0
n
and t0
n
þ2, the difference between their corre-
sponding error rates is 0.72%: nine-fold the increase from 0.08%
to 0.17%.
Fig. 9(b) also shows that the increase of the error rate from tn to
tnþ2 depends on the difference between μþ and μ and the
magnitudes of s2þ and s2 . Then, we empirically determined how
the transition proportion affects the error rate when μþ , μ , s2þ ,
and s2 are accurately estimated.
In order to analyze the error rate, let us define the standardized
error rate, which maps the error rate as
Erði;wÞ ¼ Erði;wÞErmerðiÞ
ErwhiteðiÞErmerðiÞ
ð26Þ
where ErmerðiÞ is the minimum error rate of the ith image, ErwhiteðiÞ
is the error rate that corresponds to a white image (all pixels are
classified as background) in the ith image, and Erði;wÞ is the error
rate that corresponds to the normal threshold such that the
transition proportion is replaced by w.
Fluctuations of Erði;wÞ are related to the method's performance
rather than related to fluctuations of the minimum error rates in
the dataset. Hence, the standardized error rate is a more suitable
measure than the error rate measure for thresholding methods
since its mean is adjusted to the fluctuations of the minimum error
rate. Because of this, we defined our error function as
ErðwÞ ¼ 1
n
∑Erði;wÞ; ð27Þ
where n is the number of images in our database.
The measure ErðwÞ has mixed results; see Fig. 10 and Table 4.
On one hand, Erð0:4Þ ¼ 2:21% is smaller than Erðwþ Þ ¼ 2:42% and
smaller than Erð0:5Þ ¼ 2:55%; see Fig. 10(a). On the other hand, the
conditional pairwise comparison indicates a triangle ranking,
where w¼wþ outperforms w¼0.5, w¼0.5 outperforms w¼0.4,
and w¼0.4 outperforms w¼wþ ; see Fig. 10(b).
The mixed results in Fig. 10 suggest that the election of a
constant for w between 0.3 and 0.5 has little influence on the error
rate. The means are marginally different and their conditional
pairwise comparisons are around 50%, which indicates similar
performance.
5. Evaluations
As a complement to this research, we conducted two evalua-
tions. The first evaluation assesses the transition method's efficiency
Fig. 10. (a) In the thick solid line, the graph of the standardized error rate is depicted. Its upper and lower bounds of the interval of confidence (95%) are shaded in blue and
red, respectively. The gray rectangle is the interval of confidence (95%) for w¼wþ . (b) Conditional pairwise comparison of standardized error rate are shown. The percent in
the bar entitled w¼wþ vs w¼0.5 refers to PrðEr ðwþ Þ4Er ð0:5Þ j Er ðwþ ÞaEr ð0:5ÞÞ; while, the right percent refers to PrðEr ðwþ ÞoEr ð0:5Þ j Er ðwþ ÞaEr ð0:5ÞÞ. The other bars
are defined in a similar manner. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure caption, the reader is referred to the web version of this paper.)

filled markers. In blue, binarization algorithms based on the transition method are shown. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure caption, the reader is

in regions of interest. The second evaluation compares the transition
method's performance with the state-of-the-art methods.
5.1. Performance measures
To evaluate the binarization method's performance, we com-
puted the F-measure (FM), recall (RE), and precision (PR):
FM¼ 2 Recall Precision

where F and B are the fore and background, respectively; and
their corresponding estimates are F̂ and B̂ . We also computed the
peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) which is a transformed measure
of the error rate (ER):
PSNR¼ 10 log 10ðERÞ where ð30Þ

where xi is the measurement of interest and μ is the mean of the

5.2. Evaluation I
Our first evaluation is designed to assess the performance of
the algorithms in an atomic manner rather than in combination
with other techniques. Hence, we compared our methods with
several thresholding methods.
In this evaluation, all the methods were globally computed and no
pre- or post-processing steps were done. In this manner, we assessed
the quality of the threshold for different types of histograms.
We tested three variants of the transition method following the
same steps but differing in gray-intensity threshold:
1. The minimum-error-rate transition, denoted by MerT.
2. The normal transition, denoted by NorT.
3. The lognormal transition, denoted by LogT.
When the transition proportion is replaced by a constant, it is
indicated by ðw¼ xÞ, where x is the constant. In these variants, the
transition set was approximated as in Section 3.2. The implemen-
tation details can be found in this paper's supplementary material.
We compared the performance of our methods, with histogram-
based methods that are related, recent, or top-ranked:
1. Otsu's threshold [42], top-ranked in [43,44].
2. Kapur's threshold [45], top-ranked in [46].
3. The minimum error thresholding (Kittler) [47], top-ranked in [48].
4. The minimum variance thresholding (Hou) [49], proposed
in 2006.
5. The valley-emphasis method (Ng) [50], proposed in 2006.
6. Li's threshold [51], proposed in 2010.
We also selected statistical algorithms where only mean and
standard deviation of gray intensities were computed:
1. Niblack's method [52], top ranked in [43].
2. Sauvola's method [37], top-ranked in [44,48,53].
Since both algorithms have parameters, we swept their parameter
domain and reported the parameter sets that attained the highest
performance for each measure. In addition to the manual para-
meter selection, we implemented two frameworks for automatic
parameters selection: Badekas and Papamarkos [54] and Ramírez-
Ortegón et al. [44]. These frameworks were applied to Sauvola's
and Niblack's and we reported the following combinations:
1. Badekas and Papamarkos's framework applied to Niblack's
threshold, denoted by BPþNib.
2. Badekas and Papamarkos's framework applied to Sauvola's
threshold, denoted by BPþSau.

From our results in Fig. 11, we have four comments:
1. The transition method is moderately affected if the transition
proportion is replaced by a constant. This supports our obser-
vations in Section 4.4.3, where we pointed out that the
accuracy of the means and variances of the transition sets may
considerably affect the error rate.
2. The crossed results for the normal transition methods point out
that NorT has a more balanced error between false positive and
false negatives. Observe that NorT performs better than NorT
(w¼0.5) and NorT (w¼0.4) under FM while, at the same time,
it performs the poorest under PSNR measure. In fact, NorT
reports a better recall measurement than NorT (w¼0.5) and
NorT (w¼0.4) which means that NorT (w¼0.5) and NorT
(w¼0.4) tend to underestimate the foreground.
3. The gray-intensity distributions of the positive and negative
transitions sets may not be normally distributed since LogT
outperforms NorT. A deep discussion of this is beyond the

four decimals since the values were taken from the original publication rather than calculated from the binary images.

4. Niblack's threshold slightly surpasses LogT. However, when
Niblack's method is combined with a technique for an auto-
matic parameter selection, like Badekas and Papamarkos'
method, its performance is inferior to LogT; see BPþNib.
5.3. Evaluation II
The goal of this evaluation is to show the potential of the
transition method in historical documents. We tested our algo-
rithms on (H-)DIBCO's benchmark 2009–2013 whereby we can
compare our methods with the-state-of-the-art methods.
To deal with historical documents, we implemented the local
version of our previous thresholds: ROIþLogTþBR and ROIþ
NorTþBR.
The inputs and outputs of these binarizations are pre-processed
and post-processed for diverse techniques localizing the regions of
interest, removing small connected components, restoring con-
tours, and removing binary artifacts [56]. For further reference,
details of these processes are given in the supplementary material.
We also implemented four other versions: LogT, ROIþLogT,
ROIþNiblackþBR, and ROIþOtsuþBR. The former two methods
are implemented in a similar manner to ROIþLogTþBR. However,
no pre- or post-process was done for LogT, and no post-process
was done for ROIþLogT. The latter two are identical to
ROIþLogTþBR but replacing the threshold given by LogT with,
respectively, Niblack's and Otsu's thresholds. In this manner, we
can observe how pre- and post-processes enhance the final
binary image.
Tables 5 and 6 report the measurements of each test image in

 Taken from the original papers: methods of DIBCO 2009 [11],
methods of H-DIBCO 2010 [12], Moghaddam's [22] and Shi's [21]
methods.
We summarized our results by computing the measures by the
total of pixels from the images of all (H-)DIBCO's competitions: the
true positive, the true negative, the false positive, and the false
negative pixels from all images were counted and, then, both FM
and PSNR were computed. Table 12 only reports those methods
and their binary images of all the DIBCO's competitions.
In terms of measure means, Tables 5 and 6 show that
ROIþLogTþBR is slightly better than ROIþNorTþBR. Even so,
the pairwise comparisons between ROIþLogTþBR and ROIþ
NorTþBR show a ratio about 2:1 in favor of ROIþLogTþBR for
both handwritten and printed documents.
We noticed that our method's performance in (H-)DIBCO
benchmarks is correlated with the stroke width of the documents.
This may be related to the fact that in thin strokes less transition
pixels are available to compute the means and variances of gray
intensities.
Another factor that acts upon the scores of our method is the
definition of edge. We conjectured that the correlation between
performance and stroke width happens due to our edge detectors:
the edges in DIBCO's groundtruth images were constructed by a
method based on Canny's edge detector [57] while our method

relies on transition sets [28], and as a consequence, our contour
definition differs from the contour definition in DIBCO's ground-
truth images.
Note that slight contour differences may produce considerably
different FM's scores in images where the ratio of edge pixels to
foreground pixels is high, as in handwritten documents. For
example, Fig. 12 shows one of the most representative images
where edge pixels may be the cause of a low method's perfor-
mance. Observe that our binarization is visually well-defined but,
nevertheless, it scored a low FM (around 86%). In fact, the bigger
the ratio between edge pixels to foreground pixels, the poorer our
method's performance; Fig. 13 shows a correlation between the
edge proportion and FM values for the images of (H-)DIBCO 2009–
2013.
Among the other evaluated methods, Lelore's, Howe's, and Su's
(DIBCO 2011) methods have a remarkable performance. This is not
a surprise since these methods have being top-ranked through out
DIBCO's editions. In particular, Lelore's and Howe's perform the
best in handwritten and printed, respectively; see Table 12. All
three methods detect edges by Canny's method, as the ground-
truth generator, which is an advantage over our methods. Even so,
observe in Table 12 that our method has comparable performance
with Lelore's and Howe's method for printing documents (less
than 0.1 of difference in FM and less than 0.2 in PSNR). Moreover,
Su's (DIBCO 2011) method has a relatively low performance
according to Table 12 but, at the same time, Tables 7 and 8 report
a high performance for Su's (DIBCO 2011) method. It happens
because such tables report FM averages at the image-level rather
than at the pixel-level and, as a result, dreadful performance in
certain images is covered.
6. Conclusions
In this paper, we have analyzed the transition proportion
mathematically and experimentally for historical handwritten
images. We concluded that the influence of the transition propor-
tion on the normal transition is marginal. In concrete, we proved
that inaccurate estimations of the transition proportion led to
thresholds that differ less four or less gray levels of the actual
optimal threshold (assuming 256 gray levels).
We determined the optimal values for the transition proportion
when it was assumed to be a constant. These values depended on
the distribution of the transition proportion and some assump-
tions on the gray-intensity variances.

For documents, we determined a criterion to detect regions of
interest: pixels within regions of interest have a transition propor-
tion greater than 0.1.
We also discovered that the convergence values of the transi-
tion proportion is a function of the stroke width and the radius
of the pixel neighborhood. Hence, it can be used as a feature
to determine dominant values of the stroke width within a
document.
Our results not only have ensured the interaction of the
transition method with the transition proportion, but also have
established the mathematical bases for further research in stroke-
width estimation and in detection of regions of interest. Further-
more, our analysis of the transition proportion can be extended to
other methods based on the mixture of two normal distributions
and Bayes rule.
7. Further work
To improve our method, we will explore better fitting models
for the mixture of distributions. In particular, we will continue the
work in [55], where the authors proposed a model for the gray-
intensity distribution based on the mixture of three distributions
(two normal distributions and another that is not normal).
Furthermore, in [55] was introduced the concept of frontier
pixels which are pixels that contain both fore and background
regions. This concept is strongly related to edge pixels and,
consequently, it can be used to formulate transition functions that
identify transition sets more accurately. Note that, in this paper, a
transition pixel is considered to be entirely contained within the
foreground (positive transition) or within the background (nega-
tive transition). Hence, frontier pixels were not modeled properly.
