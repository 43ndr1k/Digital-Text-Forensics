Abstract
Analysis  of  a  corpus  of  tens  of  thousands  of  blogs  – 
incorporating  close  to  300  million  words  –  indicates 
significant differences in writing style and content between 
male  and  female  bloggers  as  well  as  among  authors  of 
different  ages.  Such  differences  can  be  exploited  to 
determine  an  unknown  author’s  age  and  gender  on  the 
basis of a blog’s vocabulary.
Introduction  
The  increasing  popularity  of  publicly  accessible  blogs 
offers  an  unprecedented  opportunity  to  harvest 
information from texts authored by hundreds of thousands 
of different  authors.  Conveniently,  many of these  blogs 
include  formatted  demographic  information  provided by 
the authors. (While much of this information is no doubt 
spurious,  it  is  reasonable  to  assume  that  most  is  not.) 
Moreover,  the  blog  genre  imposes  no  restrictions  on 
choice of topic. Thus, we can exploit this rich data set to 
begin to answer the following question:  How do content 
and writing style vary between male and female bloggers 
and  among  bloggers  of  different  ages?  How  much 
information  can  we  learn  about  somebody  simply  by 
reading  a  text  that  they have  authored?  These  are  very 
basic questions  that  are  both  of fundamental  theoretical 
interest and of great practical consequence in forensic and 
commercial domains.
In  the  following  sections,  we will  describe  our  corpus, 
highlight  the significant  differences in  writing  style and 
content among different populations, and show the extent 
to which such differences can be exploited to determine an 
unknown  author’s  age  and  gender.  These  differences 
confirm  findings  reported  earlier  with  regard  to age [8] 
and  gender  [1,5,7]  on  the  basis  of  much  more  limited 
corpora, and introduce many new findings. 
The Corpus
For  the  purpose  of  this  study,  we  reviewed  all  blogs 
 Copyright © 2005, American Association for Artificial Intelligence 
 (www.aaai.org). All rights reserved.
accessible  from  blogger.com  one  day  in  August  2004, 
downloading  each  one  that  included  author-provided 
indication  of  gender  and  at  least  200  appearances  of 
common  English  words.  The  full  corpus  thus  obtained 
included over 71,000 blogs.
Each  downloaded  blog  includes  all  blog  entries  from 
inception to the harvesting date. Formatting within a blog 
entry was ignored;  in  particular,  we did  not  distinguish 
between  quotes  within  a  blog  and  the  text  of  the  blog 
itself.  Some  of  these  blogs  include  additional  text  in 
languages other than English;  this text is ignored for our 
purposes.  Some  of  the  blogs  included  author-provided 
indication of age.
Figure  1  shows  the  distribution  of  blogs  over  various 
categories for age and gender. Given the large number of 
blogs in  our  corpus,  it  is  reasonable to assume that  our 
corpus reflects the actual distribution of all blogs for these 
attributes. Note that among bloggers up to the age of 17, 
females are a distinct majority (63%), but among bloggers 
above the age of 17, females are a minority (47%).

Table 1 Blogs Distribution over Age and Gender
To prevent bias, we created a sub-corpus consisting of an 
equal number of male and female blogs in each age group, 
by randomly discarding  surplus  documents  in  the  larger 
category. This left us with a total of 37,478 blogs (the sum 
of the minima over the various age brackets), comprising 
1,405,209  blog  entries  and  295,526,889  words.  All 
statistics reported in  this  paper  are taken  from this  sub-
corpus. 
DISTINGUISHING FEATURES
In this section we consider differences in male and female 
blogging and differences among bloggers of different ages. 
Broadly  speaking,  two  different  kinds  of  potential 
distinguishing  features  can  be  considered:  style-related 
and content-related.
For our purposes, we consider three types of style-related 
features:  selected  parts-of-speech,  function  words  and 
blog-specific  features  such  as  “blog  words”  and 
hyperlinks.  (Blog  words  are  neologisms  –  such  as  lol,  
haha and ur – that appear with high frequency in the blog 
corpus.)
Our content-related features are simple content words, as 
well  as  special  classes  of  words  taken  from  the 
handcrafted  LIWC  [9]  categories,  as  will  be  described 
below.
Style-based features 
For  each  of  these  features,  we measured  the  frequency 
with  which  it  appears  in  the  corpus per  gender  per  age 
bracket. For simplicity of presentation, we show (Table 2 
– see end of paper) frequencies per gender and age bracket 
(13-17 [=10s]; 23-27 [=20s]; 33-42 [=30s]) of a variety of 
parts of speech as well as of hyperlinks and blog words. 
Average number of words per post is also shown. 
First, note that for each age bracket, female bloggers use 
more  pronouns  and  assent/negation  words  while  male 
bloggers use more articles and prepositions. Also, female 
bloggers use blog words far more than do male bloggers, 
while male bloggers use more hyperlinks than do female 
bloggers.  All  of  this  confirms  and  extends  findings 
reported  earlier  in  [1,5,7]  and  lends  support  to  the 
hypothesis  that  female writing  tends  to emphasize  what 
Biber [3] calls “involvedness”, while male writing tends to 
emphasize “information”.
Another  point  to  note  is  that  prepositions  and  articles, 
which are used more frequently by male bloggers, are used 
with increasing frequency by all bloggers as they get older. 
Conversely,  pronouns,  assent/negation  words  and  blog 
words,  which  are  used  more  frequently  by  female 
bloggers, are used with decreasing frequency as bloggers 
get older. In short, the very same features that distinguish 
between male and female blogging style also distinguish 
between older and younger blogging style. (Recall that the 
corpus  is  entirely  balanced  for  gender  within  each  age 
bracket.)
Content-based features
Gender: In  Table  3,  we  show  frequency  (per  10,000 
words)  and  standard  error  –  among  male  and  female 
bloggers, respectively – for those content-based unigrams 
with  greatest  information  gain  for  gender.  The  features 
shown are the 15 words that appear at least 5000 times in 
the corpus and have highest information gain among those 
that  appear  more  frequently  among  males  and  females, 
respectively. 
The  differences  shown  here  are  all  significant  at 
p<.00001.
These  differences  further  suggest  a  pattern  of  more 
“personal” writing by female bloggers than male bloggers. 
This is further  borne out in Table 4, where we show the 
same  statistics  for  classes  of  words  taken  from  LIWC 
classes.
Note that LIWC does not include word classes relating to 
politics and technology. However, as indicated by Table 3 
– and as confirmed by perusal of the full frequency tables 
(too  large  to  be  shown  here)  –  male  blogging  is 
characterized  by  far  more  references  to  politics  and 
technology.
Age: In Table 5, we show we show frequency (per 10,000 
words) and standard error – among bloggers in their 10s, 
20s  and  30s,  respectively  –  for  those  content-based 
unigrams  with  greatest  information  gain  for  age.  The 
features shown are the 10 words that appear at least 5000 
times  in  the  corpus  and  have  highest  information  gain 
among those that appear more frequently among 10s, 20s 
and 30s, respectively. 
In Table 6, we show the same statistics for the same LIWC 
word classes considered above.
Taken together, Tables 5 and 6 tell the story of the lives of 
the class of people who have the resources to write blogs. 
Teenage concern with friends and mood swings gives way 
to the indulgences of college life and  then  eventually to 
marriage, its attendant financial concerns and an interest 
in  politics.  It  should  be noted that  the  full  list  of word 
frequencies broken down by age indicates that  almost all 
words increase or decrease monotonically with age. (The 
few exceptions – shown in Tables 5 and 6 – involve a peak 
among 20s in concern with issues closely tied to student 
life  and  a  sharp  temporary  decrease among  20s in  talk 
about  family  life.)  Interestingly,  in  almost  all  cases 
(exceptions  are  sports  and  games),  words  that  increase 
monotonically with age are “male” words and those that 
decrease with age are “female” words. 
The  rapid  decline  in  use  of  words  expressing  negative 
emotions confirms earlier findings [8] on a much smaller 
corpus.

AUTOMATED AUTHOR PROFILING
While  we  have  found  significant  differences  among 
bloggers of different  ages and  genders,  the truest  test of 
the significance of these differences is the extent to which 
they enable  us  to  correctly predict  an  author’s  age  and 
gender. 
In this section, we will compare the extent to which author 
age and gender can be predicted on the basis of stylistic 
and content-based features, respectively. It should be noted 
that these classification tasks are complicated by a number 
of  special  characteristics  of  the  blog  genre.  Blogs  are 
relatively  short  and  they  often  include  copious  quoted 
material (which we do not distinguish from the rest of the 
blog).  Moreover,  we  must  consider  the  possibility  that 
some  of the  personal  profiles  provided  by bloggers  are 
bogus.
Features
For the  purposes of learning  age and  gender  classifiers, 
each  document  is  represented  as  a  numerical  vector  in 
which  each  entry represented the  frequency (normalized 
by document  length)  of a corresponding  feature in  some 
feature set. 
In  earlier  work,  a  variety of stylistic  feature  types have 
been  considered  for  authorship  attribution  problems. 
These include function words, i.e., words that are content 
independent  [6],  syntactic features [2,10],  or complexity-
based feature such as word and sentence length  [11].  In 
particular,  the combination of function words with parts-
of-speech has proved to be quite successful [1,5]. 
The  stylistic  features  that  we use  are  those  mentioned 
earlier:  parts-of-speech,  function  words,  blog words and 
hyperlinks.  There  are  502  such  stylistic  features  in  all. 
Our content features are the 1000 unigrams with highest 
information gain in the training set. 
We should at  least note the obvious: blogs contain other 
clues  to  bloggers’  age  and  gender,  namely,  blogger-
provided profile information, as well as more subtle clues, 
such as choice of formatting template and color and use of 
emoticons and other  non-lexical features.  We do not use 
this information, although it is, in fact, quite useful [4]. 
Learning Algorithm
We use the learning algorithm Multi-Class Real Winnow 
(MCRW) to learn models that classify blogs according to 
author gender and age, respectively. Since this algorithm 
is not well known, we describe it briefly.
For each class, ci, i=1,…,m,  w
i
 is a weight vector <w
i
1,…
,w
i
n>, where n  is the size of the feature set.  Each w
i
j,  is 
initialized to 1. Training examples are randomly ordered 
and processed one at a time. For a training example, x = 
<x1,…,xn>,  let ct be the actual  class of  x and  let  co (the 
“output” class) be argmaxi x*wi. Then, if t o, we update as≠  
follows:
wtj  wtj (1+βxj)
woj  woj /(1+βxj)
where β is a positive learning constant.
We  run  repeated  training  cycles,  randomly  re-ordering 
examples after each cycle. After each ten cycles, we check 
the number of correctly classed training examples. If this 
number has diminished, we backtrack. If no improvement 
is found after five rounds of ten cycles each, the algorithm 
is terminated.
For  learning  problems  of  the  scale  we  consider  here, 
MCRW is much more efficient  than  SVM and we have 
found that it yields comparable results on a vast number of 
text categorization problems.
Gender Results
Accuracy results  of 10-fold cross-validation  experiments 
on  classifying  test  documents  according  to  gender  are 
shown on the left side of Figure 1.
The  results  for  gender  using  style-related  features  are 
roughly consistent  with those found in  earlier  studies on 
much  smaller  corpora  of fiction  and  non-fiction  writing 
[1,5].  It  is  interesting  to  note  that,  despite  the  strong 
stereotypical  differences  in  content  between  male  and 
female  bloggers  seen  above,  stylistic  differences  remain 
more telling than  content  differences. Using all features, 
we obtain accuracy of 80.1%.
Age Results
Age  experiments  were  run  on  the  three  categories 
considered above: 10s (13-17), 20s (23-27) and 30s (33-
42).  We  used  these  categories  –  omitting  intermediate 
ones – to permit  clear  differentiation,  particularly given 
the fact that many of the blogs we used had been active for 
several years. 
It  should  be noted  that  simply predicting  majority class 
(10s) would yield accuracy of 43.8%, so this can be taken 
as a plausible baseline for the age experiment. Results are 
shown on the right side of Figure 1. The confusion matrix 
is shown in Table 7.

For  age,  content  proves to be slightly more  useful  than 
style, but – as in gender – the combination is most useful. 
The  confusion  matrix  indicates  that,  using  content  and 
style features together,  10s are distinguishable from 30’s 
with accuracy above 96% and distinguishing 10s from 20s 
is also achievable with accuracy of 87.3%. Many 30s are 
mis-classed as 20s, however, yielding overall accuracy is 
76.2%
CONCLUSIONS
We have assembled a large corpus of blogs labeled for a 
variety  of  demographic  attributes.  This  large  sample 
permits  us  insight  into  the  demographic  distribution  of 
bloggers.  We  have  found  that  teenage  bloggers  are 
predominantly  female,  while  older  bloggers  are 
predominantly  male.  Moreover,  within  each  age  group, 
male and female bloggers blog about different thing and 
use different blogging styles. 
Male  bloggers  of  all  ages  write  more  about  politics, 
technology  and  money  than  do  their  female  cohorts. 
Female  bloggers  discuss  their  personal  lives  –  and  use 
more personal writing style – much more than males do. 
Furthermore, for bloggers of each gender, a clear pattern 
of differences in  content  and  style over age is  apparent. 
Regardless  of  gender,  writing  style  grows  increasingly 
“male”  with  age:  pronouns  and  assent/negation  become 
scarcer, while prepositions and determiners become more 
frequent. Blog words are a clear hallmark of youth, while 
the  use  hyperlinks  increases  with  age.  Content  also 
evolves with age in ways that could have been anticipated.
The stylistic  and  content  differences we have found are 
each  sufficient  to  permit  reasonably accurate  automated 
classification  according  to  gender  and  age  bracket  , 
respectively. In each case, the combination of stylistic and 
content features offers the best classification accuracy.
Those  who  are  interested  in  automatically  profiling 
bloggers for commercial purposes would be well served by 
considering  additional  features  –  which  we deliberately 
ignore  in  this  study – such  as author  self-identification. 
The results reported here are relevant for cases where such 
features are unavailable or unreliable and for establishing 
a  lower  bound  on  achievable  accuracy  even  where 
additional information is available. In addition, we believe 
that the learned models obtained in this work can be used 
to identify some cases in which bloggers have deliberately 
provided bogus profile information.
