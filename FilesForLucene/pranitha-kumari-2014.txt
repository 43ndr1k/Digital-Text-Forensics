Abstract—The use of internet in India is 
increasing day by day and availability of information 
in Indian languages on the web is also increasing. So 
there is a need to classify the web data to improve the 
search results. Research is going on topic-based text 
classification but, the genre (non-topical) based web 
page classification for Telugu web pages is so far not 
considered. This work attempts to identify the web 
genres in Telugu language.  In this paper, three web 
genres were identified from the Telugu language web 
pages based on the social acceptance and 
communicative purpose i.e. discourse functionality. 
Syllable extraction algorithm to extract character n-
gram features is proposed. The classification was 
performed using SVM, Naive Bayes and Random 
forest classifiers. The classification results obtained 
show that the proposed algorithm gave better 
performance in terms of F-measure and accuracy.  
Keywords: Telugu web genres; genre identification; 
genre classification; syllable extraction; character n-
gram features. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
As a result of fast growth of World Wide Web, 
web data is exponentially increasing. Nowadays, 
most of the search engines are topic based search 
engines. Lot of research has been done and 
techniques have been proposed to improve the 
quality of search results for topic based search 
engines. E.g. Retrieval query about a certain topic 
such as “Microsoft” gets many documents. These 
documents belong to different genres such as 
company homepage, product specification, product 
advertisement and review of a certain product 
Santini M [7]. In topic based search engine the 
precision is less for the above example. So there is 
a need to improve the search results by using 
genres. 
Genre means form or kind. Kwasnik and 
Crowston [9] defined genre as interactive function, 
expected content, the notions of document form 
and the notion of social approval. The utility of a 
genre counts on how well it serves a user make out 
web pages. Finn et al. [8] describe genre based on 
type of the document. 
Web genre identification for English web pages 
is an ongoing research. A very few web genre 
corpuses for English web pages exists whereas web 
genres for Indian language does not exists. In this 
paper, a model for identification and classification 
of web genres in Telugu web pages and an 
algorithm for syllable extraction from Telugu web 
pages is proposed. 
Mainly three types of scripts are used to 
represent the languages in the world, such as 
Roman Script (E.g. English), Syllabic or 
Alphasyllabary (Abugida(E.g. Telugu), Abjad(E.g. 
Arabic)), Syllabary or Logographic(E.g Chinese 
language). In a true syllabic script, there is no 
regular written similarity between characters that 
share a common consonant or vowel sound. Where 
each character or glyph in abugida denotes a 
syllable but glyphs are related to sounds. 
The alphabet of different languages is having 
unique codes that are present in the Unicode set. 
Unicode from 0C00 to 0C7F are allocated for 
Telugu syllables. Unicode Transformation Format 
(UTF) is the universal character code standard to 
represent character sets. UTF-8 is an alternative 
coded representation and maintains compatibility 
with ASCII [6]. 
The web pages in Telugu language are 
transliterated into an orthographic form using one 
of the standard forms which the system can 
understand. WX notation is used to transliterate the 
Telugu text in UTF-8 and each Telugu syllable is 
represented using this notation. The WX notation 
for Telugu alphabet is shown in TABLE I.

II. RELATED WORK 
Web page genre classification is a technique to 
filter online search results. In order to classify web 
pages by genre, it is necessary to identify required 
features to characterize web genres. Crowston et al.  
[10] carried a study of 100 Web pages, anticipating 
for emergent and reproduced genres. Crowston 
observed that examining web usage through genres 
was useful, and urged web site designers to take 
user’s prospects about known genres into 
consideration. 
Genre is a non-topical descriptor, very few 
genre corpora are available so far. There are no 
conventions for genres, Georg Rehm et al. [11] 
discussed about reference corpus of web genres to 
evaluate the identification of web genres. Web 
genres can be identified based on layout of the web 
page, form, type, discourse functionality, 
usefulness and communicative purpose etc.  KI-04 
corpus was developed by Meyer et al. [12] based 
on web genre usefulness, it consisting of 8 genres. 
7-Genre corpus consisting of 1,400 English web 
pages as built in early 2005, comprising seven 
genres identified by Santini M. reported in [15]. 
Mitja Luštrek and Andrej Bratko, constructed a 
collection of 20 genre corpus and is described in 
Vidulin et al. [16]. 20 Genre corpus allows multiple 
labels to be assigned to one web page. Home pages 
and non-home pages are distinguished in Alistair 
Kennedy et al. [13] and classified them as personal 
home page, corporate home page and 
organizational home page genres respectively. Kim 
et al. [14] concentrated on PDF documents and a 
six genre collection. 
Generally, the features used to represent web 
page in web page genre classification are of 
different types such as bag-of-words, part-of-
speech tags, various punctuation symbols, n-grams 
and function words. Document level features such 
as: sentence length, number of words and word 
length are used as feature set. 
Combined stemming approach (CSA) is 
proposed in K. Pranitha Kumari et al. [17] to 
extract root words and genre relevant words. 
Random Forest machine learning algorithm was 
used on 7-Genre corpus for classification. To 
identify home pages on the Web Kennedy et al. 
[13] used features as triple: content, form and 
functionality. The n-gram features can reduce 
problems derived from typographical errors and 
spelling mistakes done by humans [18]. Byte n-
grams by Mason J. in [19], and the combination of 
bag of words, genre relevant words, Part-of-speech 
(POS) tags and HTML tags by Santini M. [15] 
were considered as features and genre classification 
was performed by using SVM classifier. Character 
n-grams of length 2 to 8 were used and genre 
classification was performed by using SVM 
classifier in K. Pranitha Kumari et al. [20]. 
Telugu is a syllabic language. A detailed 
analysis on canonical structure of Telugu text has 
been carried out by Pratap et al.[21]. A zone 
separation algorithm for Telugu text and the basic 
character model of Telugu Script to extract the 
features from Telugu text is proposed by Sastry et 
al. [25]. 
A transliteration model for Indian languages to 
convert UTF to WX notation and WX notation to 
UTF has been implemented by Rohit Gupta et al. 
[23]. P Majumder et al. [1] characterized Telugu 
web pages by n-grams to identify the languages 
126 2014 First International Conference on Networks & Soft Computing
 
presented in the document. To improve the search 
performance of information retrieval on Telugu 
language Ramakrishna et al. [24] used various 
indexing techniques. 
III. IDENTIFICATION OF TELUGU WEB 
GENRES 
The web page collection consisting of 150 web 
pages used in this work was downloaded during the 
year 2013 from different Telugu web sites such as 
Andhra jyothi, surya, blogillu etc. Three genres 
were identified namely TelArticles, TelBlog and 
TelNews from the collection and each genre is 
assigned 50 web pages. The genres were identified 
by five annotators. The annotation is based on the 
discourse functionality and communicative purpose 
of the web pages. TABLE II shows the annotation 
results. 
 
The annotation results shown in TABLE II 
describes that the annotator has given single label 
to each web page and some web pages were not 
labeled. The average of all annotations for 
TelArticles genre is 47 web pages and the 
percentage obtained is 94%, for TelBlog genre is 
49 web pages and the percentage obtained is 98% 
and for TelNewsgenre is 46 web pages and the 
percentage obtained is 92%. The annotation results 
were verified by using classification algorithms. 
IV. N-GRAM REPRESENTATION OF 
TELUGU WEB GENRES 
An n-gram representation of web page is 
language independent [1][2][3]. An n-gram 
approach can be applicable to data such as audio 
and DNA [4][5]. Text preprocessing is not required 
in n-gram approach, so it removes the use of 
taggers, parsers and stemmers in the feature 
selection, and also prevents the use of any other 
language-dependent and non-trivial NLP tools.  
Telugu language is syllabic language where 
each syllable is a collection of one or more glyphs.  
Each glyph has a unique code known as Unicode. 
The characters of different languages have Unicode 
that are present in the Unicode set. Unicode 
ranging from 0C00 to 0C7F are allocated for 
Telugu characters in [6]. In this paper, character n-
gram method is used to represent web pages. 
Character n-gram of length ‘k’ has ‘k’ syllables. To 
extract n-gram features of Telugu web pages it is 
necessary to extract syllables from web pages.

A. Syllable Extraction and Decomposition 
The units of writing system are syllables 
(aksharas), which are fundamentally in the form of 
C*V, where C denotes a consonant and V denotes a 
vowel. The syllable is formed using a canonical 
code structure, given by (C(C)) CV format. The 
possible decomposition of syllables is in the form 
of V, CV, CCV, CCCV, C, CC, and CCC. The 
syllable extraction algorithm is proposed to extract 
syllables based on the decomposition of syllables.  
The detailed algorithm is given in Fig. 1. The 
proposed algorithm considers the canonical code 
structure along with halanth, special signs such as 
chandrabindu, anusvara and visarga. The proposed 
algorithm uses internal encoding of Telugu which 
is Unicode ranging from 0C00-0C7F.

• If vi followed by si, then vi U si is a syllable.  
– Consonant Unicode c1,c2,.............cn  C  
• If ci followed by 0020  or cj, then ci is a syllable (where 
0020 is space). 
• If ci followed by Halant h followed  by cj followed by  
vsi  followed by ck , then ci U h U cj U vsi is a syllable. 
• If ci followed by Halant h followed  by cj followed by 
si followed by ck , then ci U h U cj U si  is a syllable. 
• If ci followed by Halant h followed  by cj followed by  
vsi followed  by si followed by ck, then  ci U h U cj U 
vsi U si is a syllable. 
• If ci followed by vsi then ci U vsi is a syllable 
• If ci followed by  vsi followed  by si, then ci U vsi U si is 
a syllable.  
• If ci followed by si, then ci U si is a syllable.

V. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP 
A. Corpus 
The experiments were carried out on 3-web 
genre data collection consisting of 150 Telugu web 
pages. The 3-genre corpus as shown in TABLE III is 
a balanced corpus in which each genre is having 50 
web pages and the genres are labeled as 
TelArticles, TelBlog and TelNews.  
B. Feature Extraction and Selection  
The character n-gram features were extracted 
using the syllable extraction algorithm described in 
Fig. 1.  N-grams in Telugu were transliterated to 
English using the WX notations represented in 
TABLE I. Since the WEKA [22] machine learning 
algorithms does support non-roman languages. The 
CFSubsetEval was used for selecting the features to 
reduce the dimensionality of feature set. 
C. Classification of Genres 
The classification was performed on the 3-
genre corpus and three machine learning 
classification algorithms such as Support Vector 
Machine (SVM) classifier, Naive Bayes classifier 
and Random Forest classifier were used for the 
classification process. The SVM method is a 
supervised machine learning method which 
performs classification by constructing an N-
dimensional hyper plane that optimally separates 
the data. The vectors near the hyper plane are the 
support vectors. The Random forest classifier is an 
ensemble supervised machine learning classifier. It 
is one of the most accurate learning algorithms 
available. The classifier performance measures 
used in this work are precision, recall, F-measure 
and accuracy. Precision is the number of correctly 
classified true positive instances by the number of 
instances labeled by the system as positive. Recall 
is the number of correctly classified true positive 
instances divided by the number of positive 
instances in the data. F-measure is the harmonic 
mean of precision and recall. Accuracy is the ratio 
of correctly classified web pages and the total 
number of web pages in the collection.

D. Result Analysis 
The classification results obtained in this paper 
are shown in TABLE IV and TABLE V. TABLE V 
depicts SVM, Naive Bayes and Random Forest 
classifier performances in terms of precision, recall 
and F-measure of three Telugu web genres. TABLE 
IV shows SVM, Naive Bayes and Random Forest 
classifier results in terms of accuracy and F-
measure of three Telugu web genres. For the genre 
TelArticles the obtained Precision, recall and F-
measure is 100%, the reason is many unique tri-
grams are there in the TelArticle web pages 
compared with the other two genres. 
VI. CONCLUSION  
A Telugu web page genre identification process 
is introduced. The 3-web genre collection has been 
built following the criteria of discourse 
functionality. Syllable extraction algorithm to 
extract n-gram features from Telugu web pages is 
proposed. N-grams are much less sensitive to 
OCR-generated errors. When dealing with 
languages that require non-trivial feature 
extraction, n-grams provide a language-
independent feature extraction technique. The web 
pages and genres were represented by character 3-
grams. Three Telugu web genres were identified by 
following the method of annotation. SVM, Naïve 
Bayes and Random forest classifiers were used for 
classification. The classification results obtained 
show that the proposed algorithm gave better 
performance in terms of F-measure and accuracy. 
Automatic identification of Telugu web page 
genres can be considered as a future work.
