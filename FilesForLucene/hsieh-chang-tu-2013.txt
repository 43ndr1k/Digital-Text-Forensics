Abstract 
 
Dream of the Red Chamber (DRC), written in the 18th century, is among the 
greatest Chinese classic novels.  Indeed, so many studies have been devoted to this 
work that the term Redology was created to designate this field of research. (The 
2,200-page book by Pan 1974 described earlier works in Redology.)  DRC has 120 
chapters.  In 1921, Hu Shi (胡適) provided solid evidence to show that the first 80 
chapters were written by Cao Xueqin (曹雪芹) based on his life.  He also attributed 
the remaining 40 chapters to Gao E (高鶚) (Hu 1921).  While the first conclusion is 
commonly accepted, the second is still not settled. 
Researchers have also used statistical methods to study this problem.  They 
usually use certain pre-defined linguistic features, usually a set of function words, to 
check whether the feature frequencies in the first 80 chapters are significantly 
different from the last 40.  Interestingly, however, people came to different 
conclusions when different features were chosen. 
 In this paper we propose a text-mining approach to the DRC author attribution 
problem.  We define a mining function to find terms that clearly show discrepancies 
between the two corpuses.  Some of the terms are semantic in nature, thus avoiding 
the pitfalls with the more syntactic function words approach.  In addition to 
supporting the claim that the first 80 chapters and the last 40 were written by different 
authors, a somewhat surprising side result is the evidences that show Chapters 64 and 
67, two chapters missing from the oldest existing edition, could also have been 
written by someone other than Cao Xueqin. 
 
1. Introduction 
Authorship attribution is a well-researched subject. Brinegar (1963) used word

length as the text feature to conclude that the 10 Quintus Curtius Snodgrass letters 
were not written by Mark Twain.  Thisted and Efron (1986) adopted a model from 
ecological studies to infer that a newly-discovered nine-stanza poem was written by 
William Shakespeare.  Recent approaches, that usually assume that the contexts 
being compared are different, make use of most frequent words and clustering 
analysis to identify the most likely author (Peng and Hengartner 2001, Burrows 2002, 
Hoover 2004, Malyutov 2006, Stamatatos 2009, Jockers and Witten 2010). 
A well-known author attribution problem in Chinese literature is the author of the 
last 40 chapters of the novel Dream of the Red Chamber.  Past stylistic studies lead 
to contradictory conclusions due to different feature selections and experiment 
designs.  Karlgren (1952), Chan (1986), and He (2002) concluded that the entire 
DRC was written by the same person, while Zhao and Chen (1975), Yu (1998), and 
Yang (2003) showed significant differences between the first 80 and the last 40 
chapters. 
Most of these work began from choosing certain linguistic features (usually 
function words).  A hypothesis testing method is then deployed to check whether the 
frequency distributions of features in the first 80 chapters are significantly different 
from those in the last 40.  Yang (2003) used a different approach.   They first 
partitioned DRC into 12 documents, each with 10 chapters.  Instead of using 
pre-defined words, they designed a simple function that used the frequencies of 
unigrams to associate similarities of each pair of the 12 documents.  They found 
strong similarities in the first 2 documents (containing Chapters 1-20), the next 6 
documents (Chapters 21-80), and the final 4 (Chapters 81-120), and thus concluded 
that the final 40 chapters were written by a different author.   However, using the 
same reasoning, one could also conclude that the first 20 chapters and the middle 60 
were written by different authors. 
 
2. Our text-mining approach 
We propose a text-mining approach to the DRC author attribution problem.  
Instead of choosing a pre-defined set of words, we design a mining function to 
generate candidate words. In addition to term frequencies, we also consider another 
important factor: the number of chapters in which a term appears. 
2.1 The edition question 
The first question is to choose a proper edition.  DRC has scores of editions, the 
earliest of which (dated 1754) contains merely 16 chapters, and the second, gengchen 
3 
 
edition (庚辰本) of 1760, has 78 chapters (Chapters 1-80 except 64 and 67).  The 
earliest existing version with 120 chapters appeared in 1791, edited by Cheng 
Weiyuan and Gao E.  The full text we chose was the one provided by YuanZe 
University,1 which is the closest to the earliest editions.  As a side note, since the 
gengchen edition has only 78 chapters, we need to decide whether Chapters 64 and 67 
should be included in our study.   We finally decided to leave them in.  Our 
analysis actually leads to the conclusion that these two chapters were written by 
someone else. 
2.2 The text-mining function 
Regarding each chapter as one document, we use A and B to denote the corpuses 
of the first 80 chapters and the last 40 respectively.  Thus |A|=80 and |B|=40.  We 
use td to mean that the term t occurs in document d.  Let Dt={d: td, dD} be the 
subset of D which contains term t.  We call |Dt| the document frequency of t in D.  
Given a term t and a document set D, we define the average document frequency of t 
in D to be pt(D)= |Dt|/|D|.  Intuitively, it means that on the average any document in 
D has probability pt(D) to contain the term t. 
We define the text-mining function as follow: 
where a constant k is added to avoid the case f(t)= when pt(A) or pt(B) equals 0. We 
set k to be 0.02 in our experiments.  To better understand how this function works, 
consider the case that pt(A)  pt(B) and k=0.  Then f(t)= pt(A)/ pt(B) and a bigger f(t) 
has the higher ratio of pt(A) to pt(B).  Thus a high-scored f(t) means that the average 
document frequency of term t in A is significantly different from that in B.   
 The top 5 unigrams and top 10 bigrams obtained through f(t) are given in Table 1.  
We remark that we studied the top 30 unigrams and bigrams, and they all showed

similar behavior. 
 2.3 Some findings 
We now briefly discuss some of our findings.  The top-scored unigram ma (嬤) 
occurs only in the form of mama (嬤嬤) which we shall discuss later.  The unigram li 
(裡) is interchangeable with another li (裏), which means that this word might have 
been replaced during transcribing and should not be considered.  However, it is 
interesting to remark that while li (裡) appears 109 times in the first 80 chapters (none 
in the last 40), 54 times of which are in Chapter 67 alone!  This strongly suggests 
that the current Chapter 67 (missing in the gengchen edition) was later added by 
another person. The frequency distribution of the third unigram ma (嗎), a common 
function word, coincides with the experiments of Zhao and Chen (1975).  Note that 
it only appeared once in the first 80 chapters.  After comparing the text with some 
other editions, we suspect that the single paragraph containing ma (嗎) in the first 80 
chapters was not written by Cao Xueqin. 
The bigrams reveal even more insight.  First consider qizhi (豈知, which does 
not have clear semantics by itself), which occurs in 24 chapters in corpus B but none 
in corpus A.  Assuming that both A and B are written by the same author, and that the 
probability of this term to occur in a chapter is 24/40=0.6.  Then the probability that 
qizhi is not found in text A is (1-0.6)80=1.46*10-32, an incredibly small number.  
Furthermore, the bigram weizhi (未知) appears in 31 chapters of the last 40, and the 
only chapter of the first 80 in which it appears is Chapter 64, another chapter missing 
in the gengchen edition.  This provides another evident that both chapters (64 and 67) 
were added later by someone else.  The third example, the bigram mama (嬤嬤, a 
respectful title given to an elder wet nurse) occurs in 34 out of the first 80 chapters but 
none in the last 40.  There are many mama’s in DRC.  They all conspicuously 
disappeared after Chapter 80.  The 9th bigram quxiao (取笑, poking fun) also 
appeared in 30 of the first 80 chapters but totally disappeared afterwards. 
2.4  The three-author question? 
Recall that Yang (2003) also did not chose function words a priori and found 
strong discrepancies between Chapter 1-20, 21-80, and 81-120. Thus, if one is to 
conclude from their studies that the last 40 chapters were written by a different author, 
one may also need to declare that the first 80 chapters were also written by two 
different authors. 
To make sure that our method does not pose similar problems, we ran the same 
experiment between the texts of Chapters 1-20 and Chapters 21-80.  Not surprisingly, 
5 
 
we found some unigrams and bigrams that appear in one corpus but not in the other.  
A careful analysis, however, shows that they are mostly event-dependent, involving 
persons or places that appeared later in the story or died.  Considering that there are 
more than 400 characters in DRC, such event-dependent differences are expected. 
3. Discussions 
Our studies support the thesis that the last 40 chapters of DRC were written by 
someone other than Cao Xueqin.  It also shows that Chapters 64 and 67 may also 
have been written by another person.  Furthermore, the text-mining method we used 
offers a different approach to the author attribution problem. 
A common textual analysis approach is to use function words to detect 
discrepancies in different texts.  For instance, in Chinese ma (嗎) as a function word 
has the equivalent me (麼).  Suppose one uses ma as a proof that an article is not 
written by a certain person, can the verdict be overturned if one uniformly replaces all 
the function word occurrences of ma by me? 
The text-mining approach proposed here is different.  Although it is also based 
on differences in word style, the words are generated by the method itself.  Take the 
term mama as an example.  Mama appeared in 34 of the first 80 chapters, and was 
used to address quite a few minor characters in the book (last appearance in Chapter 
80).  However, not only was the term completely missing from the last 40 chapters, 
so did the concept and the characters!  Such "semantic" differences seem to provide 
more solid evidence than purely syntactic ones.
