ABSTRACT
A short piano piece was prepared by undergraduate and graduate piano
students (N = 15) without guidance from their piano teachers. Temporal
parameters were analyzed in several time frames, from a phrase-to-
phrase level to an interonset interval. At a macro level, local tempo was
shown to be a crucial parameter that divided the students into two
groups that differed in their approach to a particular phrase, revealing
the degree of proficiency in terms of interpretive decisions. The
mathematical modeling of this phrase was further analyzed in terms of
the mean squared error in comparison to the nominal (technical, strict
tempo) and pianist (artistic) performance. This approach was employed
to classify the students’ performance in categories that were shown to
be more related to their proficiency level than to their academic level.
From the instrument pedagogy point of view, this research suggests
fomenting in students a critical conscious about rhythm structure and its
implications for coherence within the limits set by stylistic conventions
of western classical music.

Introduction
Variations in tempo, intensity, timbre, articulation and pitch (vibrato) constitute potentially expres-
sive characteristics of performed music. Among skilled performers, these systematically employed
expressive devices are related to the structural features of the music – or, to be precise, to the per-
former’s mental representation of the musical structures (Thompson 2009). Of the parameters
that can be explored in relation to expressivity in performance, tempo demands investigation (Hon-
ing 2009). Several aspects of tempo in performance remain unclear. For instance, the relationship
between tempo and timing has not been fully elucidated. Some propose that the duration of all per-
formed notes maintains its relative proportion when the tempo changes (Repp 1994), whereas others
suggest that tempo changes affect timing (Desain and Honing 1994; Friberg and Sundström 2002;
Timmers 2002; Honing 2005).
The effect of variations in tempo and expressivity in music performance has exploited the
advances in the computational capabilities of digital recording devices and the development of
accurate and reliable algorithms for numerical analysis (Goebl and Widmer 2009; Delgado,
Fajardo, and Molina-Solana 2011; Ramirez, Maestre, and Perez 2013). In other words, compu-
tational models have been able to express structural features and patterns embedded in the
intended expressivity. For instance, Todd (1985, 1989) proposed a mathematical model for
rubato, and Tonic and Janata (2008) proposed ways of modeling characteristics of timing in

audio signals and behavioral data to describe possibilities of different metrical levels and rhythmic
patterns. Other studies have investigated the quantification of expressive timing behaviors (i.e.
constant, slowing down, speeding up and accent; Gu and Raphael 2012) or have modeled the
manipulation of timing to express the emotional content of musical pieces (Ramirez, Maestre,
and Serra 2012).
Most investigators have focused on the performance of professional musicians (see, for
instance, Cannazza, De Poli, and Vidolin 1997) or on extracts of commercial recordings (see,
for instance, Repp 1998; Goebl, Pampalk, and Widmer 2004; Widmer et al. 2003; Dodson
2011). A few studies have investigated music major students (Johnson, Madsen, and Geringer
2012). Students’ manipulation of tempo and timing has yet to be investigated systematically in
the literature. In a previous study that involved the preparation of a short piano piece by graduate
and undergraduate students (N = 15) without help from teachers, tempo and timing were shown
to be musical parameters that affected students’ level of self-regulation in terms of artistic per-
formance (reference omitted). As an extension of this research, we focused now on students’
manipulation of temporal microstructures for the performance of a short piano piece prepared
without the assistance of their teachers. The performances were submitted to a systematic treat-
ment in terms of tempo and timing. Finally, excerpts of their performances were submitted to
mathematical treatment to extract degrees of deviations in relation to both a nominal rendition
(mechanical, strict tempo performance) and commercial recordings by a professional pianist.
This investigation aimed at classifying the degree of acceptability (or not) of their performance
within the normative and stylistic conventions of western classical music tradition, correlating
it to their academic level.
Method
Participants
Fifteen students (nine males, six females; mean age = 26 years; SD 7; range 19–45) participated in this
study. All the students belonged to applied piano majors. Data were collected at the Music Perform-
ance Laboratory at the (UFRGS). In the present paper, U represents an undergraduate (college-level
– bachelors of Music, applied Piano) student, and G represents a graduate (master’s or doctoral
degree of Music, Piano performance) student. The number following the letter represents the aca-
demic rank. The lower case alphabetic letter (a, b, c) represents different subjects. For instance,
U1b represents the second (b) undergraduate student (U) enrolled in the first year (1) among the
research participants of the same academic degree.
Material
The chosen piece, Ponteio No. 22, was extracted from a collection of 50 short pieces (prelude-like
works) by the very well-known and admired Brazilian composer Guarnieri (1907–1993).1 We
based our choice on the following criteria: (i) The 22-measure score provides clear instruction
for articulation, dynamics and tempo; (ii) its straightforward writing demands are reasonable
within the academic semester; and (iii) the character indication, ‘Triste’ (Sad), and quaver, 72,
give the piece a clearly enunciated character. Despite its mellow quality, Ponteio 22 exhibits
short polyrhythmic passages that create textural challenges. Therefore, the work provides a variety
of problem-solving situations that may depend on a student’s level of proficiency. The investigated
students were quite familiar with the idiomatic patterns common to the Brazilian music of the
period.
Sampling involved a total of 34 hours of audio- and video-taping. The interviews were transcribed
verbatim. In a complementary way, extracts of verbal data collected during the interviews that con-
tained information related to expressivity, tempo and timing were categorized.

Data collection
In a quasi-experimental set-up, music students studied Ponteio 22 without guidance from their piano
teachers for 16 weeks. Their preparation was monitored in four sessions. Each student was encour-
aged to produce his or her best results with regard to score reading accuracy and artistic expression
as early as possible in the experiment. During the first two sessions, we recorded each performer on
video and audiotape. The third session functioned as an additional opportunity to improve the qual-
ity of the students’ idealized performance. The last session involved recall stimulation by interview;
the students watched and reflected on their previous performances and chose their preferred per-
formance. At each recording session, the students recorded the performance several times until
they were satisfied. By the end of the three recording sessions, each student had at least three per-
formances from which to choose. With this approach, we avoided the assumption that the last ses-
sion would provide the best recording. It is worth mentioning that 7 out of 15 students opted for the
recording registered in the second session.
Data analysis
The audio files from the recorded performances were initially converted into .txt extension files,
and they were further analyzed by Sonic Visualiser® and Wavosaur® software. For comparison,
commercial recordings (professional pianists) and the nominal performance (strict tempo, written
in Finale Allegro® and reproduced by a computer) were also converted and adequately normalized.
Data were analyzed in terms of the average global tempo of each musical phrase. The phrase that
presented the higher degree of deviations among the subjects was further submitted to local tempo
analysis. Data were then analyzed through numerical treatment based on the root mean square
error (RMSE).
The mean squared error (MSE) is a technique used to quantify the difference between a set of
estimated values from the true value of a quantity of interest. It incorporates both the variance of
the estimator and the corresponding bias (tendency) (De Groat 1986).
The sound level measured by a sound meter is usually the root mean square of the amplitude of
the acoustic frequency/signal. Therefore, research has shown that hearing response is proportional to
the base 10 logarithm (Beranek and Ver 1992).
The squared root of the MSE yields the RMSE, which is a measure of the magnitude (positive or
negative values) of a varying quantity from a series of discrete values or for a continuous varying
function. In the present case, it is more suitable to communicate the results based on the RMSE
because it is a measure of the typical size of the error and is measured in the same units as the
data (see, for instance, Berger 1985).
Based on these considerations, the data were compared in terms of the RMSE for either the nom-
inal performance (Dp) or the professional (pianist) performances (Dpianist; both used alternatively as
a standard), as shown in Eqations (1) and (2), respectively:

where V is the mean value at each point, and Vp is the nominal value (pattern) or Vpianist at that
point. The result with lower RMSE is interpreted as better representing the variability of the obser-
vation. The closer it is to zero, the better the forecast of the model.

Results and discussion
The students’ performances were compared through the MSE, as defined in Equation (1), regarding
the nominal (strict tempo) MSEpattern and the pianist (artistic) MSEpianist performance. The lower
this value, the greater the similarity to both the nominal (strict tempo) performance and the pianist’s
performance.
As shown in Table 1, most of the students (87%) presented a slightly higher deviation from the
professional pianist’s performance and in comparison to the nominal performance. Figure 1 com-
pares the mean of the logarithm base two of the ratio of intensities of a given performance to the
standard for the students who achieved the lower MSE (U2c and D2c).
As shown in Figure 1, both students with the lower MSE (see Table 1) follow the same approach as
the pianist’s pattern. The pianist is able to play with a higher degree of technical control while sim-
ultaneously maintaining a consistent sound profile. In contrast, the students tend to be erratic in
their ability to control the intensity and produce somewhat inflated peaks and valleys. It seems
that their desire to be expressive causes outbursts, resulting in small episodes of lack of control.
As far as attitude, the students seem to be going in the right direction, but they lack the means to
produce a finished product. Furthermore, the rhythmic structure of these segments with polyrhyth-
mic figurations makes the entire passage quite tricky during the first trials.
A similar approach has been reported in the literature to evaluate performance proficiency for a
piano etude by Czerny by taking into account the following parameters: onset, velocity, duration and
tempo. Deviation from the standard (i.e. a metronome for onset time, the velocity average, the con-
stant length of duration and the requested tempo) extracted to form a spline curve were employed to
assign a score to the performance (Nonogaki et al. 2011). Stamatatos (2002) quantified the deviations
among different music performers using a discriminant analysis technique based on the parameters
of timing, articulation and dynamics. Ramirez, Maestre, and Serra (2012) proposed a computational
model, based on an evolutionary approach, that extracted note direction, onset and energy (ampli-
tude spectrum) to predict how a particular note should be played in a particular context in compari-
son to its corresponding nominal duration, which served to model expressive performance. In this
first approach of our analysis, we considered all of the music performance data in a holistic way with-
out setting any specific parameters.
To understand the content of participants’ performances, another approach of analysis was car-
ried on taking into account tempo, in macro- and micro-levels. Figure 1 shows the distribution of the

pianist’s performance.

72 bpm, which is the tempo assigned by the composer on the score. The mean tempo was calculated
by taking into account the total performance time and the total number of beats (Figure 2).

As shown in Figure 2, most of the students (13) played the piece with a range of tempi between 63
and 83 bpm. No relationship was observed between the proficiency level and bias from the requested
tempo on the score.
Guarnieri’s Ponteio No. 22 is structured in 4 phrases with a total of 16 measures centered on
F. The rich modal coloring generated by the consistently flattened sixth degree is sustained by tritone
formations driven in chromatic waves appeased only at the final chord. This piece is composed of 4
phrases (4 + 3 + 5 + 4). A more detailed analysis considered the local time spent on each of the four
phrases, as shown in Table 1. The range of spent time percentage varied from 5.5 in phrase 2 to
13.5 in phrase 3.The percentages of mean spent time were: 24.5 ± 1.47, 17.1 ± 1.42, 27.3 ± 3.70
and 31.4 ± 3.14, respectively. No statistically significant relationship between participants’ academic
level and percentage of local time spent was observed (Table 2).

The lowest standard deviation was observed in the local time spent in phrases 1 and 2. These first
two phrases (m. 1–7) are built on an antecedent-consequent phrase structure. On the other hand, the
broadest standard deviation calculated for the local time regarding the third phrase indicates that this
phrase seems to have been interpreted differently among the students. A close analysis of such data
allows us to distribute this population into two groups: Approximately half of the students played at
a slower tempo (Group 1), and the other half played faster (Group 2). For clarity, data extracted from
the commercial recording (pianist) were compared to the pattern (nominal performance), included
as an inset, as shown in Figure 3.
As shown in Figure 3, most of the students (13) and the professional pianist played the fourth
phrase at a slower tempo. The expected nominal local time described by the pattern confirms this
occurrence. Two students (U2c and M1b – Group I) played the fourth phrase at a faster tempo.
The graph shows that Group II, similar to the pianist, spent more time on the performance of the
last phrase, followed by the third, which was played even slower than the second phrase. It is also
worth noting that the professional pianist differed from both Groups I and II in the relative time allo-
cated to phrase 2; in contrast even to the nominal performance, the pianist spent a longer time on this
particular phrase, emphasizing the arrival to the climax at the beginning of the third phrase (m.8).
As shown in Figure 3, there is a sharp split in the students’ behavior: Group II accelerated toward
the last phrase (m.12), whereas Group I slowed down, affecting the manipulation of timing. In
addition, Group II compensated for the faster pace by slowing down the last segment of the third
phrase. For clarity, Figure 4 illustrates the excerpt of the third phrase by signalizing the four segments
(S) and the corresponding notes (N) of the melodic line.
As shown in Figure 4, each segment of the third phrase (m. 8–12) is tied to the next by held tones
in the two top voices with a subtle increase in the number of voices along with a broader registral
disposition. As a result, the imitative counterpoint between soprano and alto disposed in a descend-
ing sequence from the first to the second semi-phrase along dynamic changes has implications for
Figure 4. Guarnieri’s Ponteio No. 22, ms 8–12. S stands for segment. N stands for note.

the realization of the passage as a whole. In the present research, the resulting performance of this
third phrase will be used as a sample for the evaluation of the results in the manipulation of timing.
The choice of acceleration at this particular point seems to contradict the sadness (triste) character
indicated by the composer. It is worth noting that the contour in these segments presents these six
notes (N) organized into two sets of three notes, starting in upbeat and reaching the third note in
downbeat. The measure-by-measure indication of crescendo and decrescendo (m. 8–12) seems to
support this interpretative hypothesis.
A cursory reading of the score seems to indicate the crucial role played by events that occur in the
third phrase. Therefore, the quality of each student’s performance of this phrase seems to reveal a
level of proficiency. Considering the character of the piece (sad) and the structural characteristics
of the third phrase, performers who accelerated (Group II, see Figure 3) did not seem to be aware
of the character or did not yet have the skills to communicate it.
According to students’ statements at the interviews after the performance recording session, some
students in Group I expressed their deliberated choice and planned strategies to convey the requested
character of the piece:
[After playing,] I have started thinking about the character, the resources that will be employed [to convey it]:
darker sound and soft dynamics because it is very intimate. I should not articulate the notes too much, [but
could] explore the rubato through the timing especially here [m. 8]. (D2c)
Tried to subdue the melody by employing a tempo slower than that indicated on the score, avoiding accelera-
tion. Avoid playing too explicit a cantabile. (M1b)
I want to clearly hear E at the bass to listen to the melody more freely, like Alma Brasileira [reference to Villa-
Lobos’s piano piece Brazilian Soul]. (… ) Somehow harmful, not so beaty. In the counterpoint part [m. 8–12],
one needs to emphasize the dialogue and the echoes. It is something very in-time. I have to retain the tempo
(… ). (U2b)
According to the statements cited above, students in Group I seem to be focused on the time
manipulation to convey the character (sad) that is explicit on the score. On the other hand, some
of the students in Group II mentioned:
This music sounds like Bossa Nova: ostinato, which is overlaid by a winding, sinuous line, which was probably
the popular song at that time. The character is that of a seresta [serenade]. [It is] somewhat free but still well
grounded on the written page. We have to know what kind of freedom we have and howmuch we can make use
of. It feels like a written rubato. (… ) But, to convey a sad character, I have a set of choices, and I have so many
ways: the conduction of the melody, the conduction of the tritons [he/she plays the intermediate line]… so it is
not something clear to me now (… ). (M1a)
The split [of the melody] between the hands is still difficult for me (… ) Its sonority is hard to achieve (… ) In
the first system, I even thought of something expressive, but after the third system [m. 8], I did not decide yet.
(U1a)
I played it now, but I did not plan how to perform it. The composer asked for sad, but I felt just a melancholic
atmosphere due to the harmony (… ), not the sadness. (M1c)
Based on the excerpts above, it is evident that some of the students had technical difficulties and
others did not have clear idea for the interpretative decisions or even plan the intended performance.
The analysis of the two semi-phrases of the third phrase shows that the participants spent roughly
the same percentage of time on each: 49.24% (SD 2.10) and 50.75% (SD 2.11), respectively. These
results suggest that the differences observed in Figure 2 may be linked to the nature of each segment
The analysis was further conducted by considering the interonset interval (IOI) (Friberg and
Battel 2002) between the notes (N) of the phrase contour, labeled here as N1 to N6 (see Figure
4). Figure 5 shows the deviation of the mean IOI from the nominal mean IOI, expressed as percen-
tage deviation from a horizontal baseline, within each segment for the investigated students. For
comparative reasons, data from the professional pianist were also included. Repp (1993) notes
that such an approach works solely when no extreme ritardandi are present, which is the case here.

As shown in Figure 5, the pianist presented a narrowly distributed IOI percentage among the seg-
ments. There is acceleration during segments 1 and 3 (crescendi signals) and compensatory decelera-
tion during segments 2 and 4 (decrescendi signals). Two students (D2c and U2c) displayed a similar
pattern. Nine of the 15 students also showed a narrow distribution of IOI values but not necessarily
the same pattern chosen by the pianist. Most of the students decelerated at the fourth segment. A
similar phenomenon was reported by Penel and Drake (1998), who observed that the last measure
in a phrase was, on average, played slower than the preceding one, which showed that there was glo-
bal phrase-final lengthening. This phenomenon was assigned to the perceptual limitation of the
auditory system, in which the last interval of a basic group is perceived as shorter and is therefore
performed longer to sound consistent.
A further analysis was conducted in terms of the mean IOI for each segment. Within the inves-
tigated segment, the longest IOI values were found for notes N6N5 in S2 (0.58 s) and S4 (0.63 s).
These results may be a consequence of the articulation of the semi-phrase ending. Comparing the
IOI within the four segments, the students seem to compensate for the note value in N3N2 and
N5N4 (longer mean IOI) as an adjustment to the polyrhythmic structures. The application of Pear-
son’s correlation analysis to the IOI within each segment is illustrated in Figure 6.
As shown in Figure 6, the detected correlations differ according to each group and each segment.
Despite the resemblance between S1 and S3, the latter is slightly simpler. In S1 (Figure 6(a)), Group II
shows a strong negative correlation between the IOIs N3N2 and N4N3 (Pearson’s correlation −0.845
at the 0.01 level), suggesting that the time spent fitting the polyrhythm 4:3 (N3N2) is compensated in
the following IOI (N4N3). Conversely, Group I shows a negative correlation but between IOIs N4N3
and N5N4, suggesting that the fitting is performed the polyrhythmic figuration 3:2. In S3 (Figure 6
(b)), Group II presents several positive correlations that trend toward accelerating at this third phrase
(see Figure 3). At this segment, Group I seems to speed up and compensates by slowing down the end
of this segment (IOIs N3N2 and N6N5, respectively). The pattern of attack adjusted for the melodic
line seems to depend more on the fitting of the 4:3 polyrhythm than on the 3:2 one. No correlations
were observed in the case of S2 and S4.
So far, we have based our findings on the structural features of the temporal organization mainly
at micro-levels. However, the manipulation of timing also depends on the manipulation of the
dynamics, pedal, articulation, contour phrase and texture. Mathematical analysis can be a tool to

provide a comprehensive understanding of the resulting product. Thus, the third phrase was further
analyzed by considering each of the four segments according to the mathematical function described
in the Method section. This modeling generated the set of curves represented in Figure 7. Students’
choice of tempi was taken at face value at all times. We opted not to normalize to avoid affecting the
nature of the data.
Each segment was compared against both the pianist’s performance and the nominal perform-
ance. Figure 8 illustrates the analysis of the four segments grouped as U2c, U3a, M1b and M1c
expressed as the deviation compared with the nominal performance (straight line at zero). In S1
and, less, in S3, one can observe a similar profile among the four cases, thus corroborating Pearson’s
correlation (see Figure 6). Taking into account that the nominal performance is void of rhythmic and
intensity (dynamics) microvariations, the deviations observed in Figure 8 suggest that timing seems
to be a relevant factor that may affect the student’s performance. Similarly, the absence of correlation
is confirmed in the individualized profiles for S2 and S4. It is worth noting that timing manipulation
can be used to emphasize a specific note (or group of notes) by lengthening the tone, by delaying the
onset, by inserting a micropause before the accented note, by playing the accented note more legato,
and by changing the articulation (one legato note surrounded by staccato notes), just to mention a
few (Friberg and Battel 2002). Thus, such individual variations are seen in the deviations from the
nominal performance represented in Figure 8.
The analysis of the MSE seems not to be directly related to the academic level. The data from
Table 1 can be classified into four levels:
(i) Good final product (11–12.5): U2c and D2c;
(ii) Acceptable final product (12.5–13.9): U3a, M1c, D1a;
(iii) Fair final product (13.9–15.8): U2b, M1b, D2a, U1a, U1b, D2b;

(iv) Poor final product (15.8–18.5): D2d, U2a, U3b, M1a.
According to the classification above, the level of performance may be interpreted in terms of pro-
ficiency level rather than academic level. One indication of this argument can be found on the

analysis of the shown segment, whose classification of performance level demonstrates the distri-
bution of doctoral students into the four classification categories. Figure 9 illustrates the time man-
agement of the four doctoral students. For comparison, the IOI of the notes between the two hands of
the pianist and of the patterns is included.
According to Figure 9, the professional pianist has good control over the note distribution within
the polyrhythm structures between both hands. Among the doctoral students, one observes that D2c,
although holistically well managed, shows irregular space within the attack of the melodic conduction
(N, right hand). D2b and D2d, considered to have poor and fair final products, respectively, seem to
group triolets in the third phrase in groups closer to the two notes organization rather than in three.
A similar approach was taken by students U2a and U3b, who presented very high MSE values (see
Table 1) and whose performances were classified as a poor final product. In other words, the students
with poor final products demonstrated errors in the organization of the beats.
It is worth noting that the two students whose final products were considered good (based on
MSE results) demonstrated a pattern of phrase organization and tempo management similar to
that of the professional pianist (see Figure 5). Among the students classified as having poor final pro-
ducts, M1a and U2a played with the fastest tempo, and D2d played with the slowest tempo (see
Figure 2). Such a tempo choice seems to have compromised the fidelity to the requested tempo
(and character) requested by the composer. In summary, the tempo choice and the beat organization
in the polyrhythm structure seem to be the main causes of the largest MSE. Of course, timing devi-
ations might not solely arise from the music structure but might also be related to the idiosyncrasy of
a performer’s style or even associated with a phenomenon of perceptual compensation (such as when
intervals can be heard shorter and thus played longer; Repp 1992; Penel and Drake 1998; Serrà,
Özaslan, and Arcos 2013).
Final remarks
In the present studied population, the manipulation of timing was shown to be independent of the
academic level and was more closely related to the proficiency level, as shown in the present popu-
lation, whose performance was prepared without the assistance of their piano teachers. From an
instrument pedagogy point of view, this research provides insights into the importance of awareness
of the implications of timing adjustments at micro, meso and macro levels. The meso-level

interpretation has shown that the interpretative choice in the direction and phrase conducting could
be divided into two groups. This behavior is more related to agogic rather than timing. Here, per-
haps, there is an opportunity to foment in students a critical consciousness about rhythmic struc-
tures and their implications for coherence within the limits set by the stylistic conventions of
western classical music.
In the present study, mathematical modeling of the students’ performances provided accuracy
and reliability to analyze and compare the performances of this Brazilian piece. This approach
allowed this analysis to be conducted without interference from independent judges, who, although
very relevant, may be affected by subjective attitudes. Furthermore, although the study examined
only an excerpt, the chosen approach facilitated the observation of the phenomenon in a holistic
manner without decomposing or weighing potential parameters that may be extractable from the
performances. In the present study, despite the focus on timing, the mathematical modeling pro-
vided more global and integrated information on the acoustic phenomenon.
One potential means of employing this mathematics-based evaluation approach may be a self-
monitoring algorithm for daily practice, which could serve as a guide to demonstrate points of
bias from a given performance (nominal or artistic from a commercial record) whether these devi-
ations were deliberate or accidental. The application of computer feedback for various aspects of
music performance has been reviewed in the literature (Webster 2002). Johnson, Madsen, and Ger-
inger (2012) investigated the use of software that allows students to control the rhythmic timing of a
given performance without changing any other musical parameters. This approach has been pro-
posed as a tool for teaching rhythmic nuances (rubato, for instance). Specifically, in the case of moni-
toring the expression of emotions, Juslin et al. (2006) developed a feedback-learning musical
expressivity program, which was shown to improve communication accuracy among semi-pro-
fessional jazz/rock guitar players. However, 75% of the volunteers responded negatively to using
the program in the future. Despite the result in that specific context, we believe that the availability
of such a self-evaluation tool can be a relevant supplementary technological tool for improving music
interpretation.
As one of the main results of the present research, we claim that a mathematical model one of this
kind can be seen as tool and as such, more objective than human judgment usually is. Our findings
imply a new question: How can instrumental teachers approach rhythmic pacing and rhythmic
interpretation? Our suggestion is to have students practice in a way that fosters reflexive thinking
as far as the intentional delimitation of basic rhythm structures and the broadening the ways of
learning, ordering and disciplining the rhythmic flow (Meyer 1956). Students tend to learn the
notes along with figures (rhythmic figurations) but not the overall rhythmic structure. We contend
that Cooper and Meyer’s model (1963) based on groupings allied to the steady pulse generates an
objective (and subjective) organization and time span into regular recurrences. This awareness of
regular recurrent time spans may help students on the determination of rhythm groupings based
on the search of the logic of the musical events, which in turn helps them to emphasize and deem-
phasize events. We also contend that the grouping of events around melodic and harmonic struc-
tures might result into higher rhythmic organization such as the flow of phrases and periods.
According to Meyer (1956) and Lerdahl and Jackendoff (1983), the grouping of melodic and harmo-
nic structures within phrases and periods brings out important rhythmic events thus allowing the
establishment of larger rhythmic units thus providing a coherent flow. From the performance
point of view, management of tempo [flow] has been shown to be a rather neglected parameter. (San-
tos and Gerling 2011). Students usually pay less attention to the global affects of rhythmic structures
and the hierarchy of musical events.
Another implication from the present approach as far as music education is concerned is the fact
that instrumental teachers might be made aware of the need of explaining in detail the adjustments
in micro-, meso- e macro-temporal rhythmic organizations along with expressive and interpretative
decisions This approach might contribute to highlighting local features and this procedure might
also impact the overall shaping of the piece, that is, its agogic. Finally, the present mathematical

modeling calls particular attention to a more objective approach as far as tempo and rhythmic
grouping are managed and organized. It is necessary to allocate time to foster the student’s percep-
tion and understanding of how groupings emerge from the style of the work.
