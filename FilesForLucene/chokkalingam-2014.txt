Abstract: Advances in the acquisition of complex medical images and storing it for further analysis through image 
mining have significantly helped to identify the root causes for various diseases. Mining of medical image data set 
such as scanned images or blood cell images require extraction of implicit knowledge from the data set through 
hierarchical image processing techniques and identifying the relationships and patterns that are not explicitly stored 
in a single image. Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease and it cause chronic inflammation of the 
joints. Causes of the RA is unknown due to that need to find out in the early stage is required. Diagnosis of RA 
based on blood cell types and shapes requires computational analysis. An assistive technology for the doctor to 
detect and investigate rheumatoid arthritis is therefore required. The objective of the proposed work is to analyze the 
shapes of lymphocytes, a key component of blood cells that causes RA complications, to automate the process of 
identifying abnormal lymphocytes by estimating the centroids of lymphocytes using AIT centroid technique and 
thereby finding a differential count. The process involves cropping nucleus from the blood cell image, segmenting it 
and to investigate further whether the shapes of the lymphocytes are irregular and dissimilar. Features are extracted 
from each cell components for comparison and the abnormal lymphocytes are segregated from the normal. To 
enhance the segregation process, neural network based perceptron classifier tool is used.

INTRODUCTION 
 
Image mining is an incredible technology to 
produce all the patterns without specifying any 
information of the image content. Establishment of an 
image mining system has been frequently tortuous 
processed because it implies joining diverse techniques 
ranging from image retrieval and indexing schemes up 
to data mining and pattern recognition. The 
fundamental challenging in image mining is to 
determine how low-level pixel representation contained 
in a raw image or image sequence can be efficiently and 
effectively processed to identify the relationships. 
Rheumatoid Arthritis is a chronic disease, which 
attacks the synovial tissue that lubricates the joints of 
the human skeleton. It is the disease that affects the 
musculoskeletal system including bones, muscles, 
joints and tendons that Contribute to loss of function 
and range of movement and difficulties in performing 
activities of daily living. Rheumatoid arthritis typically 
occurs in joints on both sides of the body (such as 
hands, knees, or wrists). 
The process of life is maintained by blood, which 
is a specialized body fluid consisting of plasma and 
blood cells. To perform a proper diagnosis of the 
disease, identification of the blood cells and their 
relative quantity in the blood samples must be known. 
A blood film or peripheral blood smear is a thin layer of 
blood smeared on a microscope slide and then stained 
in such a way to allow the various blood cells to be 
examined microscopically. Due to the development in 
technology, this traditional blood examination is 
digitized. By connecting a high resolution digital 
camera to the microscope, the blood cell images are 
captured by adjusting the microscope magnification to 
obtain a fairly good resolution image. For identifying 
different types of blood cells and for counting their 
quantity in blood smear, image processing is applied. 
This study attempts to analyze the shapes of 
lymphocytes in the blood cell images resulting in a 
better investigation of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) 
through an automated process. Differential count and 
shapes of lymphocytes in white blood cells provide 
valuable information that aids in diagnosis of RA.

MATERIALS AND METHODS 
 
Analysis of White Blood Cells (WBCs) requires a 
segmentation algorithm, which separates the Region of 
Interest (ROI) from the blood cell image. The accuracy 
of the segmentation algorithm has a great impact on the 
final results of the analysis. Various approaches are 
available for segmenting ROI from the image. Fast 
segmentation approach for automatic differential 
counting of White Blood cells (Anoraganinrum, 1999). 
This involves simple localization of WBCs using some 
prior information about the blood smear images and 
with recursively applying thresholding; the various 
components of WBCs are separated. Then 
morphological operations such as erosion and dilation 
are applied to smoothen the segmented image. In order 
to classify the WBCs, only the information about the 
nucleus is adequate (Sharma and Sahni, 2011). By 
applying the localization of white blood cell method 
(Mamatha et al., 2012), the problem of cells that touch 
each other can be eliminated. The segmentation of 
nucleus alone from the smear image is easier than 
segmenting the entire cell (Arifin and Asano, 2006). 
This can be achieved by using mathematical 
morphology of WBCs. Differential counting can be 
automated using an automated approach, which extract 
features from the segmented image with the help of 
‘Eigen faces’ a widely used method in face recognition 
(Yampri et al., 2006) A combination of Principal 
Component Analysis (PCA) and parametric feature 
detection can be used for this purpose (Brunelli and 
Mich 2000). The above system uses a set of known 
features that are projected into a feature space that 
holds significant variations known as Eigen cells. 
A segmentation method, which uses the benefit of 
active contour, can be utilized for segmenting WBCs 
(Yampri et al., 2006). The active contour method 
involves converting a color image into a binary image 
using a threshold and placing the initial circular shape 
(snake) inside the roughly identified position of WBCs. 
By using gradient flow vector force the initial circular 
shape is allowed to grow until it fits the exact shape of 
the nucleus. Then the individual WBC is separated 
from the smear image using the extracted contour 
Subrajeet et al. (2010). 
Poisson equation based approach can be used to 
extract the number of segments of the nucleus. The 
inner distances can be used to represent the shape 
features  of  the  nucleus  segments  (Theerapattanakul 
et al., 2004). In the above technique, two different 
shape features are used for training the neural network. 
The concept of the random walk is used as a solution to 
the Poisson equation and is combined with an inner 
distance to extract these features Singh and Singh 
(2012). 
A two stage color segmentation strategy along with 
fuzzy clustering is used for separating WBCs from 
other blood components (Bharanidharan and Ghosh, 
2012). After extracting the Leukocytes, Lymphocytes 
are identified from the segmented image as a subclass. 
Various features such as fractal features, shape features 
and other texture features are extracted from the sub 
class of Lymphocytes Sumathi and Ravindran (2011). 
In addition to all the above features, two new features 
Hausdr off Dimension and contour signature are 
employed for further classification Padmavathi et al. 
(2010). 
To measure the degree of cell clumping in terms of 
area and the number of cells it contains, the approach 
proposed in Sharma and Sahni (2011) has been 
recalled. In order to classify a large set of blood smear 
images into good, sparse and clumped, an integrated 
approach using Shannon entropy is used Kavallieratou 
and Stamatatos (2006). To detect good working areas in 
an image both the feature of spatial distribution and cell 
clumping algorithms are employed Nosrati et al. 
(2012). Image classification is enhanced using optimal 
feature selection. Pre-processing, Segmentation, 
Feature extraction, Classification and Prediction are the 
steps concentrates for identifying the shapes of 
Lymphocytes Al-amri et al. (2010). 
 
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
 
De-noising of images: The initial phase of the image 
processing is the preprocessing of the image. It is done 
to enhance the quality of image obtained from various 
sources such that it satisfies the requirement of further 
processing. Image De-noising is one of the 
preprocessing mechanisms it is used to remove noise 
from acquired image. Noise is the common term to 
describe visual distortion. The noise will affect the 
quality of the image and, the main factor is that noise 
can coat and reduce the visibility of certain features 
within the image. Stray marks, marginal noise and salt-
and-pepper noise are independent of size; location of 
the underlying content. Similarly the texture of the 
observed speckle pattern is independent of the 
underlying content (Agrawal and Doermann, 2009) 
Regular noise is always showing a consistent behavior 
in terms of these properties. On the other hand, noise 
such as salt-and-pepper noise that does not show a 
consistent behavior is classified under “irregular noise 
(Mamatha et al., 2012). In this study we have made an 
attempt to study the four common types of noises like 
Gaussian, salt and pepper, Poisson and speckle noise. 
Gaussian noise also called Random Variation Impulsive 
Noise (RVIN) or normal noise T is a type of statistical 
noise in which the amplitude of the noise follows that 
of a Gaussian distribution (Mamatha et al., 2012). Salt-
and-pepper noise is also called as Fat-tail distributed or 
impulsive noise or spike noise. An image containing 
salt-and-pepper noise will have dark pixels in bright 
regions and bright pixels in dark regions. Statistical

Quantum Fluctuations induce a prominent noise type in 
the lighter parts of an image from an image sensor. This 
noise is called photon shot noise or Poisson noise. The 
noises at different pixels are independent of each other. 
Speckle noise is a granular noise that increases the 
mean grey level of a local area in an image. This type 
of noise makes it difficult for image recognition and 
interpretation.  
In image processing, filters are mainly used to 
suppress either the high frequencies in the image, i.e., 
smoothing the image, or the low frequencies, i.e., 
enhancing or detecting edges in the image. Noise 
removal is easier in the spatial domain as compared to 
the frequency domain as the spatial domain noise 
removal requires very less processing time (Nichol and 
Vohra, 2004). Average filtering replaces each pixel 
value in an image with the mean value of its neighbors, 
including itself. The simplest procedure would be to 
calculate the mask for all the pixels in the image. For all 
the pixels in the image which fall under this mask, it 
will be considered as the new pixel (Patidar et al., 
2010). This has the effect of eliminating pixel values 
which are unrepresentative of their surroundings. 
Average filter is also considered to be a convolution 
filter or a mean filter. 
The median filter is an effective method that can 
suppress isolated noise without blurring sharp edges. In 
Median Filtering, all the pixel values are first sorted 
into numerical order and then replaced with the middle 
pixel value (Murali et al., 2012) The Gaussian filter is a 
non-uniform low pass filter. The kernel coefficients 
diminish with increasing distance from the kernel’s 
centre. Central pixels have a higher weighting than 
those on the periphery.  
The inverse filtering is a restoration technique for 
de-convolution, i.e., when the image is blurred by a 
known low pass filter, it is possible to recover the 
image by inverse filtering or generalized inverse 
filtering. However, inverse filtering is very sensitive to 
additive noise.

preprocessing of the image. It is done to enhance the 
quality of image obtained from various sources such 
that it satisfies the requirement of further processing.

Preprocessing image setup and results: A set of 108 
images had been taken for analysis. Each image is 
subjected to different types of noise mentioned above. 
Each image with added noise is subjected to different 
types of filters. The filtered image is compared against 
the original image using the following image quality 
measures. 
 
Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR): The Peak Signal 
to Noise Ratio is calculated by: 
 
𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 = 20𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙𝑙10 �
𝑃𝑃
𝑀𝑀𝑃𝑃𝑀𝑀
� 𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑                                 (1) 
 
For the image quality measures, if the value of the 
PSNR is very high for an image with a particular noise 
type then it is the best quality image. Table 1 shows the 
aggregated PSNR value of each image subjected to 
different type of filters. According to PSNR, it is clear 
that the median filter gives best result over salt and 
pepper noise and Wiener is more suitable for Gaussian 
noise, Poisson noise and Speckle noise.

where, M and N are the total number of pixels in the 
horizontal and the vertical dimensions of image, g 
denotes The Noise image and f denotes the filtered 
image. The lowest mean square error represents the best 
quality image. 
Table 2 shows that the MSE value of an image 
subjected to median filter has the lowest value of salt 
and pepper noise it shows that median filter is the best 
choice for Salt and pepper noise. Image subjected to 
Weiner filter gives the lowest MSE value and Wiener is 
more suitable for Gaussian noise, Poisson noise and 
Speckle noise. 
 
Normalized correlation (NK): The closeness between 
two digital images can also be quantified in terms of the 
correlation function. These measures measure the 
similarity between two images, hence in this sense they 
are complementary to the difference based measures. 
All the correlation based measures tend to 1, as the 
difference between two images tend to zero. It is 
calculated using the formula: 
 
𝑃𝑃𝑁𝑁 =
∑ ∑ �𝑓𝑓(𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 ).𝑓𝑓 ′(𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 )�𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗=1
𝑀𝑀
𝑖𝑖=1
∑ ∑ (𝑓𝑓(𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 ))2𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗=1
𝑀𝑀
𝑖𝑖=1
                             (3) 
 
For image-processing applications in which the 
brightness of the image and the template can vary due 
to lighting and exposure conditions, the images can be 
first normalized. 
This is typically done at every step by subtracting 
the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. If the 
normalized cross correlation tends to 1, then the image 
quality is deemed to be better.  
Table 3 shows that the NK value of an image 
subjected to Median filter over all types on noise is near 
to 1, which is followed by Gaussian filter and Weiner 
filter and finally the Mean filter shows the poor 
correlation value over all other types of filters. 
 
Normalized Absolute Error (NAE): Normalized 
Absolute Error should be the minimum in order to 
minimize the difference between original and obtained 
image. It is calculated using the formula: 
 
𝑃𝑃𝑁𝑁𝑀𝑀 =
∑ ∑ ��𝑓𝑓(𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 ).𝑓𝑓 ′(𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 )��𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗=1
𝑀𝑀
𝑖𝑖=1
∑ ∑ |𝑓𝑓(𝑖𝑖,𝑗𝑗 )|𝑃𝑃𝑗𝑗=1
𝑀𝑀
𝑖𝑖=1
                                (4) 
 
The normalized absolute error indicates how 
different both the de-noised image and the original 
image are with the value of zero being the perfect fit. A 
large value of NAE represents the poor quality of the 
image.  
Table 4 shows that NAE value of an image 
subjected to Median filter over salt and pepper noise 
have the lowest value; for all other types of noise. 
Image subjected to Weiner filter gives the lowest NAE 
value. The mean filter shows an average performance 
over all type noise then followed by Gaussian filter.

Compares the performance of four spatial domain 
filters mean filter, Median Filter, Gaussian filter and 
Weiner Filter to de-noise the images subjected to four 
different types of noise Salt-and-Pepper, Gaussian, 
Poisson and Speckle noise which can be accumulated 
during image acquisition phase of Microscopic image 
processing. From the results shown above, it is clear 
that the median filter shows its best performance over 
salt-and-pepper noise and Weiner filter shows good 
performance over Gaussian, Poisson and Speckle noise. 
It also shows an optimum performance over salt-and-
pepper noise and hence it is concluded that Weiner 
filter is an optimum filter that can be applied to 
microscopic images (Fig. 1). 
 
Image segmentation: Image segmentation is used to 
identify the regions of interest in an image or to 
annotate the data. White blood cell image contains 
neutrophil, basophil, eosinophil, lymphocyte, monocyte 
and platelets. Figure 2 contains lymphocytes with other 
types. Using threshold mechanism RPG of white blood 
cell image is converted into a binary image. If the 
image is clumsy then the sub imaging is performed 
using adaptive contour method (Zang and Chen, 2001). 
After microscopic images are obtained, it needs to be 
preprocessed for more accuracy.  
 
ROI retrieval: As Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) needs to 
consider only the lymphocytes as the Regions of 
Interest (ROI) and the essential features are extracted 
from this ROI. Segmentation isolates lymphocytes from 
white blood cells shown in Fig. 2. 
 
Preparation of image set: Samples of stained blood 
slides are collected from various laboratories. The 
images are captured with a digital microscope under 
100x oil immersed setting and with an effective 
magnification of 1000. Due to excessive staining, noise 
may accumulate in images. Weiner filter is an optimum 
filter shows better performance for microscopic images 
so Weiner filter is used in preprocessing module and 
adaptive threshold into noise detection process led more 
reliable and more efficient detection of noise. Figure 3 
shows the output image obtained from preprocessing. 
 
Image segmentation using threshold: In our proposed 
thresholding method values are assigned to the slider 
controls and images are segmented based on the slider 
values (Fig. 4). 
The RGB images are converted into gray scale 
image. Sizes of images are in the matrix forms and it 
can be assigned into row and column. It is required to 
process up to the n number of rows and columns and 
each time it will check whether row and column values 
are greater than slider values and if yes, it can be 
converted into a white pixel otherwise it can be taken as 
black.

Centroid estimation: After detecting the edges using 
canny edge method, bounding box is drawn around the 
irregular lymphocyte to crop out the nucleus. Then the 
size of the cropped nucleus image is computed and the 
nucleus values are assigned to respective rows and a 
column. Mean-x and Mean-y can be calculated based 
on the area of the image (Fig. 5). 
 
Area calculation: The entire image is scanned from

Classification using neural network: The perceptron 
learning rule is a method for finding the weights in a 
network. Single Layer perceptron is used as classifier. 
This method is used to solve the problem of supervised 
learning for classification (Fig. 7): 
 
• Initialize the weights (either to zero or to a small 
random value) 
• Pick a learning rate μ (this is a number between 0 
and 1) 
• Until stopping condition is satisfied (e.g., weights 
don't change) 
 
For each training pattern (x, t): 
 
• Compute output activation  
y = f (w x) 
• If y = t, don't change weights

The area and perimeter of normal lymphocytes of 
different images are given Table 5. The radial lines are 
drawn from the center of the Lymphocyte to its edge-
contour to derive its perimeter. The area of the 
Lymphocyte has been divided into ten equal intervals. 
The radial distance from the center to its edge varies 
from one segment to the other segment ranging from 33 
to 53. The pixel count in each region is counted and 
plotted into the respective column of the table shown. It 
is assumed to have all the pixels be located between 33 
and 53 to conform normalcy else we can expect there is 
an abnormality in the Lymphocytes. The details in 
Table 6 illustrate the abnormality of Lymphocytes 
based on the prediction technique adopted in Table 5 
and 6. Prediction technique is a method which is used 
to analyze the future things after presenting the training 
instances to the learner. Line which is started from the 
Centre into edges pixels counts are calculated and 
presented into the appropriate places. In every time a 
new image is processed and matches with our dataset 
and identified whether it is infected or not (Fig. 8).  
 
SUMMARY AND CONCLUDING REMARKS 
 
Medical image mining is an interdisciplinary 
domain, which focuses on similarity and retrieval of 
patters in domain specific applications to solve 
challenging problem in the medical field. An automatic 
identification process is proposed in this study that 
detects the shape of Lymphocytes through image 
segmentation and centroid analysis. The algorithm uses 
threshold and classification for approximation. Weiner 
filter shows good performance over Gaussian, Poisson 
and Speckle noise. It also shows an optimum 
performance over salt-and-pepper noise and hence it is 
concluded that Weiner filter is an optimum filter that 
can be applied to microscopic images. The dataset is 
trained through a perceptron neural network classifier 
for accurate analysis. Through these classification and 
segregation process it is found that it is possible to 
automate the process of diagnosing RA based on the 
blood cell images.
