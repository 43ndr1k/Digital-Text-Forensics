ABSTRACT–– Linguistics and stylistics have been studied for author identification / verification for few years 
but recently, we have testified a remarkable development in the quantity with which lawyers, courts, applicable 
in cyber crime, detective agencies etc. etc. have called upon the expertise of linguists in cases of disputed 
authorship. This inspires researchers to look to the problem of author identification / verification from a 
different outlook. This paper  pact shows text author verification problem using character n-gram information( 
final n-gram & initial n-gram) for both English & Arabic Text.  Experiments demonstrate that author profiles 
generated with initial bi-gram and initial tri-gram are effective in verifying texts authors. A doorsill value has 
been set using dissimilarity measure that separate dissimilarity of same author texts from texts written by 
different authors. 
KEYWORDS–– Author Verification, Character N-gram, Dis-similarity measure 
 
I. INTRODUCTION 
In the typical authorship attribution problem, a text of unknown authorship is assigned to one author, 
given a set of authors for whom text samples of undisputed authorship are available. The authorship attribution 
is a process of an anonymous text authorship recognition based on text samples written by a group of already 
known authors. It relies on a set of features deduced from text documents, and attempts to establish whether 
texts of an unknown authorship are significantly similar to any of the known text samples. This task is called 
authorship identification or author verification techniques. There are various types of stylometric features using 
computational methods such as word n-grams, vocabulary richness, character n-gram (fixed and variable 
length), content or language specific features. The N-gram method has been found useful in a wide variety of 
natural language-processing applications, including spelling error detection and correction [1],[2],[3], text 
compression [4], language identification [5],[6],[7],  text categorization [8],[9],[10], text searching and retrieval 
[8], text retrieval from document images [11], and other information retrieval related applications [12],[13]. 
Character n-gram is noise tolerant feature. Texts seems to be noisy, containing grammatical faults or short use 
of punctuation, usually occurs in e-mail or in online forum messages. Vividly, character n-gram representation 
does not affect [14]. An N-gram is a token consisting of a series of characters or words. N-gram approach is a 
encouraging alternative manuscript representation system for stylistic purposes. It has been shown that sub-
word units as character n-gram can be very effective for capturing the distinctions of an author’s style. 
Stamatatos [14] explores computational necessities and setting that can be applied authorship 
applications. Keselj et al [15] presented a programmed authorship attribution on character n-gram profiles on 
byte level n-grams. This approach is tested on three different languages: English, Greek and Chinese. 
Stamatatos [16] proposed method for intrinsic plagiarism detection using character n-gram profiles. In our 
effort, we examine character n-gram based author’s profile. We focused on identification process based on 
initial, medial, final and total bi-grams and tri-grams which - for our knowledge - have not been used so far 
[17]. Amasyali and Diri [18] used character n-gram in text categorization to identify Author, Genre and Gender. 
The success in determining the author of the text, genre of the text and gender of the author was obtained as 
83%, 93% and 96%, respectively. 
Sanderson and Guenter [19] described the use of several sequence kernels based on character n-grams 
of variable length, and the best results for short English texts were achieved when examining sequences of up to 
4-grams. An evaluation experiment has been prosed by Ogawa[20] which speed up the process of document 
retrieval using n-gram indexing. Authors proposed minimum-cost selection method and the redundant n-gram 
method which reduces retrieval time by using n-grams .Furthermore which also minimizes the processing cost 
estimated by the document histogram. Kanaris[21] presented a content-based approach to spam detection based 
on a predefined n-gram length (n=3, 4, or 5). In past study [22], three types of variant has been specified in 
which each variant is adapted by machine learning algorithm to resolve author various issues like author’s 
demographics, verification of mysterious document and in needle-in-a-haystack problem in which many 
thousands of candidates for each of whom we might have a very limited writing sample. SVM and Bayesian

regression machine learning method in conjunction with character n-gram technique offers efficient and real 
resolutions to the ordinary authorship attribution problem. N-gram text representation technique is used in 
Chinese text categorization. It has been shown that combination of 1-, 2-grams is little better than that of 1-, 2-, 
3-grams for Chinese text classification [23]. In recent study [24], it has been shown that hybrid algorithm is 
good way to attribute the author with reliability and accuracy based on short text messages. The correctness of 
author identity detection, depending of writing style, is surrounded in the range from 71% to 100%. 
N-gram technique examines the performance of the bi-gram and trigram term conflation techniques in 
the context of Arabic free text retrieval. The N-gram approach does not appear to provide an efficient conflation 
approach due to the idiosyncrasy imposed by the Arabic infix structure that reduces the rate of correct N-gram 
harmonizing [25]. Experimentation with Arabic language retrieval is still in its immature stage. Researchers in 
Arabic Information Retrieval can benefit greatly from the work that has been done in English, which has led to 
the development of many new techniques [26]. 
In this paper we mainly focused on author verification (i.e. to define if a specific author did or did not 
write the text) in English & Arabic Language. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes 
our approach. The experimental results and discussion are included in section 3. Finally section 4 contains 
conclusion. 
 
II. METHODOLOGY AND THE ALGORITHM 
Our approach is based on character bi-gram and tri-gram. We look into character n-gram and subsets 
of n-grams; the initial, medial and final n-grams. Digits and punctuation marks are removed. The profile is 
defined as a set of length L of the most frequent n-grams with their normalized frequencies. 
An author (i) profile is generated from a training author text. The n-gram profile of the text document 
to be classified (document profile) is compared with the profile of the corresponding author (i). The comparison 
is performed based on the dissimilarity measure algorithm [15]. In this algorithm, we generate the bi- and tri-
grams from author’s training sample text (author (i) profile). A similar profile is generated for the test data. Let 
f1(n) be the frequency of the nth bi- or tri-grams in the Author’s Profile. Let f2(n) be the frequency of the nth bi- 
or tri-grams in the test data. The dissimilarity between the two profiles is calculated using the following 
formula: 
 
    (1) 
In order to normalize these differences, we divide them by the average frequency for a given n-gram. 
                           (2) 
 
    (3) 
 
Verification Process: For a new text (new document) the profile is generated and dissimilarity with the 
author (i) profile is calculated. If it is less than the author (i) dissimilarity threshold "thi" then the new text 
belongs to the author (i). If not, the new text belongs to another author (Fig-2).

 Fig. 1 describes the method to find threshold value of a particular author after processing training and 
testing text. In this scheme, we do compare the author training profile and test profile of same author to find dis-
similarity measure. Among all those values of dis-similarity, maximum value could be taken as the door-step 
(author dissimilarity threshold "thi")  of that particular author. 
 
 Again, Fig. 2 after all pre-processing steps, a test profile of different author is being compared with the 
training profile to find dis-similarity measure which is further compared with particular author’s threshold value 
to verify the authentication of test profile. 
III. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS & DISCUSSION 
3.1 First Corpus:  
We considered English data set including four authors: Eva Gale, Ruth Ann Nordin, Ross Beckmann, 
and Payton Lee (Table 1). Authors’ profiles are obtained using training texts. In bi-gram, we used profile size 
L= 50, 100 & 200 and for tri-gram we take profile size of 100, 200, 500 & 700.

 Table 2 & Table 3 give you an idea about verification of authors using final n-gram. Results of final n-
grams are satisfactory. Table 4 & Table 5 demostrate that initial n-grams has  more added accuracy in 
identifying the authors. The outcome of initial n-gram reaches to 100% accuracy with the profile size L = 200 in 
both bi- & tri-grams whereas it also present the same accuracy level with L = 500 in initial tri-gram. Along with 
this, higher profile size of n-grams also provides comparatively more accuracy than lower profile size. 
3.2 Second Corpus:   
We reflected Arabic data set including four authors: Abdul Naseef, Adbullah Tayeh, Ahlam 
Mestiganmy, Nadia Quest (Table 6). Authors’ profiles are achieved using Arabic training texts. For both bi- & 
tri-gram profile size (L), we used L = 200, 500 & 700.

 The main focus in Arabic novels is selection of profile size (L). We empirically revealed that higher 
profile size L = 200, 500 & 700 present good accuracy level than lower profile size L = 50 & 100. Furthermore, 
we decided to analysis Arabic novels with higher profile size.

Table 7& Table 9 present a good quality inspirational results about verification of authors using bi-gram 
technique. Results of bi-grams in arabic novels are acceptable. Table 8 & Table 10 demostrate that tri-grams is 
precise or exact in identifying the authors. The outcome of tri-gram reaches to 100% accuracy with all the 
profile size L = 200 , 500 & 700 in both final & initial tri-grams. 
 
IV. CONCLUSIONS 
In this paper we presented character n-gram based author verification approach. Final n-gram & initial 
n-gram has been investigated in two languages: English & Arabic. In both the languages, results give 
confidence for further analysis. Our comparison shows the initial n-gram has more power in verifying the 
author rather than Final n-gram.
