Abstract
This paper compares the frequencies of certain common words in works by different
authors to determine whether word proportions can be used as an effective method
of authorial attribution. Works by James Fenimore Cooper and William Shakespeare
are analyzed. Results indicate that while certain words show statistically significant
differences in proportion, other words do not exhibit such disparity.

1 Introduction
Modern linguistic studies focus on a number of different aspects of literary works, one of the
most important being word frequencies. As can be deciphered, “word frequency” refers to
the number of times a certain word appears in a literary work. Similarly, the term “word
proportion” denotes the frequency of a word divided by the total number of words in the
work. Some applications of such word frequency studies include authorial attribution. In
fact, in his paper, Hoover presents the idea that the proportion of times a certain word is
used in an essay, for example, varies between different authors [1].
This paper will aim to test this hypothesis by comparing the word proportion of sim-
ple articles and demonstrative adjectives between four randomly selected works of James
Fenimore Cooper and William Shakespeare each. We test the hypothesis that a significant
difference will exist between the proportions of these words in the works of the different
authors.
We continue to detail our methodology. Results will follow, and the paper will conclude
with a discussion on possible explanations of the results.
2 Methodology
In order to fairly choose the four works1 that would be analyzed, we used the list on the
Project Gutenberg database of works for each author [2]. Each distinct work was numbered
alphabetically, and Maple’s random integer command, rand(1..n), where n is the number
of works, was used four times to choose the works. If the command outputted the same
number twice, the second result was omitted and the command was run another time.
For each work, the full text was downloaded and the Gutenberg introductory section—
1Each author had well over forty listings, although not all were novels. Thus, the choice of four works
does not strictly violate the idea that a sample cannot be over-representative of the population.
2
the entire section up till the date of the work—was deleted manually. Then, the text file was
run through a Perl script that
1. converted the entire text to lower case,
2. removed all punctuation,
3. tabulated the frequency of each word used in the work, and
4. outputted the total word count.
From this information, the frequencies of a certain few words were calculated simply by using
the formula
Propi =
ni
N∑
i=1
ni
, (1)
where Propi is the proportion of word i, ni is the number of times the word appears in the
work, and N is the total number of distinct words in the work. The words chosen as markers
were the articles “a” (or “an”) and “the,” as well as the demonstrative adjectives “this” and
“that.”
3 Results
The word frequencies of the chosen markers in Cooper’s works are given in Table 1 while
those for Shakespeare’s are given in Table 2. The word proportions are given in Tables 3
and 4, respectively.
Figure 1 shows the proportions of the four chosen words, comparing Shakespeare against
Cooper. Both articles (“a” and “the”) seem to show great disparity between Cooper’s

and Shakespeare’s styles; on the other hand, the demonstrative adjectives are very similar in
proportion. Two-sample t-tests were performed to determine significance, using the formula,

where x̄1 and x̄2 are the average sample word proportions of a certain word for Cooper’s and
Shakespeare’s works, respectively. For each test, we use the null hypothesis that µ1 = µ2 and
test it against the alternative µ1 6= µ2, where µ1 and µ2 obviously represent the population
word frequencies of all of Cooper’s and Shakespeare’s works, respectively. Table 5 shows the
p-values, which will be analyzed in the discussion that follows.

4 Discussion
At a level of α = 0.05, there is a significant difference between the word proportions of the
articles “a” (or “an”), as well as “the,” in the works of Shakespeare and Cooper. However,
such a significant difference does not appear while comparing the word proportions of the
demonstrative adjectives—“this” and “that.”
In his paper, Hoover mentions that differences in the proportions of certain words may
be a means of authorial attribution. In short, an anonymous piece of literature can possibly
be characterized as either “Shakespearean” or “Cooperan” simply by performing some sort
of analysis on the frequencies of certain words. Experimental results do indicate that there
exists a very significant difference between the word proportions of simple articles in the
works of two different authors. These results, coupled with Hoover’s research, suggest the
possibility that certain words may be used as markers for authorial attribution [1]. In fact,
the difference in proportions of these articles is amazingly significant, falling well within
even the α = 0.001 level. However, this very same experiment shows different results when
studying the demonstrative adjectives. The lack of statistical significance between the word
proportions of these demonstrative adjectives in the two authors’ works—both p-values are
well over 0.05—indicates that the original hypothesis of this paper must be qualified: exper-
imental results indicate that while proportions for some words differ significantly between
two authors, this statement cannot be generalized to apply to all words.
In a related manner, experimental results suggest that authorial attribution cannot be
accomplished simply by studying frequencies of one word. Rather, techniques for authorial
attribution depend on analyzing a number of different words encompassing diverse parts
of speech. Hoover does delineate a method of performing such analysis in his paper [1],
implementing cluster analysis.
Perhaps another notable aspect of this experiment lies in the choice of authors. Cooper,
6
known for his novels and novella, is compared to Shakespeare—a dramatist.2 Discrepancies
in writing are inherent when comparing such diverse genres. In effect, the genre itself may
have accounted for such large differences in the proportions of the articles. A recent paper
by Stamatatos, et. al. indicates that word frequency analysis of the most common works in
the English language can effectively determine genre [3].
Further experimentation may include performing similar word frequency analyses of dif-
ferent works of Shakespeare, such as his sonnets. In addition, other authors from other time
periods— e.g., Arthur Miller (twentieth century) and Sir Walter Scott (medieval England)—
can also be analyzed. In addition, multivariate relationships may be explored by calculating
word proportions of many common words. A table of such words is given in [3].
5 Conclusion
We have carried out simple word frequency analysis by calculating proportions of common
English words as used in the works of two different authors—James Fenimore Cooper and
William Shakespeare. Although we showed that there are statistically significant differences
in the proportion of times the words “a” (or “an”) and “the” are used, words such as “this”
and “that” failed to exhibit such disparities in proportion. We have also briefly discussed
the viability of using word frequency as a means of authorial attribution as well as the role
genre plays in word usage.
