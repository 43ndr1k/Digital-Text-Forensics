Abstract. With the evolution of internet, author profiling has become a topic of 
great interest in the field of forensics, security, marketing, plagiarism detection 
etc. However the task of identifying the characteristics of the author just based 
on a text document has its own limitations and challenges. This paper reports on 
the design, techniques and learning models we adopted for the PAN-2014 
Author Profiling challenge. To identify the age and gender of an author from a 
document we employed ensemble learning approach by training a Random 
Forest classifier with the training data provided by PAN organizers for English 
language only. Our work indicate that readability metrics, function words and 
structural features play a vital role in identifying the age and gender of an 
author.      
1   Introduction 
With more than 2 billion users, internet has provided a solid platform for people to 
share, communicate and express their ideas globally. Though online social media 
have brought people together, they are vulnerable to crimes like identity thefts, false 
information, identity masking etc. A lot of people fake their original identity either to 
remain anonymous or to perform different cybercrimes. Zheng et al. in [1] has 
showed that anonymity is a significant characteristic in online communities. The 
process of identifying the traits of an author like age, gender, country, religion etc 
from a document has become one of the hot topics for researches in the fields of 
security, forensics, marketing, etc.  
 In this paper, we present the working of our system which performs the 
Author Profiling task by PAN-2014. This task aims at identifying the age and gender 
of an author from four different datasets which are twitter tweets, blog data, social 
media posts and hotel reviews. The training data for this analysis is also provided by 
the PAN organizers. We employed different Natural Language Processing techniques 
to extract features from a text document and using the Random Forest classifier we 
determine the age and gender of the author. This paper presents the working model of 
our system along with our architecture diagram, the machine learning algorithms and 
techniques we used to complete the task.

The rest of the paper is organized in the following order. Section 2 discusses the 
related work by other researches we went through. In Section 3 we discuss our system 
details and in section 4 we explain in detail our methodology and implementation 
details. Finally in section 5 we draw conclusions and present future plans for 
extending and improvising our author profiling task.    
2   Literature Survey 
 A considerable amount of research has already been done to identify the 
traits of an author from a document using different machine learning algorithms and 
statistical models. In [2] Peng et al. mention that each author has his/her own unique 
stylometry of writing and refer to this feature as author profile. Pennebraker and 
Stone in [3] used the LIWC dataset and showed a relationship between language used 
and the age of the author. The study performed by Vimala Balakrishnan and Paul H.P 
[4] prove that age and gender of a mobile phone users do influence their texting style. 
John D. Burger, John Henderson and co-writers presented a language independent 
classifier for gender prediction from the twitter micro-blogging site [5]. In [6] Dong 
Nyugen et al. presented a linear regression model to predict the age of an author from 
a given text document. Claudia Peersman performed an exploratory study for 
predicting age and gender form chat texts using Netlog corpus data [7]. R 
Chandramouli in [8] compared the working of SVM, AdaBoost and Logistic 
regression for gender identification. Shlomo Argamon shows the differences in the 
male and female writing using the British National Corpus in [9].  
In [10] the authors propose a tool TAT to profiling the authors of Arabic emails. 
Calix et al. [11] used 55 different features to analyze the stylometry of authors for 
email author identification and authentication. All previous years PAN Author 
Profiling research papers could be found from [15], [16] and [17]. 
    
3   System Architecture 
 In this notebook we propose our solution for author profiling from a given 
set of text documents. We have used a combination of Semantic, Syntactic and 
Natural Language Processing (NLP) analysis for finding the same. The output of each 
analysis is fed into a trained ensemble classifier which determines the age and gender 
of the author. Figure 1 shows the detailed architectural diagram of our work.

For performing the Author Profiling task we used the data corpus provided by 
PAN-2014. The corpus consisted of various xml documents which had to be handled 
in an offline (Hotel reviews and Social media) and online (Twitter and Blog) mode. 
The Twitter training data had to be downloaded due to Twitter terms of service. The 
cleaned blog corpus from RSS feeds was provided by PAN organizers, but it only 
contained partial data. To obtain full data we decided to crawl it online and then use it 
for analysis. The data crawled from both these modes is then cleaned for the removal 
of xml contents, urls, user mentions (twitter), etc. The cleaned data is then pushed into 
a database.  
After crawling and data cleaning we had the following data entries in the database 
for training. Table 1 and 2 shows the number of posts we extracted overall.

The data set is then retrieved from the database and sent for text analysis which 
involves Natural Language Processing, Readability Analysis, Syntactic analysis and 
Structural Analysis. We extract a total of 22 features from each data set and send it to 
Random Forest Classifier for training purposes. This trained ensemble classifier is 
then used later for training purposes. In the next module we will explain our 
implementation process in detail.  
4   Implementation Details 
As shown in Figure 1 our model consists of four main modules:  
 
 a. Crawlers: The training corpus provided by PAN-2014 contains documents in the 
XML format. However for some data sets like Twitter and Blogs, data had to be taken 
from HTML links in the XML file. Hence we had two modes of crawlers; one for 
offline data sets (Social Media and Hotel Review) and another for online data sets 
(Twitter and Blogs). 
  
b. Data Cleaning: The raw text obtained from the crawlers has to be cleaned to 
remove noisy data like „\ufffd‟, XML tags, urls, twitter user mentions, hashtags etc. 
The presence of this noisy data could affect and reduce the accuracy of the entire 
analysis. The cleaned data is then pushed into a database. 
 
c. Text Analysis: From the database the cleaned data is retrieved and we employ 
Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques on the text data for its analysis. We 
used the NLTK [12] platform for performing NLP techniques like Stemming, 
Tokenizing, Parts of Speech (POS) tagging etc. Using these techniques we extract 
features which is further divided into 3 subsets listed below:  
i. Readability Metrics: Though readability metrics were created to find the 
factors that help in making the text easy to read, it also plays a vital role in 
identifying the characteristics of the author [13]. The readability score is a 
statistical technique that computes readability based on the structure and 
1151
semantics of the sentence [14]. We use the following readability metrics for 
our analysis:  
 
a. ARI:   
 
 
 
b. Flesch Reading Ease:  
 
 
 
c. Flesch Kincaid Grade Level: 
 
 
 
d. SMOG Index:  
 
 
 
 
e. Gunning Fog Index: 
 
 
 
f. Coleman Liau Index: 
 
 
  
g. LIX: 
 
 
 
h. RIX:

ii. Function Words: For extracting the function words features we used the 
POS tagger of NLTK toolkit. We extract a total of 7 features from the text 
which include the number of nouns, adjectives, verbs, pronouns, determiners, 
adverbs and foreign words. Foreign words are those words which are mostly 
slangs used in internet like “Helloooo”, “Whaaaat”, “yipeee”, “ROFL” etc.  
 
iii. Syntactic Features: We extract the syntactic features from the text using the 
NLTK Tokenizer. We extract a total of 7 features which include number of 
single quotes, commas, periods, colons, semi-colons, question marks, 
exclamation marks etc.  
 
 
d. Classifier:  All of the 22 features collected are then fed into an ensemble classifier. 
For our analysis we used Random Forest classifier due to speed and accuracy. The 
classifier is trained with the whole data corpus and used later for testing purposes. The 
working of a cleaned test corpus is shown in Figure 2 given below.

6   Conclusion  
In this work, we present our system which identifies the age and gender of an author 
from a given document. We employed supervised Random Forest ensemble classifier 
for the Author Profiling task. We have performed our analysis on the 343013 training 
data for the English language corpus provided by the PAN-2014 organizers.  
In our future work, we would like to perform a deeper analysis on the different 
features and traits and techniques that would help to improve the efficiency of our 
current system.
