ABSTRACT 
Email plays a vital role in faster communication. Lots of mails are sent to common public with falsified 
information that appears to be a realistic. It is mandatory to trace the origin of the email and the 
authors/systems responsible for generating such emails. Representative signatures of email are to be 
generated using lexical and syntactic based methods. The signature of each email has huge dimensions and 
is called a vector/pattern. In order to make it convenient for subsequent processing, the huge dimension of 
the signature is converted into 2-dimensional pattern using Fisher’s Linear Discriminant Function (FLD). 
The 2-dimensional patterns of the signatures of emails under consideration are used as training data for the 
Radial Basis Function (RBF) network which can learn non-linear data. The classification of email is very 
well achieved due to transformation by FLD and training by RBF. The proposed method helps in building 
signature database for accurate categorization in email forensics. The proposed combination of algorithms 
helps in clustering the different emails generated by an author or by a system.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Previous authorship studies (Zheng et al., 2006; 
Stamatatos, 2009) contain lexical, syntactic (David, 
1992; Grieve, 2007; Luyckx and Daelemans, 2008), 
structural and content-specific features. Lexical features 
are used to learn about the preferred use of isolated 
characters and words of an individual. Word-based 
features including word length distribution, words per 
sentence and vocabulary richness were very effective in 
earlier authorship studies. Syntactic features, called style 
markers, consist of all purpose functional words such as 
‘though’, ‘where’, ‘your’ and punctuations like ‘!’ and ‘:’. 
The objective of this study is to create signatures for 
each email using lexical, syntactic methods. The 
signature represents uniqueness for each email and hence 
grouping of emails of an author is enhanced. The 
information in the email is based upon the thoughts an 
author. If it were handwritten, then it is still more easier 
to identify the author. However, the same behavior is 
reflected in the email created by the same author except 
the non availability of the handwritten signature in the 
email. This property really helps in identifying the author 
using the unique signature of the email. 
2. MATERIALS AND METHODS 
2.1. Materials  
The Table 1 describes the sequence of operations of 
the proposed system in this study for email authorship 
categorization. The proposed system is the combination 
of FLD and RBF algorithms: 
 
Step 1: Emails have been used from enron database. 
Step 2: Tokenize the information of the enron emails. 
Create a dictionary of information. The template 
contains functional words like preposition,

conjunctions, interjections, pronouns, verbs, 
adverbs, adjectives. This template has been used 
for filtering out irrelevant information that will 
not be used for authorship analysis. 
Step 3: Signature for each email is created by extracting 
features based on lexical characters, lexical 
words and syntactic properties. The total number 
of features for each email signature is 322. The 
details of the features (Farkhund et al., 2008; 
2010) are as follows: 
Lexical analysis based on characters: 
• Total characters per line (NC) 
• Ratio of digits to total characters (RD_T_C) 
• Ratio of letters to total characters (RL_T_C) 
• Ratio of uppercase letters to total characters 
(RUCL_T_C) 
• Ratio of spaces to total characters (RS_T_C) 
• Occurrences of alphabets to total characters (OA_T_C) 
• Occurrences of special characters: < > j { } (OSC_T) 
Lexical word based analysis: 
• Number of Words (NW) 
• Sentence length in terms of characters per Line (SL) 
• Average Token Length (ATL) 
• Ratio of short words (1 to 3 characters) to T (RSWT) 
• Ratio of word length frequency distribution to T (20 
features) (RWLF) 
• Average Sentence Length in terms of Characters 
(ASLC) 
• Ratio of characters in words to N (RCW) 
• Word which occurs only once in the email document 
(SWO) 
• Word which occurs only twice in the email 
document (TWO) 
Syntactic features: 
• Occurrences of Punctuations (OP) 
• Occurrences of Function Words (OFW) 
Find the number of words and the number of 
occurrences (frequencies) an email and all the emails 
of authors. Create a matrix with rows equivalent to 
total number of unique words extracted from all 
emails of all authors. The number of columns is 
equivalent to number authors. Fill up the columns 
with frequencies of words corresponding to respective 
authors. Each column is treated as a signature which is 
further transformed into 2-dimensional pattern. A 
labeling is done for each pattern: 
 
Step 4: The emails of each author is taken as a separate 
class. In this study, emails of 100 authors are 
grouped into 100 classes. Fishers linear discriminant 
method is used to create two projection vectors ϕ1 
and ϕ2. These projection vectors transform 322 
dimensional signature into 2 dimensional pattern. 
Fifty emails for each author has been considered 
and hence a total of 5000 (50 emails*100 authors) 
signatures are obtained. 
Step 5: Radial basis function with 75 centers (any other 
value) is used to learn 20% of emails of each author 
(Total of 10 emails×100 authors = 1000 signatures) 
to get final weights. Many neural networks are 
available, however, we preferred RBF as it learns 
non linear data effectively.

Step 6: Testing the proposed system is done by using 80% 
of 50 emails per author (Total of 40 emails×100 
authors = 4000 signatures) are used. Step 2 to step 
4 are adopted to obtain two dimensional 
signatures of the testing emails. Each signature is 
processed with the final weights obtained in step 
5. The output of the RBF is used for 
categorization of the authorship of an email. 
2.2. Methods 
2.2.1. Linear Discriminant 
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) (Sambasiva et al., 
2009) and the related Fisher's linear discriminant are 
methods used in statistics, pattern recognition and 
machine learning to find a linear combination of features 
which characterize or separate two or more classes of 
objects or events. The resulting combination may be 
used as a linear classifier. This linear classification 
can be fine tuned by applying radial basis function on 
it. The mapping of the original vector ‘X’ onto a new 
vector ‘Y’ on a plane is done by a matrix 
transformation, which is given by Equation (1 and 2): 
 
Y = AX  (1) 
 
where, X is the signatures and: 
 
T
1
T
2
A
 ϕ
=  
ϕ  
 (2) 
 
ϕ1 is a projection vector (also called a discriminant 
vector) and ϕ2 is another projection vector. 
The 2-dimensional pattern from the original 322-
dimensional vector is denoted by ‘yi
’. The vector ‘yi’  is 
given by: 
 
{ }T Ti i i i 1 i 2y (u ,v ) X ,X ,= = ϕ ϕ  (3) 
 
The vector set ‘yi’ , is obtained by projecting the 
original signatures ‘X’ of the 5000 signature patterns onto 
the space spanned by ϕ1 and ϕ2 by using Equation (3). 
2.3. Radial Basis Function 
The radial basis function is a supervised neural 
network which uses distance measure between the 
input pattern and the centers of the RBF nodes 
(Pandian and Sadiq, 2011). The summation of the 
distance is passed over an exponential activation 
function. This forms the outputs of the hidden nodes 
in the RBF network. A bias value is appended to the 
outputs of nodes in the hidden layer. The outputs of 
the hidden layer is processed with the labeled values 
(targets) assigned to obtain the final weights which 
will be used for testing. 
3. RESULTS  
The plots in Fig. 1-13 define the characteristics of 
the emails of 100 authors based on the information 
mentioned in step 3. The email can be categorized to 
an author by averaging the signatures of the emails as 
shown in Fig. 14. The brown color plot shows the 
difference among the successive authors. The average 
difference is 0.3511 that indicates that the author can 
be categorized.

Fig. 16. Projected author patterns 
 
Figure 15 presents the intersections of ϕ1 and ϕ2 
projection vectors. In Fig. 16, signatures of 100 authors 
are projected using ϕ1 and ϕ2 vectors into 2-dimension.  
4. DISCUSSION 
From this plot, very few authors signatures overlap 
and the remaining authors signatures are visible 
distinctly. In order to overcome the overlapping, RBF 
is used for correct categorization.RBF network is 
trained with projected signature patterns along with 
labeling. A final weight matrix is obtained which is 
further used to test the untrained emails. The outputs 
of RBF are categorized to a trained authors database 
else, the email is categorized to some other author 
outside the database. 
5. CONCLUSION 
This study presents the email authorship 
categorization using Fisher’s linear discriminant method 
combined with Radial basis function network. FLD 
transforms 322 dimensional signature pattern into 2-
dimensional pattern. As there is overlapping of few 
authors (Fig. 16), RBF has been used. Advantages of the 
proposed system is as follows: 
• The size of the 322-dimensional signature pattern is 
reduced to 2-dimension 
• The training of RBF is faster with less 
computational complexity 
• The size of the RBF topology is reduced from 322 to 
2 in the input layer 
• Since, the activation function used in RBF is non-
linear, the overlapping problem is solved
