Abstract
The simplest description of a plagiarism is either a ‘copy and paste’ for a text even if the source was cited or a change in 
some words by taking the meaning without citing the source, where determining the meaning is the hardest and most 
complex task.  Plagiarism can be seen as one of the cybercrime, similar to (computer viruses, computer hacking, spamming 
and the violation of copyrights), therefore, this subject has been interesting because it has become an important part of 
the ethics of scientific research. The increasing incidence of plagiarism in the higher education sector, which is considered 
acceptable behavior by some, since plagiarism saves time and effort, and gives better results, became a big problem faced 
by educational institutions. The main objective of this research is to find a suitable way to detect semantic plagiarism which 
occurs on the meaning and making use of synonyms and replace it instead of the original words. This research aims also 
to apply a pre-processing for the words of research by using tokenization and stop word removing processes, then tested 
whether the research enter under the specialization of computer science or not, where only such research will subject to 
semantic plagiarism detection by using WordNet. This research provides an effective way to detect semantic plagiarism for 
the written researches, especially by students who have a large plagiarism in their research.
1. Introduction
Detect plagiarism has become a wide research area to 
reveal its types and so as to prevent the violation of rights, 
especially in education to prevent students from copy-
right infringement and to improve the educational level. 
Plagiarism is unacceptable use of the work of another 
author either as an accurate copy, or modify it a little bit1. 
Theft of the idea can be made fraudulently, especially if 
the source is not available to the public. The plagiarist 
steal the work of others, to be the owner and thus deprive 
the owner of the original work from this benefit. Accord-
ing to the online Dictionary of  Merriam-Webster , the 
word “plagiarize” means to theft and pass off (ideas or 
words from another writing) as the owner, using (product 
of another) without citing to its source, clarify the idea by 
considering it new and innovative, while it is taken from 
present source2.
In the era of communication, websites and e-books, 
plagiarism became very easy, which makes plagiarism 
very dangerous for the breadth of  his chances, and severe 
unfaithfulness of intellectual property rights3. Plagiarism 
is a significant trouble4. The requirements of the academic 
work, especially research of it to write a thesis, its need 
to comparisons with previous research work to reveal the 
extent of literary plagiarism, so it is assumed that all uni-
versities need to measure the proportion of plagiarism and 
the scientific and literary thefts in the scientific researches 
to produce an original researches, as well as the student 
should not fear this type of program if he possessed the 
scientific secretariat, and documenting all sources, who 
takes them, this in order to avoid falling into the trap of 
scientific plagiarism.
Semantic plagiarism is a change in the meaning of 
words by taking synonyms of it, while retaining the posi-
tions of the words. There are a lot of theories in the field

of detection of plagiarism for the texts that contain sig-
nificant changes in syntax and in meaning but mostly 
inadequate and inefficient, and this represents the big-
gest challenge in the detection of these changes, because 
it requires analysis of texts that carry similar meanings 
and making a decision whether there is a plagiarism or 
not5. Despite the fact that text similarities is a quick way 
to detect text plagiarism and has acceptable performance 
in situations that are copies of the original text as it is, 
can be easily deceived when working a simple paraphras-
ing. Because of this, the use of semantic relatedness will 
improve results by solving the mysterious and difficult 
issues of plagiarism6. For two texts, if we were able to 
extract the same semantic information, these two texts are 
considered semantically similar  and can be interpreted as 
evidence that this is an issue of plagiarism.
Ordinary dictionaries cannot be suitable to be used to 
detect the complexities of meaning. Because the beneficial 
sentences consists of useful words, any system that pro-
cess natural language should possess information about 
words and their meanings7. Similarity metrics determine 
the extent of the similarity of two concepts. There are vari-
ous electronic dictionaries,  lexical databases and thesauri 
today. WordNet is one of the largest and extreme wide 
used of these. It has been used in a variety of tasks such as 
the processing of natural language, which includes ques-
tion answering and remove word meaning ambiguity. 
WordNet  is a set of free software available that make it 
possible to measure the semantic similarity or correlation 
between a pair of concepts. It offers six metrics for simi-
larity , and three metrics for relatedness, which is based 
on WordNet lexical database8. Synonymy is, of course, 
a lexical relation between word forms, in WordNet, the 
relationship that consider as the most important is the 
similarity that may be present in meanings. Two terms are 
considered synonymous when the replacement of each 
other does not change the meaning of the sentence in that 
place. Thus, according to this clarification, synonyms are 
scarce9. WordNet take into consideration the semantic 
areas of the word so that there is not only a text matching 
but looking for word meanings as well10.
Many of the techniques proposed for detect semantic pla-
giarism in documents,  11proposed a new method to detect 
paraphrased or translated text by a human by comparing 
the occurrences of citations in order to identify similarities. 
The most basic form is to measure the bibliographic cou-
pling strength. 3proposed a new method for semantic pla-
giarism using a synonym and antonym based framework 
to evaluate text similarity with respect to the similarity of 
content between the original and plagiarized document. 
12proposed a fuzzy system as a new method of plagiarism 
detection based on semantic based string similarity can 
handle external plagiarism detection as well as the fuzzy 
system can detect some means of obfuscation. 13proposed 
a Semantic way for text clustering as a new method for pla-
giarism detection by using WordNet and  lexical sequences 
to extract a group of related words semantically from texts 
that can represent the semantic content of the texts.
2. Implementation Methodology
In general, the proposed system consists of three main 
stages, each stage consists of many steps.
•	 Pre-processing Stage.
•	 Document Specialization Stage. 
•	 Semantic Plagiarism Detection Stage.
Above all, building a database has been implemented 
to store documents according to special structure. This 
database contains two types of fields,  fields to store 
an information about research and fields to store the 
research content. Fields for storing the information are: 
Public specialty of document (such as computer science, 
biology science.. etc.), specific specialization (such as 
networks, AI. etc.) and topic, while fields for storing the 
research content are: Title, keywords, abstract and finally 
the rest of the text. Whenever the database is of a large 
size, the more increased accuracy in matching data. Fig-
ure 1 explain the structure of database.

2.1 Pre-processing Stage 
This phase consists of several steps as shown in Figure 2. 
Figure 2. Pre-processing Stage.
2.1.1 Separation
In this step, the text of input document is isolated from 
the references mentioned therein. Separating the refer-
ences from the text can be manually or programmatically.
2.1.2 Tokenization
The text of the document that consists of paragraphs is 
divided into set of tokens in a process called tokenization. 
The output of this stage is to convert the file content to an 
individual words. After that, a deletion process will occur 
to the delimiters which may be a companion to these 
words. The tokenization and delimiter deletion algorithm 
can be described in 5 steps.
Step1: Declare String array text[],text2[], Declare 
String line. 
Initialize Integer C1_text, C2_text2, sum_text,sum2_
text to 0
Step2: Set line = in.readLine();             // to fetch line 
from file
Step3: Do
WHILE line is not equal to null 
set text[]=line.split(“ “); // split the line based on space 
increment sum_text; // sum = length of array text[].
ENDWHILE; Set next line by : line = in.readLine(); // 
fetch the next line 
Until (end of file). // Now, all the lines are in array 
text[].
Step4: WHILE C1_text  < sum_text          
set text2[C2_text2]= text[C1_text].replaceAll(“[\\W]”, 
“”); // delete the delimiters
Increment C1_text 
ENDWHILE; 
C2_text2=sum2_text2; // sum2= length of array text2
Step5: Print text2[C2_text2] // text2[]= individual 
words without delimiters.
The delimiters that deleted from the text are explained 
in table_1.

2.1.3 Stop Words Removing
Stop words are words that repeated frequently in the 
eEnglish language, but do not carry any information. 
These words may be kind of pronouns, conjunctions and 
prepositions. The output of this stage is a text free of stop 
word, finally puts all letters in lower case. Table_2 shown 
stop words that removed from the text.
The output of pre-processing stage is a text ready to 
check against semantic plagiarism. 
2.2 Document Disciplinary  
Before detect the semantic plagiarism, a process of identi-
fying the specialist of document is done to detect plagia-
rism only for documents that fall within the specialty of 
computer science, while the documents with other disci-
plines will not subject to plagiarism detection. Figure 3 
illustrates this process.
2.2.1 Word Frequency
After  pre-processing stage, The occurrence of each word 
in the input document will computed according to how 
many times it appears in document.
2.2.2 Descending Order
Frequencies that found in the previous step will arranged 
in descending order.
2.2.3 N Specification
At this stage, N was determined within the program that 
representing the highest frequencies will be taken from 
the total number of it.

Indian Journal of Science and TechnologyVol 9 (1) | January 2016 | www.indjst.org 4
2.2.4 Word (N)
Words that represent the highest (N) frequencies will take 
a side to reveal the correlation of source document with 
the computer science fields.
2.2.5 Specialism of Documents
The aim of this step is to accept the documents that associ-
ated only with computer sciences, this mean, if the source 
document associated with other sciences, will be rejected 
and cannot complete the work with it. Words that have 
already been taken will be matched with a new database 
contain a table including all the fields that are related to 
computer science, if one of the words resulted from previ-
ous step match one of the database fields then the docu-
ment is relevant to computer science and will subject to 
semantic plagiarism detection, while if the words doesn’t 
match any of computer science fields then the document 
will be unrelated to computer science and will reject and 
stop working. Specialist of document algorithm can be 
described in 7 steps.
Step1: Build a database containing one table involving 
the fields of computer science.

Step2: Extract the plain text from the input research.
Step3: Removes all characters except letters and puts 
everything in lowercase.
Step4: Compute the frequency for each word in the 
research.
Step5: Filtering the frequencies by taking the top 30 
one.
Step6: Taking the words that relates to these 30 
frequency.
1) For I= first field to the last field in a database table.

Step7: Display the fields that are relevant to the 
research.
2.2.6 Decision Making
Finally, the fields that are related to this document will be 
displayed and continue working.
2.3 Semantic Plagiarism Detection
Then, to help detecting semantic plagiarism, we propose 
to use semantic similarity between documents based on 
information extracting techniques. semantic plagiarism 
will be detect based on WordNet, it has several steps as 
shown in Figure 4.
Figure 4. Semantic Plagiarism Detection.
2.3.1 Text
If the document passed from the threshold of specialty 
test of computer science, the text will be taken once again 
to complement this work.
2.3.2 Algorithm
Only the algorithm or the proposed system contained in 
the document is subject to detect semantic plagiarism.
2.3.3 WordNet
After taking the text that was specified in the previous 
step, to determine the extent of the semantic plagiarism, 
synonyms for each word is to find using WordNet. Every 
word in the specified text will be extracted its synonyms. 
These synonyms will be considered as appearance of the 
word itself when used to detect plagiarism.
2.3.4 WordNet Expansion
At this stage, WordNet expansion has been proposed by 
specific words doesn’t exist in its dictionary. words were 
clarified in table_3.
2.3.5 Documents of Database
At this stage, the documents stored  in the database will 
be withdrawn one after another, for these documents, 
the text is taken entirely not just a specific text in it, to 
the possibility of plagiarize a text exist in different places 
of database document and put it in another place of 
source document, these places may be abstract, results,

conclusions, or the proposed system. After that, WordNet 
will be applied on these documents to find the synonyms.
2.3.6 Check Semantic Plagiarism
Most important step in our work is plagiarism detection 
process that has been implemented based on the mean-
ing of words and their positions, if the plagiarist change 
the meaning of words but the words remain in the same 
sites where in the original text, this is a semantic plagia-
rism and this is what has been discussed. In this work, 
the word in the algorithm of the source document will 
be searched for in the document drawn from the data-
base. if this word or one of its synonyms is found then 
will checked the words after the first word in the same 
context and if it in the same locations in the document 
drawn, this will be considered as semantic plagiarism, but 
if the words or its synonyms are found, but in a different 
order of what exists in the document drawn then this is 
not considered as semantic plagiarism.
3. Discussion
The proposed system steps in this research was applied 
to many of the documents using the Java NetBeans IDE 
8.0.2 language. No matter what the type of document, for 
any case, it will be converted to Text to be handled accord-
ing to the system. Meanwhile, the database was built by 
MySQL workbench 6.3 CE program and the connector 
between java program and database is MySQL Commu-
nity Server (GPL) version of 5.7.9 in 3306 port.
The database has a capacity of storage equal to 500,000 
documents. Size of each document can range between 
1-50 sheet. The database is made up of several fields in 
which to store documents, firstly, an general information 
about the document to be stored was entered, this infor-
mation is public specialization, then specific specializa-
tion and finally topic. The type of fields that contain the 
text of this information is Varchar (255 char). Secondly, 
the contents of the document are stored in fields, which 
are, title, abstract, keywords and the rest of the content. 
The type of title and keywords fields is Varchar, while the 
type of abstract field is TEXT(65,535 char) and finally the 
type of rest field that contain the remaining text of the file 
is LONG TEXT (4,294,967,295 char).
In this research, work was based on WordNet to give 
the synonyms to the words in the document, the syn-
onyms will consider as occurrence for the same word. The 
input is document file and the output is a report about 
the semantic plagiarism that occurs in the algorithm or 
proposed system between the source document and other 
documents stored in the database. Table_4 shown the 
semantic plagiarism percentages for one source docu-
ment with 100 database documents.
Accordingly to the values mentioned in Table_4, it 
was found a semantic plagiarism in algorithms or the 
proposed system of document when compared with the 
documents of database. Detect semantic plagiarism is 
by finding synonyms for words and inspect their sites, 
if there was stability in sites and the plagiarist has only 
replaced the word in one of its synonyms, this is con-
sidered as a semantic plagiarism. The run time required 
to get the matching result is 6 seconds. The following 
diagram shows the percentages for semantic plagiarism 
detection process.
According to the diagram shown in Figure 5, semantic 
plagiarism has been detected in a sample of 100 docu-
ments stored in the database with different percentages, 
where the highest percentage is 0.53%  and least percent-
age is 0%.
4. Conclusion
This paper, describes an approach to detect semantic pla-
giarism which occurs in researches by using WordNet. In 
this approach, WordNet has proven as an effective way to 
identify the semantic plagiarism by given the synonyms 
of words in the document then detect the plagiarism, 
Then, is to know the change in the words locations that 
have been changed by other synonymous words. If there 
is no change in words locations as it exists in the database

document, then, there is a semantic plagiarism. In this 
work, the WordNet has expanded to be an entrance to 
other research where it has been added a several meanings 
of certain words and included in WordNet to be utilized 
to detect the semantic plagiarism.
