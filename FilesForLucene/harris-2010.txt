Abstract
The rongorongo writing system of Easter Island is the only example of writing in Polynesia.  The 
structural properties of the script and the few remaining inscriptions has complicated decipherment 
work  for  many  years.   With  the  development  of  sophisticated  language  and  word-frequency 
distribution  models  (Zipf,  1949;  Baayen,  2001),  and text  classification (Mosteller  and Wallace, 
1964; Landauer  and Dumais, 1997; Landauer et al., 2002; 2004; 2007; Manning et al., 2008), the 
issues relating to the study of large multilingual corpora can be addressed.  This study adopts a 
mixed-methods approach and evaluates methods for classifying the rongorongo texts according to 
their literary-genre.  Although there is still work to be done in determining the types of literary-
genre produced by rongorongo scribes, it is believed a classification of the texts, will restore some 
contextual information to enable future studies to identify some of the structural-principles behind 
the productivity of particular glyphs. 
The  paper  highlights  the  empirical  issues  relating  to  the  use  of  multilingual-corpora,  word-
frequency distributions and dealing with different sample-sizes.  The Barthel (1958) corpus is tested 
for the optimum representation for statistical exploration.  Furthermore, the results validate previous 
conclusions regarding the presence of shared passages (Barthel, 1958; Fischer, 1997; Sproat, 2003; 
Guy, 2006; Horley, 2007a; 2009; 2010; Melka, 2008; 2009b; 2010), and literary-genre (Butinov and 
Knorozov, 1957; Barthel,  1958; Guy, 1985; 1990; Fischer, 1997; Davletshin, 2002; Berthin and 
Berthin, 2006; Melka, 2008; 2009a; 2009b; 2010; Wieczorek, 2010).  The final results will provide 
a possible foundation for further exploration of literary-genre in the rongorongo corpus and a series 
of methods can produce robust statistical measures.

Chapter 1 Introduction
Rongorongo is the undeciphered writing system of Rapanui (Easter Island), discovered in 1864.  In 
terms of the lack of an agreed decipherment, the situation according to Steven Fischer, is that ‘after 
130-odd years [now 150 years, my note], there is still no complete translation of Easter Islands 
rongorongo inscriptions’ (Fischer 1997:263)1.  
So why decipher a forgotten writing system?  Aside from the academic challenge, the rongorongo 
tablets can no doubt contribute to our current understanding of the culture that flourished on Easter 
Island, and a particularly interesting question that needs to be addressed is: what was so important 
to the Rapanui, that it had to be written down?   
This  paper  uses  corpus-based  techniques,  including  lexicostatistics,  and  text  classification  or 
authorship-attribution  methods  to  establish  whether  the  corpus  of  rongorongo tablets  can  be 
categorised according to the scribe who produced them, or the literary-genre they represent, which 
will help to evaluate previous methods and hypotheses regarding rongorongo genres (Butinov and 
Knorozov, 1957; Barthel, 1958; Fedorova, 1978; Guy, 1985, 1990; Pozdniakov, 1996; Pozdniakov 
and Pozdniakov,  2007;  Fischer,  1997;  Berthin and Berthin,  2006;  Horley,  2007a;  2010;  Melka, 
2008,  2009a,  2009b,  2010;  Wieczorek,  2010).   This  paper  focuses  on the  methods adopted  by 
Mosteller and Wallace (1964), Biber, et al., (1998), Baayen (1994; Baayen et al., 1996; Baayen, 
2001; Baayen, 2002; Baayen, 2008), Landauer, (et al., 2004),  and Gries (2009). 
 
Only one genre is confirmed, or at least agreed upon, by the majority of researchers; namely, that 
the  Mamari tablet (Ca and  Cb) appears to be some form of lunar calendar, (Barthel, 1958; Guy, 
1990, Berthin and Berthin, 2006; Melka, 2009a, 2009b, 2010).  In addition, one side of the Keiti 
tablet  (Er1-Er8),  may  also  bear  some  calendar-sequences,  (see  Butinov  and  Knorozov,  1957; 
Wieczorek, 2010).  Fischer (1997) concludes that the majority of the tablets represent procreation 
chants, based on the structure of the Santiago staff (Ia) and its apparent structural-parallels with the 
tradition Atua mata-riri  (Thomson, 1889).  These analyses relay on qualitative descriptions of the 
glyphs combined with an internal  structural  analysis2,  but with little in the way of quantitative 
1.  Inferring that his proposed decipherment has provided a partial solution, although there is still no consensus among the research 
community that any part of the inscriptions have yet been successfully deciphered.
2.  A method similar to distribution analysis, which is a structural-linguistic method, which identifies the, 'systematic relations and 
structural properties of language elements', involving segmentation and substitution used by linguists to analyse unknown languages. 
This method has been shown to identify the direction of writing and make proposals for the underlying inventory of basic signs, (see 
Coulmas, 1996: 132).

support (see however, Barthel, 1958; Horley, 2005; 2007; Pozdniakov and Pozdniakov, 2007; for 
examples of statistical analysis).  This paper would like to address this need for further statistical 
analysis by pulling together several different methods in linguistics capable of identifying structures 
and stylistic “finger prints” present in corpora.
 
Applying  corpus-linguistic  methods will  identify the  100 most  productive  glyphs  (or  features), 
which  form the  basis  for  authorship-attribution  methods,  namely:  principal  component  analysis 
(PCA), factor analysis, and latent semantic analysis (LSA). These methods are capable of drawing 
out structures present in multivariate data (see Baayen, 2008). Lexicostatistic methods will enable 
the study to address the issue underlying corpus linguistics; the comparison of texts with different 
sample-sizes.   This  involves  modelling  the  distribution  of  word  frequencies  and  measuring 
vocabulary growth as a test of lexical-richness, commonly using statistical models based on Zipfs-
law (Baayen, 2001; Baroni, 2006).   
Word frequency data, KWIC concordances (Key Word In Context, see Summers 1993; Biber et al., 
1998; Gries, 2009), and an analysis of collocations (bi-grams and tri-grams, see Baayen, 2008) will 
identify compound glyphs and their given context.  Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) will describe 
the correlation between a group of texts and the strength of that correlation, providing a faster, 
though computationally expensive, solution to traditional corpus-methods (word-frequency counts 
and KWIC concordances).  In terms of the validation of results, previous research, including the 
identified parallel-passages, will act as a means to measure the success of text classification, in 
combination with n-gram counts and KWIC concordances.
These methods are applied to a second corpus of oral  traditions in three Polynesian languages: 
Rapanui, Marquesan, and Maori.  This corpus is used for experimental purposes (see results section, 
particularly, factor analysis, VGC, and LSA).  The assumption is that a genealogy, whether present 
in  the  language  corpora  or  the  rongorongo corpus,  is  likely to  have  a  high  degree  of  lexical-
richness.  This is due to genealogies generally consisting of a list of individual names; they will 
therefore have more words with a low frequency of occurrence (i.e. hapax-legomena).  A chant or 
song, on the other hand, may contain repeated or formulaic expressions, and will be less lexically-
rich than genealogies, where some words are repeated many times over (see reconstructed form of 
Atua-mata-riri, 'god angry-eyes'  in Fischer, 1997).   Therefore, the data produced by the above 
methods may allow for the categorisation of texts or textual fragments into their respective groups 
based on the productivity of stable glyph-sequences.  
9
Naturally, it is not possible to hint at what 'genre' the groups may represent; for example, are they 
grouped  according  to  the  individual  writing-style  of  the  scribe,  or  by  the  genre  of  the  text 
(procreation chant versus calendar), or a mixture of the two?  Indeed, the absence of a glyph or 
group of glyphs, on a tablet, may enlighten us as to what motivates their productivity: for example, 
based on previous studies of the  Mamari tablet (a likely calendar, see Barthel, 1958; Guy, 1990; 
Horley,  2009;  Melka,  2009a;  2009b;  2010),  can  other  tablets  containing  similar  features  or 
structures  be  classified  as  calendars,  or  at  least,  sequences  of  important  dates?   If  methods in 
authorship-attribution can discriminate between tablets with shared features, then it will be possible 
to retrieve some form of contextual information, which has not been consistently recorded in early 
records.
The notation adopted here,  identifies  rongorongo glyphs with the greater  and lesser  than signs 
'<...>', and a forward slash '/.../' for phonetic descriptions. The zero-padding in the Barthel (1958) 
corpus  has  been  removed  to  enable  the  transcription  to  line  up  with  glyph  images  wherever 
possible, and accordingly, the same convention is applied in the discussion to enable comparison, 
(not to be confused with the transliteration scheme proposed by Horley, 2005).  The study is divided 
into five main sections. The first of these will address the principles that should be adopted when 
approaching writing from a linguistic perspective, combined with a literary review of past research, 
with particular emphasis on information elicited about the contents, or literary genre, of the tablets 
(see chapter two).  
Chapter  three  discusses  the  corpora  and the  stages  involved in  pre-processing.   The  following 
chapter  introduces  the   methodology,  evaluating  the  benefits  and  shortcomings associated  with 
corpus linguistic and authorship-attribution based studies.  The fifth chapter presents the results of 
PCA and  factor  analysis,  a  comparative  analysis  of  relative  word-frequencies  and  vocabulary 
growth curves, and a final section dedicated to latent semantic analysis, with an overview of its 
utility in identifying lexical or grammatical-association patterns (Biber et al., 1998).  An Egyptian 
corpus is introduced to evaluate LSA methods applied to a deciphered writing system, allowing the 
analysis  to  be  extended to  glyphs,  resulting  in  more  transparent  results  than  achieved  with  an 
undeciphered writing system.     
  
The final chapter will review what the study has achieved and some suggestions for future research, 
which may  contribute to the decipherment of the  rongorongo script  and the messages that the 
10
tablets contain. 
It is hoped that the results presented here will provide quantitative support for some of the previous 
suggestions  that  have  been  made  concerning  literary  genre  and  the  rongorongo tablets.   A 
decipherment of the  rongorongo script is beyond the scope of this paper and the data, however, 
what this paper does aim to achieve is the categorisation of the inscriptions into their respective 
groups or 'genres' and restore some contextual information to the inscriptions.

Chapter 2 Writing systems and the rongorongo script
2.1 Empirical issues relating to writing systems research and rongorongo 
Before any analysis,  it  is important to clarify some of the assumptions underlying the study of 
writing  systems.   This  section  outlines  some  key principles  proposed  by  Coulmas  (2003)  for 
approaching writing systems from a linguistic perspective.  Firstly, an outline of the terminology 
used in the rest of this paper with regards to writing.  The term, 'script' is defined along the lines of 
Sproat (2000), who states that a script is considered to be, 'a set of distinct marks conventionally 
used to represent the written form of one or more languages', (Sproat, 2000:25).  In this analysis it is 
assumed that the language underlying rongorongo is a Polynesian one, and one which is likely to 
reflect  the  linguistic  conventions  of  an  older  form of  the  modern  day  Rapanui  language.   In 
addition,  the term 'glyph'  will  refer to,  'a written symbol with a particular shape',  regardless of 
whether  it  could  be  sub-divided  in  to  smaller  constituents,  (see  Guy,  1982;  Horley,  2005; 
Pozdniakov and Pozdniakov, 2007). 
Two main assumptions need addressing with regards to writing. Firstly, there is no necessary one-
to-one  correspondence  between  the  elements  of  a  writing  system and  the  linguistic  units  it  is 
supposed to represent:  For example, in the case of the proto-form of the Cuneiform syllabary: a 
specific social context (accounting) and glyphs represent semantic categories, and the arrangement 
of  signs  has  little  to  do  with  the  linear  arrangement  of  speech.   Phonetic  values  were  later 
introduced, but played only a minor role. (Damerow, 2006:4; see also Hyman, 2006).  Therefore it 
can  not  be  assumed that  a  sequence  of  glyphs  represents  a  string of  phonemes,  nor  can  it  be 
concluded that as with other examples of writing,  rongorongo  represents a form of proto-writing 
with nothing but semantic categories.  Proto-cuneiform tended to be tabular in form reflecting its 
use as a device for recording economic transactions. The Rongorongo glyphs on the other hand are 
arranged linearly, and the bhostrophedon nature of the script allowed for continuous chanting by 
rotating the tablet  through 180 degrees every other  line (see Jaussen,  1893b; Routledge,  1919; 
Metraux, 1940; Fischer, 1997, and the appendix).  Therefore, the social or economic context may 
also have an influence on the structural properties of a script.
Secondly,  we can not  interpret  non-Western writing systems according to a  Western-concept  of 
writing (Coulmas 2003).  In other words, with preconceived ideas on how the writing system should 
work.  One case in point is given by the informant sessions between Metero and Bishop Jaussen 
12
(1893b).  Jaussen believed that the tablets could be deciphered by eliciting each word from his 
informant, and assigning the word to the relevant glyph in relation to the position in the oral chant, 
in his own words:
I had as many gathering of words, separated one from the other, as there  
were  signs  in  one  line  of  the  tablet;  and  as  a  person  could,  without  
knowledge of the language, by counting exactly, place each sign above the  
word that is its proper meaning. 
(Jaussen, 1893b:253; cf. Fischer, 1997:52) 
This one-to-one correspondence between the words of his informants' chant and the glyphs did not 
produce any coherent results, partly because the assignment of phonetic values was performed in 
the absence of his informant (see Fischer, 1997:53).  As noted by Coulmas (2003:33) 'there is no 
perfect  fit  between the linguistic constructs that  are functional in speech and writing',  which is 
primarily caused by the fact that writing systems are 'static', whilst speech is 'dynamic' in nature, as 
seen from evidence in historical linguistic studies: for example, Indo-European was the predecessor 
or proto-language of modern English, French, German, and Hindi.  These have become mutually 
unintelligible over time, whilst  retaining some correspondences through their  common ancestral 
root.
Coulmas (2003:33) proposes four main assumptions regarding writing and its relationship to the 
spoken language. Three of these assumptions will be adopted in this paper: writing and speech are 
distinct systems; they are related in a variety of complex ways; speech and writing have both shared 
and distinct functions.  These assumptions are the basis for three principles, which constitute the 
key reasons why linguists should study writing as a system of communication (Coulmas, 2003:33).
2.2  The principle of the autonomy of the graphic system
Under this principle, writing systems are considered to be structured, consequently allowing them to 
be analysed in terms of 'functional units and relationships', (Coulmas, 2003:34), in the same way 
that linguists analyse the components of speech. 
The arrangement of the graphic signs is restricted by rules, which govern their 'linear arrangement 
in  forming  large  expressions',  (Coulmas,  2003:34);  this  mirrors  language  where  syntax  places 
restrictions on the ordering of linguistic constituents, i.e. subject and object.
13
A question that needs addressing under this principle is: 'What are the basic operational units of the 
system', (Coulmas, 1991:49), in other words, what units could be considered as forming the main 
inventory of signs that define the writing system?  
A number  of  proposals  have  been  made  in  connection  with  rongorongo.   One  extreme  is  the 
mnemonic-aid hypothesis, where glyphs allow the reader to recall parts of chants that they have 
previously memorised, motivated by the belief that, 'pictographies generally have more variety and 
richness in the choice of figures and symbols', (Metraux, 1940:404).  Other researchers conclude 
that  rongorongo has  a  logographic  or  logo-phonetic  system similar  to  Egyptian,  'in  which  the 
auxiliary parts  of speech and affixes  may easily be omitted',  (Butinov and Knorozov,  1957:16; 
Davletshin,  2002:4);  a mixed syllabary (Pozdniakov and Pozdniakov, 2007; Guy,  2006; Horley, 
2005);  or  a  combination  of  all  three:  a  script  with  syllabic,  logographic,  and  semasiographic 
properties (Fischer, 1998:5).
A statistical analysis (Horley, 2005:114; Pozdniakov and Pozdniakov, 2007), reveals that the script 
is likely to be syllabic in accordance with the structure of the Rapanui language.  The phonology of 
the Rapanui language allows for syllables of type (C)V only. Consequently, there are no 'closed 
syllables' or 'consonant clusters' of type CVC, CCV, CVCC, or CCVC.  In addition, 'morphological 
considerations do not affect the division in syllables', and hence the only division between syllables 
is either 'before a consonant if there is one otherwise between vowels', De Feu (1996:186).  
Metraux (1940) observed that glyphs appear either in isolation or linked together.  This form of 
conjunction is intentional, with Metraux concluding that 'these compound signs have no definite 
meaning of  their  own independent  of  the elements  which compose them',  (Metraux 1940:401). 
Therefore, he concludes that compound forms are derived by  'cursive writing' conventions. One 
argument against this view is given by Kudrjavtsev (1949) who observed stable sequences of glyphs 
believed to be the same inscription repeated across several tablets. These are termed the 'parallel-
passages'  and  provide  evidence  of  alloglyphic  variants.   These  illustrate  part  of  the  script's 
composition,  and the features that may form the main constituents3.   The parallel-passages also 
show  that  glyphs  joined  together  on  one  tablet  are  sometimes  carved  individually  on  others, 
(Barthel, 1958:151-168); see for example tablet H, versus tablet P and Q, or Gr versus K, in figure 1 
below.
3.   For  sign  lists  reducing the current  Barthel  (1958)  sign  inventory to  approximately 50 main  signs,  see  Horley,  (2005:112);

The tablets are identified with the letters A-Z, and each side with r and v (recto/verso where the 
tablets' starting point is agreed upon), or an a or b (where the beginning of the tablet is unknown). 
In addition, the proceeding number indicates the line number on the tablet.  The period and 
semicolon, denote affixed and fused glyphs, respectively, and an asterisk indicates the end of a line.

Figure 1. Two sets of parallel-passages between four tablets (1.a), and a group of two (1.b) tablets.
The parallel-passages show the glyphs acting as affixes, compounding, reduplication, and hint at 
possible  allographs.   Note the differences  in head and arm shape,  and missing elements in the 
15
examples (H, P, and Q) and (Gr, K).  Metraux believed that these differences have no implications 
for understanding the script, stating it to be, 'inconceivable that a particular significance would be 
given to the presence or absence of an arm or a leg, the position of the head, or the form of the 
hand', (Metraux, 1940:401).
 
In summary, the current assumptions regarding the nature of the script's typology and the support 
given by statistical analysis, (Horley, 2005; Pozdniakov and Pozdniakov, 2007) would indicate that 
rongorongo is likely to be a syllabary, with a small set of logograms perhaps representing the most 
frequent functional unit, or the most revered; for example, glyph <600> possibly represents a bird-
motif  attributed  to  the  god  makemake  (Metraux,  1940:311),   or   glyph  <50>,  which  may  be 
associated with fertility rites  (Routledge,  1919),  and are  found on the island rocks (Lee,  1992; 
McLaughlin, 2004).
2.3  The principle of interpretation
Writing systems follow a structure, whether, 'phonetic, phonemic, morphophonemic', or 'lexical', 
(Coulmas, 2003:34).  Analysing a writing system requires an awareness of how the elements relate 
to the linguistic structures and units.   This refers to orthographic depth,  or what Sproat (2000) 
terms, the 'orthographically relevant level' (ORL), (Sproat, 2000:10), which is divided into deep and 
shallow,  or  opaque  and  transparent.   This  describes  how  closely  the  script  represents  the 
phonological system of the language.  A shallow orthography is a script like Finnish or Spanish, 
where there is a one-to-one correspondence between a grapheme and a phoneme.  Whereas, a deep 
orthography,  like  Hànzi (Chinese),  shows  a  one-to-many  relationship  between  grapheme  and 
phoneme.  The way in which scholars previously tackled decipherment4 involved, 'identifying the 
underlying language and reconstructing the way it  is  coded in the written symbols'  (Damerow, 
2006:1).  This has been successful in the case of Egyptian and Cuneiform where a large corpus of 
texts have been preserved.  It should be acknowledged however, that the earlier systems of writing 
had very little to do with spoken language, and so the philological methods adopted by researchers 
are not as effective where the relationship between speech and writing is weak, (Damerow, 2006:1). 
In addition, without prior knowledge of the underlying language it becomes even more difficult to 
find a solid basis for decipherment.  Etruscan, for example is a non-Indo European language, which 
thrived in  Italy around 1200-100 BC (Bonfante  and Bonfante,  2002:3),  but  adopted  the  Greek 
4.  Methods include the analysis of bilingual texts, and the re-construction of sign-lists.  See the decipherments of Egyptian, Linear B, 
and Mayan (Robinson, 2002). 
16
script, complicating any decipherment work.  
Although it is not currently possible to draw conclusions regarding the mapping of any particular 
rongorongo glyph to  a  phoneme,  researchers  believe  that,  'it  is  possible  to  isolate  independent 
groups of words, and […] more important, single words from the continuous text', (Butinov and 
Knorozov, 1957:10), and statistical studies indicate that, 'the average glyph may consist of about 
three  elements  corresponding  to  letters  or  two  elements  of  a  certain  syllabic  value',  (Horley, 
2005:108).
Pozdniakov and Pozdniakov (2007) state that any analysis attributing a logographic reading to the 
rongorongo script,  ‘conflict  with  the  frequency  distribution  of  the  glyphs’,  (Pozdniakov  and 
Pozdniakov 2007:11).  According to their study, there are 52 glyphs (Pozdniakov and Pozdniakov, 
2007:8), with the highest frequency in the corpus, which with approximately 55 possible syllables 
in the Rapanui language is, ‘itself a weighty argument in support of the hypothesis’ that the glyphs 
represent syllables, (Pozdniakov and Pozdniakov  2007:11).
However, later on in their analysis they appear to class  rongorongo as a mixed script with both 
logographic and syllabic elements.  After an analysis of word-length in both corpora, it appears that, 
‘the average length of a word in the Rapanui language coincides almost exactly with the average 
length of a word in the written texts’, (Pozdniakov and Pozdniakov  2007:14). 
Pozdniakov and Pozdniakov (2007:31) account for the issues associated with divergent statistics 
between  the  rongorongo script  and  the  Rapanui  language,  by  proposing  the  presence  of 
'determinative'  or  'reduplicator'  glyphs  (glyphs  <3>  or  <200>)  and  changes  in  meaning  or 
phonology through mirroring: where an element of a glyph such as the head, faces in the opposite 
direction to the established reading order of left-to-right (Jaussen, 1893b; Kudrjavtsev, 1949). They 
attribute this behaviour to reduplication of the morpheme (Pozdniakov and Pozdniakov, 2007:32). 
This is not necessarily an incorrect assumption given, as mentioned previously, that writing and 
speech are distinct systems for different communicative needs, but this proposal has not yet been 
confirmed or further investigated.  
Another  characteristic  of  the  script  is  the  constant  repetition  of  small  stable  glyph-sequences5, 
5.  Glyph sequence <380.1.(3)> appears on a sub-grouping of tablets, for example the London (K), Small Santiago (Gr), Mamari (C), 
Echancree (D), and Small Vienna tablets.
17
which may represent, 'independent phraseological units or single words' (Butinov and Knorozov 
1957:11),  a  conclusion  paralleled  by  Metraux  (1940:401),  'if  the  signs  are  a  form of  writing 
corresponding to words and syllables, groups or sequences of them will be repeated many times, 
especially for a Polynesian language'.  A further proposal is that some elements may be omitted by 
the scribe, for example glyph <39>, possibly representing the particle te, which, if verified, would 
not  cause  any significant  change at  the  semantic  level,  (Butinov and Knorokov,  1957;  Horley, 
2005:114).  As a result, it should not be assumed that the glyphs can be assigned phonetic content 
due  to  the  possible  existence  of  'semantic  classifiers'  represented  by the  delimiter  groups  (see 
Horley 2005), and further complications caused by the probable high-level of polysemy (see Guy, 
2006; Fischer, 1997; Horley, 2007a; 2009; Melka, 2009a).
In conclusion, on the basis of previous research the assumption made here is that the rongorongo 
script is a mixed system with an inventory consisting of logographic and syllabic glyphs.  It is 
possible that there are additional glyphs in the inventory that have a special function or provide a 
shorthand version of a more complex glyph.  How much logography is present in the script is still 
debated, and new studies posit a gestural function to some glyphs (the  sequence <480.2-483-2-480-
2>, at the start of line Cb10 on the Mamari tablet, (Melka, 2010).  This can not be ruled out due to 
the autonomy of writing (Coulmas, 1996:27).  Therefore, it is necessary for the ORL of rongorongo 
to be determined in order to provide better grounds for decipherment.  This would require a entirely 
new study beyond the scope of this paper (see the further research section for a preliminary study).
2.4  The principle of historicity
It is assumed that writing developed at a latter phase of human history when it became necessary to 
keep  records  of  transactions,  or  levels  of  production,  as  seen  by  the  developmental  phases 
undergone  by  Cuneiform  into  a  syllabary  capable  of  writing  down  different  languages  (from 
Sumerian to  Akkadian,  though with slight  variations).   Writing is  therefore considered to be a, 
'technological development',  which has only been 'independently invented four times in history' 
(Sproat  2000:21),  namely the Hieroglyphs  (Egypt),  Cuneiform (Sumer),  Jiăgŭwén (China,  later 
known as Hànzi), and Mayan (Central America). That is to say, that these writing systems were not 
the product of cultural diffusion due to close contact between one group of people and another. 
Rongorongo is another writing system that appears to have been developed independently and in 
relative isolation.
18
The rongorongo tablets where discovered by Joseph Eugéne Eyraud who visited Rapanui in 1864. 
The purpose of his visit was to survey the island on behalf of the Congrégation des Sacrés Coeurs 
and to establish a Catholic mission there.  During his stay he became aware of wooden boards 
wrapped in leaves suspended from the rafters of the Rapanui huts:
One finds in all the houses wooden tablets or staffs covered with sorts of  
hieroglyphic  characters.  These  are  figures  of  animals  unknown  on  the  
island, which the natives trace by means of sharp stones. 
(Altman, 2004:21)
The term  rongorongo derives from  te kohau rongorongo, which is translated as ‘the stick of the 
rongorongo men’. Metraux (1940: 389).  Prior to this designation, the script was referred to as taa 
or he timo (Fischer 1997:35). The script is classified as a boustrophedon writing system; the reader 
starts reading from the bottom-left corner, and reads along until the end of the line whereupon the 
tablet is turned 180o and reading continues left-to-right, first noticed by Maklai (Fischer 1997:39), 
confirmed later in informant sessions by Jaussen (1893b), Thomson (1889), Routledge (1919:244), 
and by comparison of the glyphs in the parallel-passages (Kudrjavtsev, 1949). This method may 
have  allowed for  continuous  chanting,  or  prevented  the  reader  from missing  a  line  of  glyphs, 
(Metraux, 1940:405; Fischer, 1997:353).
According to Thomson's informants, the first king to arrive on Rapanui, Hotu-Matua, 'possessed the 
knowledge  of  this  written  language,  and  brought  with  him  to  the  island  sixty-seven  tablets 
containing allegories, traditions, genealogical tables, and proverbs relating to the land from which 
he  had migrated'.  (Thomson,  1889:514).   The  first  evidence  of  Rapanui  'writing',  is  seen on a 
document presented by Gonzalez y Haedo to the islanders, when a Spanish expedition annexed the 
island in 1770.  The signatures on the document are composed of linear and abstract signs, with a 
couple  resembling  rongorongo glyphs  (Horley,  2005).    Metraux  (1940:400)  dismisses  these 
signatures as 'meaningless scrawls not connected to the tablets', although he does acknowledge that 
the 'bird figure' may be a possible exception (glyph <400>).
Other  research  concludes  that  rongorongo may have  been  the  result  of  contact  with  this  1770 
Spanish expedition (see  Bastian,  1872;  Emory,  1968;  Fischer,  1997;  1998;  Facchetti,  2002);  a 
cultural solution to the encoding of language, flourishing during the period leading up to 1860-4, 
but only lasting approximately three generations (Fisher, 1998:3). Horley (2005:115) argues that it 
is, ‘reasonable to assume that the rongorongo script was already developed before the contact with 
19
Europeans’.  Horley (2005:115) shows that some signs on the document can be traced to known 
rongorongo glyphs  and  motifs  that  are  inscribed  on  skulls,  and  as  petroglyphs  on  rocks  (see 
Metraux, 1940:399), and  moai hats (see also Guy, 1985; Lee, 1992; McLaughlin, 2004; Melka, 
2009a).  
A knowledge of the written characters was confined to the royal family, the chiefs of the six districts 
(into which the island was divided), sons of those chiefs, and certain priests or teachers. (Thomson, 
1889:514). There are a number of reports that show the tablets were used for chanting, and that 
there existed a tradition of transmission facilitated by readings of the tablets on public occasions, 
(Routledge, 1919). Thomson's (1889) report also supports this: 
[…] people were assembled at Anekena Bay once each year to [h]ear all of  
the  tablets  read.  The  feast  of  the  tablets  was  regarded  as  their  most  
important fête day, and not even war was allowed to interfere with it. 
(Thomson, 1889:514)  
2.5  Literary genres of the rongorongo inscriptions
In order to assess the success or failure of any statistical analysis in identifying groups of similar 
inscriptions, it is important to study previous ethnographic evidence and research.  Roussel reports 
that the close ancestors of a number of his informants could still read the script and the tablets 
contained the history of their island, (see Fischer, 1997:36; Altman, 2004).
Meinicke (1871:550-551) proposes that the tablets were ancient genealogical texts of island ariiki 
(chiefs); this belief was dismissed by another researcher, Bastian (1872), who instead argues that 
they contain songs that were memorised and recited at festivals.  This would entail that the script 
was developed after European contact rather than through ancient origins (cf. Fischer 1997:40-42). 
 
According to Metraux (1940:395) there have been no reports elicited by him or Routledge (1919) 
that  any of  the tablets  contained genealogies,  lists  of  chiefs,  or  the origins and exploits  of the 
Rapanui, which conflicts with native tradition reported by Thomson (1889).  Therefore, there is still 
no agreement  as  to  what  the  rongorongo inscriptions  represent  in  terms of  literary genre.  Ray 
(1932:155) believes the rongorongo tablets are, ‘a collection of more or less symbolic reminders of 
objects or actions which would serve the native orator as notes of a discourse on history, a prayer, or 
20
even an inventory’, agreeing with Thomson (1889).  
Butinov  and  Knorokov  (1957),  propose  that  some  tablets  are  genealogies,  namely  the  Small  
Santiago tablet (G):  based on the composition of the glyphs and repeated sequences (Butinov and 
Knorozov 1957:7-8, 15).  In addition, they believe that,  ‘one tablet could have several different 
texts’,  (Butinov  and Knorozov,  1957:8),  given  statistical  evidence  that  shows  glyph  sequences 
representing  a  lunar  series  on  one  side  of  the  Keiti  tablet,  (Wieczorek,  2010).  Fischer  (1997; 
1998:5) however, suggests that the majority of the tablets are likely to represent procreation chants 
due to their triadic structure and the high productivity of 'the phallus', glyph <76>, on the Santiago 
staff, which represents a semasiograph meaning 'copulated with'.  However, there is still some doubt 
whether this hypothesis holds as some tablets lack this suffix.
Barthel (1958), proposed that the tablets could be categorised along the following lines:
Aruku-kurenga(B) - Grt. Washington(S)
Grt. Washington(R) - Tahua(A) - Grt. Santiago(H)          Keiti(E) - Sm. Santiago(G) - Santiago staff(I) - Honolulu(T) 
Mamari(C) - Sm. Vienna(N)
Figure 2.  Classification of tablets by shared glyph-sequences, (Barthel, 1958:167).
The above paradigm illustrates four main groups of tablets.  Barthel (1958:1968) shows that there is 
some overlap with text C having sequences in common with R, A and H.  In addition, text G can be 
split according to side, with Gr sharing sequences with N and E, and sections of C and S.  Barthel 
(1958) attributes Gv as being similar to texts I and T.  This classification is agreed upon by previous 
research (Metraux, 1940; Butninov and Knorozov, 1957; Fischer, 1997; Horley, 2007a; 2010). 
To complicate the issue, as well as more than one text-type being inscribed on a tablet, it may also 
be the case that each genre of inscription, 'held its own formulaic requirement', or 'different reading 
techniques',  (Fischer,  1997:283).   According  to  Fischer  (1997),  ethnographic  data  supports  the 
tablets being thematically-grouped, with one acting as a summary or inventory of one or more other 
tablets.   An example is  observed in the apparent 'close connection between the two inscription 
categories  of   'ika and  timo.  […]'  (Fischer,  1997:285).  These  categories  where  recorded  by 
Routledge (1919) during her work with an informant who confirmed that, 'a connected, or possibly 
the same, tablet was made at the instance of the relatives of the victim and helped to secure his 
21
vengence' (Routledge, 1919:248. See also Fischer, 1997:285).  Fischer (1997), summarises that, 'the 
timo category of inscription recorded the spell against the murderer(s), whereas the  ika category 
listed each ahu’s6 slain victims' (Fischer 1997:286).
Another genre was known as the Ta'u, a list of deeds (Routledge 1919:251-2),  listing the dates and 
number of chickens stolen during the course of a man's life.  These tablets were also known as 
kouhau koro.  An additional tablet was produced, providing an inventory of these koro: recording 
only  the  name  of  the  man,  and  the  year  of  his  koro  (festival).   The  Ta’u genre  of  tablet  in 
combination with its lesser form (koro) may be regarded as an example of 'island historiography' 
equating to a, 'register [of] historical events or names' (Fischer, 1997:289).
There is structural  evidence for the multiple-genre hypothesis,  and for the existence of list-like 
texts.  The inscriptions show regular 'delimiter groups', which Horley (2007a) attributes to lists, 
showing  that  each  tablet  may  be  identified  through  these  delimiter-lists,  allowing  for  further 
segmentation of the texts into smaller fragments.  Horley (2007a) uses statistical methods to reveal 
sequences  of  glyphs  that  were  not  previously  identified  and  demonstrates  that  there  is  a 
correspondence between the number of syllables in the Rapanui language and the number of glyph 
elements appearing between 'delimiter groups' like <380.1.3>, based on a revised sign-list, (Horley, 
2005).  The presence of these repeated glyphs, separating textual-fragments, indicates that we are 
dealing  with  an  important  structural  formation  reflecting  an  inventory  or  list,  (Butinov  and 
Knorozov, 1957:82).    Horley (2007a:27) confirms that, 'from a statistical point of view, structured 
lists  significantly  increase  the  occurrence  of  the  glyphs  belonging  to  their  delimiter  groups'. 
Consequently,  any  comparative  statistical  study  should  take  in  to  account  the,  'corresponding 
Rapanui lists', however legends or songs should be excluded, as they 'feature different patterns and 
vocabulary', supporting the idea of a, 'formulaic requirement' for interpreting some genres of text, 
(Fischer, 1997:283).  
A further clue lies in the “Great Tradition” (or Große Tradition, Barthel, 1958:156), which Horley 
(2007a:27)  attributes  to,  'some kind of a  refrain rather  than a  fixed introductory text'.   Fischer 
(1997) assigns the “Great Tradition”, or procreation chant genre to texts Gv, Ia, and Ta due to their 
similar structural features and the presence of glyph <76> on all three.  Although the genre of the 
tablet  is  still  debated,  previous observations (Barthel,  1958;  Guy,  1985;  1990;  Pozdniakov,  and 
6.  A burial chamber on which moai were erected.
22
Pozdniakov, 1996; 2007; Fischer, 1997; Horley 2005; 2007a; 2009; 2010; Melka, 2009b, 2010) can 
be referred to as a guide for analysis of the inscriptions.  If it is possible to group the tablets into 
their respective genres, a comparative statistical study may be undertaken to discover why glyphs 
are more productive on particular tablets than others.  Consequently, if text-classification methods 
show that previous assumptions on the genre of a tablet are correct, then previous qualitative studies 
will be supported by quantitative methods, where there previously was little or none at all.  This is 
the  domain  of  corpus  linguistics,  lexicostatistics,  and  authorship-attribution  studies,  which  are 
discussed in the methodology section below.
23
Chapter 3 Data
3.1  Data
The rongorongo corpus consists of 25 tablets (there is no consensus on the authenticity of the Poike 
tablet,  see Fischer, 1997:533-534; Melka, 2009a:112).  The  rongorongo corpus is segmented by 
tablet side creating 41 separate texts.  This decision is motivated by previous research showing that 
a selection of tablets are a collection of smaller sub-texts (Metraux, 1940; Butinov and Knorozov, 
1957; Barthel, 1958:151-157; Fischer, 1997; Horley, 2007a:26-30;2010; Melka, 2008, 2009a).  In 
reality, it  is desirable to split each of these 41 texts still  further into even smaller fragments or 
'chunks', however it is not clear where the segments begin and end, or which statistical method will 
help  identify  them,  this  is  therefore  reserved  for  a  future  study (see  further  research  section). 
Further  evidence suggests  that  a  text may continue on to the opposite side of the tablet.   One 
example, (below, figure 3) shows a sequence of glyphs: <59f-2.76-187-[...]-605-2>, appearing on 
the last line of the recto of the Small Santiago tablet (Gr8) and repeated on the first line of the verso 
(Gv1): <59f.76-187-[...]-607.700x.76>, (note slight differences with removal of glyph <2>, see also 
Horley 2010 on Keiti). Therefore, it is acknowledged that this categorisation is still far from ideal.

Table 1. Rongorongo tablet identifier codes (Barthel, 1958; Fischer, 1997:393).
In this study, the Barthel (1958) paradigm is used to reduce the amount of clutter in the multivariate 
graph plots, (results section).  The rongorongo glyphs are transliterated with numeric-codes, 
(Barthel, 1958).  Below is an example, showing the family of glyphs with a 'lozenge' head-shape,

Table 2.  Example transliteration of glyphs classified under glyph-family <200> in the Barthel (1958) sign 
inventory.
Note that each number in the three-digit code reflects the changes in constituents: the first digit is 
assigned to  the head-type,  the middle number to  the body-type,  and the final  digit  reflects  the 
25
change in arm-shape.
Barthel (1958), also uses alphabetic-codes to reflect nuances in the composition or arrangement of 
the glyphs, i.e. variants, subscripts, mirrored or rotated glyphs.  Certain alpha-numeric codes denote 
contracted glyph-forms.  One example, is glyph <3> which may be an alloglyph for alpha-code 'f', 
called 'feathered glyphs' in Barthel's (1958) nomenclature.  As an additional example, glyphs with 
alpha-code 't', like <4t>, are problematic as the only difference between the two types is where the 
scribe has had to fit the glyph in between two others (glyphs highlighted in grey in figure 4, Br1): 
see  glyph  <4>  between  <50.394>  and  <2>,  written  beneath  glyph  <394>  further  on  in  the 
inscription as <4t>.  Therefore glyph <4t> could be considered an instance of the same glyph <4>, 
and may not have a different phonetic or semantic value as a result of subscripting.  Alpha-code 'h' 
is assigned to glyphs, which are squeezed between two glyphs through superscription, for example 
in the Mamari tablet (Ca7): glyph <41h> (highlighted in grey) represents a superscripted 'crescent 
moon' glyph variant of <41> appearing in Ca8.   
In  addition,   as  per  the  evidence  from the  parallel-passages  (tablets  H,  P,  and  Q,  Gr and  K), 
combinations of glyphs, known as ‘suffixed glyphs’ and 'fused glyphs', transliterated with a period 
and colon respectively,  are separated into their  constituent parts.  Therefore,  sequences such as 
<380.1.3> is represented as individual glyphs: <380>, <1>, and <3>.  Guy (1982:447) concludes 
that the reading order for fused glyphs is bottom-to-top due to structural evidence showing fused 
glyphs to be contractions of two or more glyphs that stand independently in other inscriptions.  For 
example, note the contraction of glyph <40> and <211s> to a fused form, where glyph <40> is 
affixed below glyph <211s> as its alloglyph <42> (example Br1, in red).

As a result of the issues with alpha-codes, a number of data-sets were generated with different 
parameters  for pre-processing the corpus to find the best  representation for statistical  purposes.

Table 3.  Summary of the four possible data-sets (prefixed with DD)
Data-set  1 (DD1) and Data-set  2 (DD2) are  abandoned due to  the number of  hapax-legomena 
caused by the preservation of the alpha-codes.  These two data-sets do not consider the similarity 
between glyphs and their contracted or superscripted forms, and will over-inflate tests for lexical-
richness (see below).  Further evidence from Vocabulary Growth Curves (VGC), supports this (see 
section on lexical-richness for more on  VGCs).   Figure 4 shows the empirical  VGC of the four 
derivations of the Barthel (1958) transcriptions, plotted with the  War of the Worlds,  acting as an 
example of a  VGC calculated across a larger sample. The y-axis shows the number of types (V) 
across the sample-size (N), denoted by the x-axis.
27
Figure 5. Empirical Vocabulary growth curve of all data-sets and a comparative sample from War of the worlds.
The curve for the original Barthel (1958) data-set 1 (DD1) shows over 3000 individual types (V) in 
the whole corpus (N) and the curve is not particularly smooth compared to the War of the Worlds 
text, and the sample ends at just over N(10,000).  This is also the case with data-set 2 (DD2) and 
data-set 3 (DD3).  Data-set 4 (DD4) has less types, and is closer to the actual reported sample-size 
of the  rongorongo corpus between  N=14,000 and  N=14,500  tokens, (see Barthel, 1958; Fischer, 
1997; Horley, 2005:108; Melka, 2009a:114).  The best representation therefore comes from DD4, 
which has a smoother curve than the previous data-sets reflecting what we expect from natural 
language (Zipf, 1949), observed with the War of the Worlds sample.  The number of types (V) is also 
more  in  line  with  the  number  of  glyphs,  approximately  632  (Horley,  2005:108),  appearing  in 
Barthel (1958).  The analysis in this paper adopts DD4, with all alpha-codes 'f', replaced by glyph 
<3> (Horley, 2005:111), and by separating fused and affixed glyphs.  It is acknowledged that no 
one-to-one correspondence can be made between glyph and morpheme. This is due to the nature of 
word-frequency distribution and varying sample-size, which cause a shift in position between the 
ranks,  making  a  comparison  meaningless,  (Baayen,  1998;  2001;  Pozdniakov  and  Pozdniakov, 
2007:18).
The language corpora introduced for comparison, is composed of Rapanui language texts collated 
by  Englert  (1970),  Thomson  (1889),  Metraux  (1940),  Felbermayer  (1971),  Campbell  (1971), 
Barthel (1978), and Blixen (1979).  These are collections of native oral tradition, and a possible 
28
authentic rongorongo procreation chant, Atua-mata riri, (Thomson, 1889).  However, some of these 
texts  show  contamination  from  Tahitian,  where  Tahitian  equivalents  of  Rapanui  words  are 
intermingled with the rest of the text (Fischer, 1997:93-95), making them unreliable sources of data. 
In the case of the chant Atua-mata riri, Fischer (1997:96-100) offers a provisional reconstruction to 
compensate for this issue.  
The traditional texts in Barthel (1978), are not very representative of Rapanui oral tradition.  They 
are a collection of traditions from an informant known as Mrs E, and are mainly narrative with 
typographical  and  segmentation  errors.   If  the  tablets  contain  a  variety  of  genres,  then  the 
comparative language corpus needs to reflect this fact with the inclusion of Rapanui songs, chants, 
prayers, poetry.     
The  lack  of  representativeness  of  the  Rapanui  data  is  compensated  for  by including additional 
Polynesian language texts from Maori and Marquesan.  The Maori data is gathered from George 
Grey (1853).  Grey published a large collection of Maori  poems, traditions, chants, and songs. 
Consequently this part of the corpus is much more representative of different genres.  The first 150 
of these texts are selected.  This decision is arbitrary, more texts could be included, and perhaps this 
would even be desirable, however processing-time is a consideration, which runs to several hours 
with large corpora. Furthermore, a random-sampling approach is chosen due to the other corpora 
having been subjected to the same mode of selection.  
The Marquesan texts form a collection of chants and love songs recorded by Elbert (1941:61-91). 
Within the Eastern Polynesian language group, Rapanui is closest to Marquesan morphologically, 
whereas its phonology has more in common with New Zealand Maori.  Many Polynesian languages 
share  the  same  syntax  particles,  some  with  slight  phonemic  changes;  for  example  the 
causative: /haka-/ (Rapanui), and /Whaka-/ (Maori); the +specific determiner /te/; possessive /o/ and 
/a/; tense marker /i/.  Phonological differences include Marquesan (i.e. the switching of [k] to the 
glottal  stop  in  North  and  South  Marquesan,  respectively,  for  example:  /koe/  –  North 
Marquesan, /`oe/ – South Marquesan, the second person singular.  See Elbert, 1941:58; 1982:502), 
but all three languages show the same patterns of use, confirmed by KWIC concordances:

Table 4. Grammatical structures present in Maori, Marquesan, and Rapanui
Metraux (1940:419) believes that the three cultures are linked by a shared heritage of cultural traits 
each related to a particular area of expertise, for example the building of Ahu's (burial chambers); a 
part of Rapanui and Marquesan tradition.  In addition, Marquesan and Rapanui cultures practice the 
carving of stone statues, whereas the Maori carved in wood, which is perhaps attributable to the 
type and abundance of certain materials.
Another motivation for selecting Maori is due to their ancient origin; in a footnote to the text He 
tangi, mo mokowera, i mate ia ki wharekura, kei ohiwa, Grey notes: 
[…]  it  is  the  custom of  the  natives  to  compose  their  poetry  
rather by combining materials drawn from ancient poems, than 
by inventing original matter. An apparently recent poem is thus  
sometimes really of very ancient origin. 
Grey (1853:14)
Grey's  texts  are  important  as  they  pre-date  many  of  the  collections  made  by  rongorongo 
investigators (Barthel, 1978; Jaussen, 1893b; Thomson, 1889; Routledge, 1919; Metraux, 1940). If 
any of these texts have 'ancient origins', an assumption that could be made is that there exists a set 
of  formulaic  expressions  shared  among  Polynesian  orators,  which  may  be  present  in  the 
rongorongo inscriptions.  
The Maori texts, 150 in total, were categorised into literary genre according to the genre designated 
in their titles.  For example,  He  waiata  meaning 'song',  He tangi – 'lament',  He tau – 'recitation 
30
before speaking', He karakia – 'incantation', He whakaaraara – 'War chant'.  Texts that could not be 
categorised were labelled 'prose'.  It is acknowledged that this is not the most accurate form of 
classification.
3.2  Pre-processing
The rongorongo glyphs are divided into units according to a hyphen between glyphs, along the lines 
of  Pozdniakov  and  Pozdniakov  (2007:14).  Each  glyph  is  assumed  to  be  representative  of  a 
morpheme in the Rapanui language in line with Pozdniakov and Pozdniakov (2007) and Horley 
(2005; 2007).  The language corpus was trialled in a pilot study7, and it became apparent that there 
are a wealth of compound forms.  These distort the frequency-counts and KWIC concordances; 
reducing the number of actual types in the corpus (see for example, the forms used in interrogative 
Q-constructions, appearing in De Feu, 1996:19-21).  As an example, the possessive particle system 
is particularly complex.

5.  ta'ana  te-a-ia  Specifier - possessive alienable - 2nd Person singular
6.  to'ona  te-o-ia  Specifier - possessive inalienable - 2nd Person singular
Table 5. Compound morphemes in the Rapanui corpus
The final syllable of the possessive is a substituted form of the personal pronouns for 1st, 2nd, and 3rd 
persons, with /-ku/ representing /au/ (1st), /-u/ for /koe/ (2nd), and /-na/ for /ia/ (3rd).  The above 
paradigm represents the singular forms, and the plural is derived through elision of the initial /t/ of 
the specifier.  This is a small sample of the possessive system and there are many more, including 
inclusive  and  exclusive  versions  (see  De  Feu,  1996:144-145;  Karena-Holmes,  1997:50).   The 
question is whether these possessive forms should be divided up in the corpus.  This paper adopts 
the surface-structure, and reserves further segmentation for a future study.
Although an error free dataset has been one of the primary aims, it has not always been possible due 
7.  Pilot study results presented at the Bloomsbury Conference in Applied Linguistics (2009)
31
to the nature of working with corpora from varying languages, sources, transliterations (for example 
in  vowel  length:  taana  versus  tana  -  3rd person possessive  singular,  Tregear,  1891:460).   The 
language  corpora  are  primarily  pre-processed  through  removal  of  all  punctuation,  as  this  is  a 
Western orthographic convention. There are also differences in transcription, for example, in the 
Rapanui texts we see entries for /kiroto ki/ and /iroto i/, these are divided into /ki roto ki/ and /i roto 
i/8, respectively.  The pre-processing stage was performed with software written for this study and 
manual  corrections  were  kept  to  a  minimum,  in  order  to  avoid  errors  associated  with  manual 
processing.
The language corpus provides a good environment for future investigation of linguistic structures, 
and literary-genre in Polynesian languages.  This is especially true here as there does not appear to 
be a recognised Polynesian corpus in existence, compared to those like the Brown corpus available 
for English-based studies.  
8.  The morpheme /roto/ is a separate word meaning 'inside' or 'within', and forms part of a complex preposition, here denoted by /ki/ 
and /i/, which are particles, (see Tregear, 1891: 428), and the Austronesian Basic vocabulary Database word no.174, (Greenhill et al., 
2008).

Chapter 4 Methodology
4.1 Corpus linguistics
Many of the principles and methods adopted in this  analysis  are founded on corpus linguistics 
(Biber et al., 1998; Gries, 2009), lexicostatistics (Baayen, 2001; 2008; Baroni, 2006; 2009; Evert 
and Baroni, 2005; 2006; 2007), authorship-attribution studies (Mosteller and Wallace, 1964; Baayen 
et al., 1996; 2002; Stamatatos, 2000; 2009; Peng et al., 2002; 2003), and information retrieval, (see 
in particular Landauer et al., 2004; Manning et al., 2008).
As stated by Pozdniakov and Pozdniakov (2007:4), ‘the appearance of yet another monograph with 
a new ‘translation’ of the corpus of texts would be significantly less interesting than the appearance 
of an article presenting the results of a structural analysis of some specific aspect of the writing 
system’.  In light of this statement, great emphasis on statistics to support any generalisations about 
the script’s composition is the main guiding principle for this study.  
Melka  (2009a)  is  the  first  to  mention  corpus  linguistics  as  a  method  for  the  decipherment  of 
rongorongo, although, in his view, 'the solution to what exactly rongorongo is will not be scheduled 
or delivered via a corpus linguistic methodology', although, 'the approach will take us closer to its 
'understanding'', (Melka, 2009a:112).  
The first decision to be made is the unit of analysis, which determines not only the falsifiability of 
the final results, but also the initial steps needed to collate and process the corpus.  Corpus studies 
are largely based on two forms of analysis, either 'describing a linguistic structure', or a 'group of 
texts (Biber et al., 1998:273). These are termed the 'observations' of the study with each observation 
being an occurrence of the feature to be studied.  The unit of analysis, adopted in this study, is a 
single glyph or morpheme. However, when applying authorship-attribution methods, each text is 
considered to be an observation, (Biber et al.,  1998:269).  One notable study of this kind is by 
Mosteller  and Wallace (1964) who investigate the disputed authorship of the Federalist  papers, 
through an analysis of each text showing how they can be attributed to the most likely author.  
Melka (2009a) highlights the problematic nature of the  rongorongo corpus itself:   an issue that 
causes  a  'number  of  problems  for  the  investigation'  (Melka,  2009a:114),  is  the  destruction, 
misplacement,  and  sale  of  many tablets  by the  turn  of  the  nineteenth  century.   This  makes  it 
33
impossible to consider the corpus to be representative of the entire wealth of possible literary genres 
that  formed the  rongorongo tradition.   History has  only handed down a  few tablets  for  study, 
however there is still enough material9 for a statistical analysis of the mechanisms underlying the 
rongorongo script.  A mixed-methods and interdisciplinary approach is predicted to be the most 
successful for exploring the  rongorongo script, as the best parts of each method can be adopted, 
whilst abandoning their individual shortcomings, (Dörnyei, 2007). 
The corpus of twenty-five tablets is not of the magnitude normally associated with corpus linguistic 
studies,  compared  the  Brown Corpus  of  English,  totalling  a  million  words.   However,   Melka 
(2009a:113) states that current rongorongo research 'should consider the approach of a text-oriented 
analysis as essential in order to be able to establish safer parameters'.  In light of this statement, a 
corpus-based approach is adopted in this paper.  
Biber  (et  al.,  1998:249) propose that  1000 word samples are sufficient  for reliable  counts of a 
linguistic feature in a text.  However, in lexicographic studies this sample would need to be much 
larger, totalling millions of words, due to the fact that many words occur with a very low frequency, 
perhaps only once, known as the  hapax-legomena,  which are a very important focus for word-
frequency-distribution studies, see Baayen (2001), but we also need to know which glyphs and 
morphemes are the most productive to begin identifying possible syntax markers.  According to 
Biber (et al., 1998) if a corpus contains too few texts, 'a single text can have an undue influence on 
the results of the analysis', (Biber et al., 1998:248-249).  This issue is attributable to a particular 
kind of study, i.e. a study into dialectal differences, or studies into language and gender.  Therefore, 
as  long  as  the  nature  of  the  texts  used  in  a  corpus  are  made  explicit,  and  the  methods  and 
assumptions are transparent, then any imbalance in the corpus will be clear.  
Representativeness is an additional consideration in corpus linguistics (Summers, 1993; Biber et al., 
1998; Melka, 2009a).  The term 'representativeness' is understood to mean: 
[…] covering  what  we  judge  to  be  the  typical  and  central  
aspects of the language, and providing enough occurrences of  
words  and  phrases  […] to  make  accurate  statements  about 
lexical behaviour. 
Summers (1993:186-187)
9.  Although rongorongo does not exhibit the wealth of inscriptions compared to Linear B (more than 3000, see Robinson, 2002:84), 
compared to the Phaistos disc (one artefact, see Fischer, 1997a; Robinson, 2002:298), or the 3700 short inscriptions of the Indus 
Valley seals (Robinson, 2002:268), sizeable sections of continuous texts can be extracted for statistical scrutiny. 
34
Biber  (et  al.,  1998:248)  observes  that,  'there  are  important  differences  in  the  use  of  lexical, 
grammatical, and discourse features across varieties of language'.  If the rongorongo corpus is  not 
considered to be representative of the diversity of literary genres, a comparable corpus that does 
contain  a  variety of  text-genres  is  necessary,  in  order  to  offset  any imbalance.   This  is  where 
multilingual  corpora  are  useful  for  comparing  grammatical  structures  and  word-frequency  to 
identify parallels between rongorongo and Rapanui, Marquesan, or Maori.  In this study, we must 
consider the corpus of  rongorongo texts to be a random-sample, and consequently not all literary 
genres are likely to be represented, (Melka, 2009a).  
It should also be kept in mind that any corpus-based study will never be truly representative of the 
whole population, as this population is either very large, difficult to sample, or continuously being 
expanded, so although we could say, for example, that we have collated all texts produced by Noam 
Chomsky, there is no reason to assume he will not publish another book in the future.  Therefore, as 
long  as  the  corpus  is  representative  of  the  unit(s)  under  investigation,  and  its  limitations  are 
recognised, the study can still provide valuable insights under these principles.  Therefore this paper 
views the rongorongo corpus as a random sample of those tablets that may have existed as part of a 
wider collection of inscriptions, with the unit of analysis being a single glyph or morpheme.
Due to the multilingual nature of the corpora, and differing transliteration schemes, off-the-shelf 
software is not sufficient.  Although Freeware and commercially available software could perform 
sufficiently, the need to edit the data according to the requirements of the software are unattractive 
due to the size and complexities of the rongorongo corpus.  In addition, many applications are not 
equipped  to  deal  with  multilingual  data  or  numeric  transliteration  systems.   The  R statistical 
programming  language  is  selected  as  the  best  approach  due  to  it  being  freely  available,  very 
flexible, powerful, and fast (see http://cran.r-project.org/).  The R environment makes it possible to 
process all the corpora procedurally with little intervention from the user aside from validating the 
results.   Ultimately this  means  that  the problems outlined above,  with respect  to  transliteration 
schemes, is overcome by writing programs specific to each corpus ensuring that the same analysis is 
applied consistently throughout.  
In corpus linguistics, words are known as tokens, in fact,  punctuation and white space are also 
considered  as  tokens  in  some  authorship-attribution  studies  (see  Baayen  et  al.,  2002).   Word-
frequency  forms  a  large  part  of  corpus-based  investigations,  for  example  in  lexicostatistics, 
historical  linguistics,  and  Natural  Language Processing  (NLP),  which  study the  productivity  of 
35
words and lexical-association patterns to discover how language changes over time, by its speakers, 
and in different contexts, (see Biber et al., 1998).
Although informative, generalisations can not be made purely on word counts.  Due to the varying 
nature of language, the productivity of a word may vary depending on context, speaker/writer, and 
more importantly the size of the sample.  Therefore, even if word counts are nominalised (Biber et 
al., 1998:263-264), the counts would still not reflect the true population from which the sample 
came.  Relative frequency counts add up to 100%, which does not allow any space for unseen types. 
This means that there are still words in the population which have not yet appeared, but are likely to 
if we increase the sample size.  Recent lexicostatistic studies (Baayen, 2001), have sought after a 
method to compensate for this issue. Baayen (2001:5) defines this problem as  LNRE,  or  Large 
Number of Rare Events.  This idea refers to the fact that word-distributions contain a large number 
of low-probability words, represented by the  hapax-,  dis-, and  tri-legomena, or words occurring 
only once, twice, or three times. 
Another issue with word-frequency counts is that a comparison based on different sample-sizes, are 
not accurate as the sample mean increases as a function of sample-size, (Baayen, 2001:4-5; Evert 
and Baroni, 2006).  In addition, median and mode are usually uninformative due to their value 
generally  being  between  1  and  3,  because  of  the  previously  mentioned  abundance  of  low-
probability words.  There are a number of options available to address these fundamental issues. 
Firstly, we may take a set number of tokens and form a sub-corpora of each text, for example, the 
first 1000 glyphs in each text.  This would allow a comparison, but with a certain amount of data-
loss.  For this study, this results in a considerable loss of data, to what is already a relatively small 
corpus by comparison.
In order to address this issue, a word-frequency model can be generated first.  An important law in 
lexicostatistics is Zipfs law (1949), (see also Baayen, 2001; Baroni, 2006).  Application of Zipf’s 
law  involves  organising  the  frequencies  according  to  decreasing  value  in  rank-order,  with  the 
highest-frequency being assigned rank 1.  We can now compensate for the issues corresponding to 
relative-frequency counts through prediction of the unseen types.  The ranking does not consider 
which word is at  each rank, for example, whether the word  and is the most frequent,  but does 
enable us to model word-distributions and analyse vocabulary-growth and lexical-richness.
  
A language model is generated to extrapolate a small sample text to a larger sample-size whilst 
accounting for the LNRE, by freeing up the probability-space for new word-types.  As observed by 
36
Evert and Baroni (2006:1), 'in order to compare samples of different sizes […] it is thus necessary 
to extrapolate their observed values to much larger samples'.  
Zipf’s  law  predicts  that  word-distributions  follow  a  straight-line  in  double-logarithmic  space. 
According to Baayen (2001:32), ‘many statistical tests pre-suppose normality’, in other words the 
well  recognised  ‘bell-shape’ of  the  normal  distribution,  where  the  mean  centres  around  zero, 
however,  as  seen  by  the  plot  below  (figure  5)  word-distributions  do  not  follow  a  normal 
distribution:  
Figure 6. Zipf Frequency/Rank plots for ‘Alice in Wonderland’.
Note the long tail stretching along the bottom-right of the plot.  This represents the hapax-legomena 
and consequently the lexical-richness of the text.  In terms of Zipfs double-logarithmic space, it is 
possible to make the above distributions more 'normal' by transforming the absolute frequency of 
each word to ‘log frequency’ (Baayen, 2001:32), reflected in figure  7.   
37

logarithmic space.
In figure 7, the straight line in double-logarithmic space, predicted by Zipf (1949), does not hold for 
the  text  'Huckleberry  Finn'  nor  for  ‘Alice  in  Wonderland',  though  it  accounts  for  the  middle-
frequencies fairly well.  Therefore,  Zipf's law fails to account for the top and bottom frequencies, 
which curve downwards from their predicted values.  As a result,  Zipf's law does not predict the 
correct distribution of the hapax-legomena and the most frequent words occupying the bottom and 
top-ranks, respectively.  Tests of lexical-richness would also be unreliable due to the difference in 
sample-size:  Huckleberry  Finn  at  116,608 tokens,  and  Alice  in  Wonderland  consists  of  29,951 
tokens.  
Texts  can  also  be  divided  into  equal-sized  'chunks',  (Mosteller  and  Wallace,  1964;  Peng  and 
Hengartner, 2002), or as per Baayen (2001), and Evert and Baroni (2006), a model of the word-
distributions can be implemented by selecting an appropriate model and experimenting with the 
parameters until a good fit of the word-distributions is achieved.  These models form the basis for 
interpolating and extrapolating data to the required sample-size.  Baayen (2001), recommends that 
sample-size is not extrapolated to more than twice the original size, due to potential inaccuracies in 
38
the predictions made by the model.  This issue may be addressed by sampling only part of the 
population.   However,  as  stated  by  Evert  and  Baroni,  (2005:5),  'extrapolation  quality  rapidly 
degrades when less than 25% of the data are used for estimation', still, with only 25% it is possible 
to extrapolate up to four times the original sample-size (Evert and Baroni, 2005:2).  In addition, 
they believe that a large part of the issues related to extrapolation can be attributed to the 'non-
randomness of the corpus data', (Evert and Baroni, 2005:14), although they admit that the  non-
randomness of word-distributions can not be the sole cause of some poor estimates (Evert  and 
Baroni, 2005:15).
Evert  and Baroni  (2006)  developed the  ZipfR package for  R,  which calculates  Zipf-like  LNRE 
models  such  as  the  Zipf-Mandelbrot (ZM),  finite  Zipf-Mandelbrot (fZM),  and  the  Generalised 
Inverse Gauss Poisson (GIGP) model.  The  Zipf-Mandelbrot model is similar  to Zipf's original 
model,  with  two additional  parameters:  a to  modify  the  slope  of  the  rank-frequency graph in 
double-logarithmic space, and b to adjust the downward curvature of the line – accounting for the 
mismatch between the straight-line predicted by Zipf (1949) in figure 7, and the actual curve of the 
rank-frequency distribution,  (see  Baayen,  2001:101-102).  The  finite  or  non-finite  distinction  is 
where the model assumes that the number of words in the distribution are potentially infinite (or 
finite respectively), which influences the final predictions. The  fZM and  GIGP models generally 
provide 'the best results', (Evert and Baroni, 2005:17), as will be seen in the results section.  
Before describing how these models are generated, the notation used to describe the features of the 
model is explained, (see Baayen, 2001; 2008:231).  Sample-size is denoted by N, with the number 
of types in the sample (N) expressed as V(N).  In terms of Zipf's law, let m represent the rank of a 
particular  frequency  type,  expressed  as  Vm(N),  that  is,  the  number  of  individual  types  with 
frequency m in a sample of N tokens.
The models are based on two types of data.  Firstly, the frequency spectrum, Vm(N), is a ‘table of 
frequencies with frequencies’ (Baayen, 2008:230).  For example, the frequency spectrum of Alice in  
Wonderland shows there are 858 words with the lowest frequency, 295 for the second least frequent 
word, and 152 words that are third least frequent.  The second data-type is the vocabulary growth 
rate, which is the, ‘joint probability of the unseen types’ (Baayen, 2009:229).  The data are used to 
predict how the frequency of a word changes as a function of an increase in the size of the sample.
In order to address the issue of words having non-random distributions, Baayen (2001:64-69) and 
39
Evert and Baroni (2006:8) propose a technique called bi-nominal interpolation.  This resolves the 
non-random distribution of words (a problem for extrapolation quality), by performing a series of 
computational  calculations,  which  randomly order  the  words.  Bi-nominal  interpolation  takes  a 
frequency spectrum of the words, and calculates the expected vocabulary size E(Vm), and the count 
for each frequency rank.  This means that vocabulary growth can be calculated for any sample-size, 
as long as it is equal to or less than the size of the sample that the frequency spectrum was originally 
generated from.  By applying these models to the rongorongo and language corpora, we can select 
the texts with the biggest sample-size and interpolate them to values comparable to the smaller 
sample texts, or extrapolate the smaller texts to the text with the largest sample-size.  This permits  a 
comparison between texts, but it is still necessary to exclude some texts from the analysis, such as: 
the Honolulu tablets (3622, 3623 and 445), the New York Birdman (X), the Paris snuffbox (Y), and 
the Poike (Z) tablet; and language texts with less than 50 words.  This is because it is not possible to 
model the vocabulary growth of a text with hardly any data available for the model to base its 
calculations on.   
4.1.1  N-gram: Uni-gram, bi-grams, and tri-grams
N-gram refers to a  n number of morphemes or words.  Frequency counts of n-grams are used as 
data for a frequency spectrum analysis.  The 100 most frequent glyphs and morphemes are selected 
for further scrutiny using additional statistical techniques (described below), specifically as features 
for PCA and factor analysis.  
A bi-gram  may  represent  a  collocation  and  provides  the  basis  for  investigating  larger  stable 
sequences in the arrangement of linguistic or orthographic elements.  Bi-grams may also denote 
sequences of [noun + prepositional phrase], for example in [school of fish], or [verb + preposition]; 
as seen in [went to town].  Tri-grams are also important as they capture larger sequences or reveal 
more  information  in  terms  of  what  morpheme  is  present  after  a  collocation,  whether  it  is  a 
preposition,  another  noun,  or  the  verb.   However,  one  caveat  to  analysing  bi-grams,  and  in 
particular tri-grams, is the data-sparseness issue.  By dividing the corpus into these constituent parts 
there is a reduction in the amount of data that can be analysed, as more  hapax-, dis-,  and  tris-
legomena are generated. 
40
4.1.2  Key Word In Context concordances (KWIC)
Key Words In Context concordances (or KWIC, see Biber et al., 1998:26-28), is another method in 
corpus linguistics used to identify stable linguistic sequences such as those that can be extracted 
with bi-gram and tri-gram data. The idea behind this method is to analyse a particular lexical unit 
within the context that it appears.  This method is used in dictionary compilation and production of 
second language education literature.  A KWIC listing provides all the contexts for a given word. 
The lexical unit under investigation is called the node, and appears in the centre; tokens before and 
after the node can be extracted to see which words form ‘collocates’ (Biber et al., 1998:36), or set-
phrases. KWIC data can often locate regular patterns of usage or lexical-association patterns (see 
Biber et al., 1998), and the analysis does not need to be restricted to neighbouring words, but may 
also include words appearing two or three places from the node, reflecting grammatical-association 
patterns (see Biber et al., 1998).
This method may reveal possible collocations in the rongorongo corpus or identify a grammatical 
structure or pattern that may not be discovered by palaeographic methods.  Combining all the texts 
in the corpus into one text file makes it more apparent which patterns are productive on more than 
one text, and by how much.  This allows the data to be filtered for those key structures that appear 
with a high frequency, and in which structural context they appear.  This is particularly useful for 
disambiguating  homophones  such  as  a  number  of  grammatical  particles  found  in  Polynesian 
languages: the particle /i/,  in Maori for example, has around seven different uses, including as a 
tense marker, and a dative. Another instance, is the particle /te/,  which may appear in either the 
nominal  or  verbal  frame  (DeFeu,  1996).   Consequently,  KWIC  lists  allow  us  to  explore  and 
understand the structure of the corpus. 
4.2  Authorship-attribution methods 
Authorship-attribution defines a group of methods used to identify the literary-genre or author of a 
text. In short, a 'special form of text classification in which the classes are essentially just the works 
of given authors' (Mosteller and Wallace, 1964:xvii). A significant body of research based on the 
use of statistical and computational methods was brought about by Mosteller and Wallace (1964) 
and have since been expanded in modern studies to include more advanced quantitative methods, 
such as machine learning, neural networks, and plagiarism detection.  Research shows that different 
literary genres can be determined by underlying grammatical  structures,  including,  collocations, 
41
function words, and phrases; just some of the indicators used to identify the stylistic 'finger print' of 
a particular author (Baayen, 2002).  
As noted  previously,  relative  frequencies  of  glyphs  in  the  rongorongo corpus  will  not  provide 
sufficient statistical evidence to support any generalisations.  Therefore, other methods have been 
sought that will support and contextualise the frequency data, in the form of  meta-data recording 
the  source,  year,  context,  and  register  of  a  text.   Much  of  this  information  is  missing  in  the 
rongorongo corpus and we do not know which tablet represents which genre of text.  Authorship-
attribution studies  provide a  set  of  methods that  are  non-parametric  and capable  of  processing 
multivariate data, and highlighting categories or clusters in the data.  
The first issue to address in authorship-attribution studies are the selection of features that, ‘most 
accurately summarise an author’s style’, (Peng and Hengartner, 2002:175).  Mosteller and Wallace 
(1964) discovered that function words were more successful as discriminators of authorship as they 
are context independent, unlike content words (see Mosteller and Wallace, 1964:17-39).  This is 
supported by Peng and Hengartner’s study which shows that function words are the most successful 
in  discriminating  between  texts,  because  they  show high  variability  and  frequency,  (Peng  and 
Hengartner, 2002:184).  
Peng et al., (2003) uses character-level n-grams.  This involves removing all white space in the 
corpus, which reduces the data to one long block of text.  This is then divided into single characters 
(letters) and frequencies are generated.  Peng (et al., 2003) shows that by using groups of three 
characters as features, the classification of their Greek data-set is improved by 18% compared to 
previous  studies  (Stamatatos  et  al.,  1999;  2000;  2001).   In  addition,  the  methods  are  language 
independent, which is demonstrated through a parallel analysis of Chinese and English data, (Peng, 
2003:6).
Holmes  (1992)  uses  multivariate  analysis  including  principal  component  analysis,  and tests  for 
lexical-richness to assess whether Mormon texts are attributable to more than one author. Whereas a 
study by Tomatsu (2006) investigates the literary motifs adopted by Japanese authors in order to 
identify three of the most traditional authors of Japanese prose.  This is achieved through analysis of 
word-frequency, and length, but also investigating each authors’ use of  hiragana,  katakana, and 
kanji, (Tomatsu, 2006:5).     
42
It  is  possible  to  use  the  unit  of  analysis  proposed  by  Peng  (et  al.,  2003);  as  Horley  (2005), 
demonstrates that we can further subdivide the main glyphs into smaller units, which may represent 
syllables.  Although this  is  not the unit  of analysis  adopted by this  study,  it  would no doubt be 
interesting to compare the results from this corpus with the others to see if a smaller unit of analysis 
performs better as concluded by Peng (et al., 2003).  This will be the focus of a future study.  
Lexical-studies demonstrate that the top-frequencies in corpora are generally occupied by ‘function 
words’ and the lower frequencies tend to be the domain of ‘content words’, (Baroni, 2006:5). In this 
study,  word-frequency  data  is  filtered  for  the  hundred  most  productive  function  words  in  the 
language, and glyph corpora acting as the feature set. This is an arbitrary figure, but in accordance 
with  previous  research  by  Mosteller  and  Wallace  (1964:28),  and  Pozdniakov  and  Pozdniakov 
(2007).  
Despite not knowing what the set of a hundred glyphs consists of in terms of 'functional' units, it is 
reasonable to assume that the most frequent glyphs have some structural significance in their usage. 
The Santiago staff (Ia) is often excluded from statistical analysis because of the high occurrence of 
the 'phallus' (glyph <76>) and because the large size of the text causes glyph <76> to appear in the 
top rank in the whole corpus of rongorongo texts.  In other texts, sequence <380.1> dominates the 
frequency ranks.  This is a good thing for this study, which looks for variability between texts, as 
these glyphs appear to be attributable to certain tablets or small sections of tablets, which make 
them good candidates as discriminators of rongorongo literary genre.  
To summarise, this study uses the texts and their n-grams of whole morphemes or glyphs as the unit 
of analysis for authorship-attribution methods.  The term ‘genre’, when applied to the language 
corpora, is used in its traditional sense; i.e. to refer to a specific literary-style.  However, when 
referring to the groupings of the  rongorongo tablets, it is used as a convenient label to describe 
these groupings, but without implying a specific genre.   
Authorship-attribution  methods  will  identify  the  elements  that  categorise  the  tablets  into  their 
respective  groups,  extracted  through:  word-frequency,  lexical-richness,  principal  components 
analysis  (PCA),  factor  analysis,  and  latent  semantic  analysis  (LSA);  commonly  adopted  in 
information-retrieval studies, forensic linguistics, and psycholinguistics.
43
4.2.1  Principal components analysis
Principal components analysis (PCA) is part of a series of methods involving the analysis of more 
than one variable (termed multivariate analysis).  PCA applies advanced statistical methods in order 
to reduce the number of variables, particularly if they offer little discriminatory value.  One of the 
most attractive aspects of PCA is its non-parametric nature, which is beneficial as it removes part of 
the subjective nature of choosing the factors that best define multivariate data-sets.
PCA, takes a matrix of data and tries to reduce the number of dimensions necessary for identifying 
the position of the data-points, (Baayen 2008).  If this process was visualised in three-dimensional 
space, a cube would contain all of these data-points as coordinates.  This cube can be rotated using 
varimax or promax rotation10 (Baayen, 2008), providing a new view of the data, until an interesting 
structure is identified.  This is achieved through, 'rotating the axes in such a way that you get two 
new axes in the diagonal plane of the original, unrotated axes' (Baayen 2008:120).  Once the cube is 
optimally positioned, the principal components (PCs) that capture the most variance, are extracted. 
So PC1 contains the points explaining the majority of the variation, with subsequent PCs explaining 
less and less.  When plotted in a scree plot, the most important  PCs are easily recognisable, (see 
results  below).   The rotation-matrix contains the values (loadings) needed to plot the data in a 
scatter-plot,  (see Baayen, 2008:124).  These loadings are proportionate to the correlation of the 
word or glyph frequency-counts. In this way the scatter-plot reveals interesting structures or clusters 
in the data. 
Baayen  (et  al.,  2002),  discovered  that  in  a  strictly  controlled  experiment  involving  groups  of 
authors, with very similar backgrounds and training, there exists an authorial 'finger print' or style. 
They note  that  a  principal  components  analysis  of  the  most  frequent  function  words  does  not 
provide  any  insight  into  authorial  structure  where  controls  are  in  place,  but  other  principal 
component studies (Baayen, 1996) where the authors have very different backgrounds, training, or 
span different  time periods,  are more successful at  being categorised with principal  component 
analysis,  (Baayen et  al.,  2002:6).   Since the  rongorongo tablets were likely carved by different 
scribes (Routledge, 1919), then this method may be successful.   
The results of the PCA (below) are based on the methods proposed by Baayen (2008) in a study of 
10.  Promax rotation tends to provide the better fit, as it allows the factors to be correlated.  Varimax rotation assumes that there is no 
correlation between factors, and is applied when the primary aim is on the generalisability of the findings (see Baayen, 2008:127).
44
'affix productivity' from Baayen (1994).  Here Baayen (2008) investigates 'the extent to which the 
productivity of an affix is co-determined by stylistic factors' (Baayen 2008:118).  Baayen's analysis 
is based on a matrix of n-gram counts; the frequency counts of 27 derivational affixes, over 44 texts 
with different genres.  Baayen's results show that the productivity of the affix can be used as a 
means to group texts according to genre.  In addition, PCA makes it possible to reduce the number 
of  dimensions  from 27 to  only 3,  without  losing too much of  the structure in  the data,  whilst 
accounting for 76.6% of the variance in the data, (Baayen, 2008:122).        
    
In conclusion, PCA is a data-reduction method allowing an informed choice on which dimensions 
are important for explaining the underlying structure of a large multivariate data-set.  This paper 
applies principal components analysis to evaluate the available data-sets (DD1-DD4) to identify the 
potential for analysing  rongorongo  literary-genre.  The analysis assesses the extent to which the 
rongorongo texts exhibit any form of clustering or clearly defined groups.  The data-set used by 
PCA is based on the results from the frequency-count data.  The 100 most productive glyphs, and 
morphemes, are chosen as the feature-set (or dimensions).  The assumption is that these features 
capture the most productive grammatical particles in the Polynesian language, and rongorongo data. 
Of course,  it  is  not expected that a  one-to-one correspondence will  be found.  In other  words, 
despite glyph <1> being the most productive in certain texts, it does not necessarily entail that it 
relates to the most frequent word in the Rapanui language data: the definite article /te/.  The highest 
occurring glyphs in the rongorongo corpus may be ‘functional units’ of a kind, but they would be 
restricted to the writing system, due to the disparity between language and writing.  Whether this is 
the case or not, it can be assumed that the top-ranking glyph-frequencies represent those glyphs that 
have a functional or syntactic role in the script.
A matrix of glyph-frequencies for each text is used as the feature-set, which is selected according to 
the criteria  adopted by Mosteller  and Wallace's  (1964:45).   They recommend that  the,  'pool  of 
potential discriminators should be large enough, say, 50 to 1000, to offer a good chance of success'. 
In addition, Pozdniakov and Pozdniakov (2007:12) consider the 100 most productive glyphs to be 
appropriate for their statistical analysis.  This paper therefore adopts the same principle. 
45
4.2.2  Factor analysis
Factor analysis is used to, 'examine how underlying constructs influence the responses on a number 
of measured variables' (DeCoster, 1998:1).  Factor analysis is another multivariate technique that 
identifies structures in large data-sets, and is an extension of PCA.   It differs in that an error term is 
applied to the model to account for the presence of possible noise in the data, (Baayen, 2008:127). 
The factor analysis requires a matrix of counts, which in this study, is composed of the features used 
in the PCA.  
Columns represent glyphs, or morphemes, and the counts across the corpus of texts (in rows).  A 
technique called factor rotation is the applied to this matrix, providing a simpler interpretation of the 
data.  This method is more successful where there are high loadings on a few factors (Baayen, 
2008:127).   The  data-points  can  also  be  rotated  through  varimax or  promax  rotation  methods. 
Promax  rotation  involves  rotating the loadings  through a  general  linear  transformation of  each 
factor in order to get a better idea of the underlying structure, whilst preserving the variance of the 
factors.  This will therefore provide a better view of the separation between texts.  For the purposes 
of this study two factor analyses (one varimax-based and one promax-based) are produced in order 
to demonstrate the difference.  
In this study three factors are chosen, as less than three factors provides hardly any separation in the 
data, and too many cause the points to be too dispersed.  The results of the PCA provides some clue 
as to how many factors should be selected based on the number of significant principal components 
(PC), which are identified by a scree-plot (see the results section, below).
4.2.3  Tests of lexical-richness
Data from vocabulary growth curves (VGC) and frequency-spectra provide the basis for a model of 
lexical-richness.  Relative frequency counts are susceptible to the issues associated with sample-
size, and LNRE (see Baayen, 2001). VGCs make it possible to adjust the sample-size of each text. 
This  involves  interpolating  the  samples,  for  smoothing,  and then  extrapolating  the  interpolated 
curve to the size of the largest text, through a LNRE model (Baayen, 2001): for example, the Finite  
Zipf-Mandelbrot model (fZM), or the Generalised Inverse Gauss Poisson model (GIGP), illustrated 
by Baroni (2006; 2007; 2009).   Once an accurate goodness-of-fit is achieved, the model provides 
the basis for text comparison with Baayen’s P, (Baayen, 2001).  Baayen’s P is equal to the number 
46
of hapax-legomena divided by the number of types in the sample (V1/Vm).  High values will show 
that a text is lexically-rich.  For example, as many of the hapax-legomena are likely to be content 
words, many of these may be nouns denoting names of people, places, or things.  As a result, it is 
expected that a genealogical text should be particularly rich in content-words as they reference 
names of people, events, and dates, compared to a prose or narrative text.  
4.2.4  Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA)
Another method adopted is latent semantic analysis (LSA), which is based on a, 'representation that 
captures the similarity of words and  text passages', known as a ‘semantic space’, (Landauer and 
Dumais, 1997:211).  LSA works by representing the words used in a corpus of texts, from the size of 
a whole essay, or even just key words appearing as a title in a document (Foltz et al., 1998:4).  LSA 
applied  to  information-retrieval  is  shown to  increase  accuracy by up  to  30% (Dumais,  1991), 
despite differences in language use.  Wolfe et al., (1998:1) determine whether the acquisition of 
knowledge is dependent on knowledge already acquired, and how the complexity of a text has an 
impact on acquisition.  They apply LSA to the problem of knowledge induction, by examining the 
entries listed in an encyclopaedia on the 'human heart', and comparing the results to a student-based 
survey  on  the  same  subject.   LSA has  found  applications  in  modelling  language  acquisition 
(Landauer  and  Dumais,  1997),  word-disambiguation  (Pino  and  Eskenazi,  2009),  plagiarism 
detection, and computational biology, applied to protein sequencing (Dong et al., 2006). 
LSA is particularly relevant for the study of rongorongo, as it provides an insight into how glyphs 
are used by calculating the, 'approximate estimates of the contextual usage substitutability of words 
in larger text segments', (Foltz et al., 1998:3).  Applying a LSA to the glyphs (see below), retrieves 
lexical-association patterns (Biber et al., 1998), and the degree of correlation between the individual 
lexical-components.  Although the analysis of bi-grams and tri-grams captures similar patterns, the 
output  is  often  cluttered  with  incorrect  collocates,  which are  included in  the counts  of  hapax-
legomena, and result in false measures of lexical-richness, (see Baayen, 2008; Evert and Baroni, 
2006).  The data produced by LSA requires no manual processing as a threshold can be set, typically 
>=0.7, to return only the most correlated texts and glyphs, (see Landauer et al., 2004).
The texts and words (or glyphs) are viewed as a high-dimensional multivariate space where all 
occurrences, of a word, are listed row-wise, and the associated texts across columns, with the counts 
in each cell; creating a high-dimensional matrix.  The Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) model, 
47
(see  Manning  et  al.,  2008:407)  provides  LSA with  the  ability  to  represent  the  mechanisms 
underlying human knowledge, (Landauer and Dumais, 1997).  It achieves this by optimising the, 
'prediction of the presence of all other events from those currently identified in a given temporal 
context,  and  does  so  using  all  relevant  information  it  has  experienced',  (Landaur  and Dumais, 
1997:217).  The terms context and event refer to the phenomenon being described.  In this paper, 
context refers to an individual text in the rongorongo corpus, and event relates to a single instance 
of  a  glyph.   In  other  studies  (Landauer  et  al.,  2004),  an  event may also  be  a  word,  syntactic 
construction (through corpus tagging, see Biber et al., 1998), or a paragraph. Likewise, a paragraph 
can be considered a context.
LSA has been empirically tested on a variety of data (Dumais, 1991; Landauer and Dumais, 1997; 
Foltz et al., 1998; Wolfe et al., 1998; Landauer et al., 2004; Dong, et al., 2006; Pino and Eskenazi, 
2009),  and it  appears  to  give  consistent  results.  These  tests  demonstrate  that  the  model  is 
particularly  robust  with  matrices  of  300  dimensions,  however  performance  drops  below  100 
dimensions, and above more than 1000 dimensions, due to limitations in computational power (see 
Landauer et al., 2007:71).  To illustrate, in an initial study as part of this paper, processing a corpus 
of 46 texts, with approximately 100,000 words each, required nearly 32GB of memory, on a high-
end laptop, fitted with only 2.1GB (as of 2010).  Therefore, LSA may not be able to process large 
corpora comparable to the Brown Corpus, unless a series of smaller sample texts are extracted.
A SVD model is generated, in a similar way to factor analysis, and the data-matrix is transformed 
into a series of co-ordinates in high-dimensional space.  This allows the researcher to explore the 
correlation between texts, words, or the correspondence between the two.  In this paper, Pearson's 
correlation  is  used  as  the  measure  of  similarity  between  a  text,  or  glyph.   One  of  the  main 
advantages of using LSA in a corpus-based analysis is that it captures the fact that: 
[…] if  a  particular  stimulus,  X  has  been  associated  with  some  other  
stimulu, Y, by being frequently found in joint context, and Y is associated  
with  Z,  then  the  condensation  can  cause  X  and  Z  to  have  similar  
representations. 
(Landauer, et al., 1997:217).   
In short,  the model measures the probability of a word joining with other words to form larger 
clauses, given their productivity in the current  context. (Landauer et al., 1994:5215).  This entails 
that LSA ignores the ordering of constituents as it is purely interested in the ‘meaning’ attached to 
the documents as opposed to the words contained within, unlike corpus linguistic methods, which

adopt the token as the unit of analysis (see Biber et al., 1998; Gries, 2009).  The resulting data is 
normally plot in a graph to explore possible relationships between text-text, word-word, and text-
word dependencies.  LSA is predicted to perform better than previously mentioned methods as the 
accuracy of a factor analysis relies on: how the method is applied, the decisions behind selecting 
representative features, and the number of 'significant' factors.  LSA processes all texts and words or 
glyphs, in a corpus, to create a latent-semantic space from which additional functions are applied. 
(see Landauer et al., 1997; Wild, 2009).
In  this  paper,  the  rongorongo  corpus  is  transformed  into  a  matrix,  with  the  contexts (tablets) 
organised  by  column  and  the  events  (glyphs),  arranged  in  rows.   The  frequency-counts  are 
calculated  for  each  event in  each  context and  assigned to  the  corresponding  cells.   A Pearson 
correlation is calculated and only the results meeting a >=0.7 threshold are retained.  
The results are presented as a dendrogram to make the relationship between groups more apparent 
(see below).  A correlation value of 1 means that the given word or glyph was expected to appear in 
an infinite corpus of texts.  Lesser values naturally imply that the word or glyph in question is 
unexpected in the current context.  This captures the grammatical or syntactic association between 
glyphs,  highlighting any potential  compounds,  or  structural  correspondence.  For  example,  what 
motivates the presence of glyph <1> given its presence as an independent or main glyph, or as a 
prefix in the compound <1.6>?  
To assess the success or failure of LSA methods applied to glyphs, a term-term analysis is performed 
on an Egyptian corpus, since the values of the glyphs are known.  A glyph is selected on the basis of 
glyph-frequency data.  As with the document-document analysis, a threshold of >=0.7 is set in order 
to return the highest term-to-term similarity scores (positive correlation values).  The final results 
are compared to the factor analysis, bi-gram, tri-gram, and Key Word In Context concordance data 
(KWIC) for validation.

Chapter 5 Presentation of findings
5.1  Feature selection
The feature list is generated from the 100 most productive glyphs and morphemes, and a frequency-
matrix created with the relative-frequency of the features across all texts.  The feature-list was also 
enriched with current hypotheses concerning the significance of particular glyphs, for example the 
crescent moon glyph <40>, plus variants: <41> mirrored, <42> subscript, and <43> superscript, 
(Guy, 1990; Fischer, 1997; Berthin and Berthin, 2006; Melka, 2008; 2009b; 2010; Horley, 2009), 
and the text-divider glyph on the Santiago staff (Ia): <199> and <999> (Fischer, 1997).  
Due to issues associated with relative-frequencies, there is some imbalance in the final features 
selected for classification.  For example, tablets  X,  Y, and  Z, have only two glyphs, each one is 
attributed  with  a  relative-frequency of  0.5,  (or  50%).  Therefore,  when  sorting  the  n-grams  in 
descending-order, they are ranked amongst the top-frequencies.  Consequently it was necessary to 
remove them from the rest of the analysis.  This decision was extended to texts: J, M, and W due to 
their small sample-size, or fragmentary nature (damaged areas).  
5.2  Principal components analysis
After the initial feature selection, a PCA was performed (Baayen, 2008), and a scree-plot produced 
to identify how many PCs are required to explain the majority of the variance in the data-set, hence 
enabling  the  reduction  of  the  number  of  variables.   The  general  rule  adopted  is  that  only the 
significant PCs accounting for over 5% of the variance should be selected for further analysis. 
50
Figure 8. Scree plots (rongorongo data-sets)
The scree plot shows that the first  three  PCs explain the majority of the variance.  These  PCs 
account for almost 75% of the variance in data-set 4 (see figure 8).
 
Figure 9. PCA (rongorongo dataset)
The graph (figure 9) shows the resulting PCA scatter plot. The data-points show some separation 
and what appears to be a cluster of texts (referring to PC1 against PC2) with a few texts separated 
from this main group. In addition it is possible to see how much variability there is in the data on 
different combinations of  PCs, for example,  PC2 and PC3 show less scatter than the comparison 
between PC1 and PC2.
51
It is not clear which texts are associated with which clusters.  However, PCA provides a means for 
reducing the number of variables needed to explain the underlying structure of the data-set.  In 
addition, it is possible to spot any clustering, which is important for the remainder of the analysis, 
as they are based on text-categorisation methods. 
5.3  Factor analysis: Rongorongo corpus
A factor analysis, with  varimax rotation, was applied to the same frequency-matrix as the  PCA. 
Three factors were selected, and a separate analysis performed with promax rotation. 
The factor analysis reveals the actual texts that are part of the clusters identified by the PCA.  One 
issue that needs to be addressed is how to explain what these groups represent, and how to justify 
the inclusion of a text with any of the members in its cluster.  There are roughly four main groups; 
measured by their proximity to other texts as highlighted by the curves dividing the texts (see figure 
10).  These texts are distributed across the graph, forming a left-right distinction (highlighted by the 
dashed line).  It is not possible to state with any certainty where the texts should be divided.  As an 
example, text La could be part of group 3 or 4 as it is almost equal in distance from any single text 
in either group.  It is apparent, that these results alone do not make it possible to make any definite 
decision, though they do provide a basis for exploring the corpus.
52
Figure 10. Plot of factor analysis of rongorongo (DD4) with varimax (left), and promax rotation (right).
The texts are quite dispersed in the first plot (figure 9, left), but the promax-based analysis shows 
clearer clusters forming, (figure 10, right).  Group 1 (H, P, and Q) are known parallel-passages and 
are expected to be similar in terms of genre, (see in particular Barthel, 1958:82-168; Horley, 2007a). 
As for group 2, texts Gr, Kr, and Kv cluster together at the top of the plot, joined by two additional 
texts:  Na and  Ev.  The similarity of the  Small Santiago (Gr), and  London tablet (Kr and  Kv) is 
confirmed by internal analysis of the script showing that tablet (K) is a copy of one side of the 
Small Santiago (Gr), (see Barthel, 1958). 
In group 3, the Mamari tablet (Ca and Cb) is at the centre of the plot with texts Rb, Xa, Sa, and Fa 
in close proximity.  This may indicate that these texts contain some content similar to the tablet C. 
This group is partly driven by the presence of the 'crescent moon' glyph <40>, occurring twice on 
53
the  Stephen-Chauvet  Fragment (lines  Fa3  and  Fa4).   By  comparison,  there  are  many  more 
instances of this glyph on tablet  C, and Er (another possible calendar sequence, see  Wieczorek, 
2010), which is also in proximity to tablet C, but seems to form its own group with the verso of the 
Small Santiago (Gv), and one side of the Stephen-Chauvet fragment (Fb), designated group 4.  
Group 4 in the bottom-left  of  the plot,  includes  the  Santiago staff (Ia).   This  text  is  the most 
separated from the other groups, with only a number of fragmented-texts (Wa, Ya, and Va) included 
in this group.  Internal analysis of the inscription shows that its structure is very different to the 
other tablets: a X1YZ structure, proposed by Fischer (1997).  Text Ia is also joined by the Honolulu 
text (Ta).  The similarity between tablet I and T, is already noted by Barthel (1958:167).  
Turning  to  an  assessment  of  the  classification  obtained;  it  is  assumed that  a  correlation  exists 
between text Aa, and Hr, Pr, and Qr, due to the shared sequence appearing on Aa1 (repeated on Hr5, 
Pr5, and Qr5, see Guy, 1985:383), instead the opposite side (Ab) is grouped with these texts (see 
group 1).  Horley (2007a) shows that this is attributed to the presence of shared glyph-sequences on 
Ab2 and Ab4, which are also present on Pr7.  Text Aa has sequences in common with Hr, Pr, and Qr, 
including a group of glyphs <1-9a>, also present on text Ra (line 5-8).  This may point to a fixed-
glyphic compound, although on  Ra, the compound is expanded with the addition of fused-glyph 
<5> (Horley, 2007a:27), with further examples of this form on texts Bv and Sa. The factor analysis 
illustrates this to some degree, although text Sa is separated from the rest of the group suggesting 
that  there  are  other  features  with  more  influence  over  the  categorisation:  one  sequence  is  the 
compound <380.1> on  Cb.  Barthel (1958), and Horley (2007:28) observe that this compound is 
quite productive (with instances on texts: Ab, Ca, Cb, Ev, Gr, Kr, Kv, and Na).  The factor analysis 
splits texts with this delimiter into two groups, group 2 and group 3, appearing at the top-left of the 
graph, the others appearing in the middle and drifting to the lower part of the graph.  The difference 
between these two groups, which share the compound <380.1>, may be caused by the presence of 
glyph <40>.  
The question to ask at this stage, is whether these observations point to there being two list-types: 
one a genealogical text, the other a mix of genealogical and calendar sequences (for example a 
significant  date  attributed  to  a  number  of  individuals).   However,  it  is  not  possible  to  draw 
conclusions purely on this basis alone.
54
5.4  N-grams
An analysis of bi-gram and tri-grams reveals which glyphs are driving the classification of texts in 
the factor analysis.  It appears from frequency-data that the four groups can be reduced to at least 
three due to the presence of the previously mentioned shared-sequences. The frequency-data also 
shows which texts contribute little to the classification of each group of texts.  There is cause to 
rearrange some texts from the factor analysis, as they share bi-grams and tri-grams more in common 
with texts  in  other  neighbouring groups (for example,  texts  Ev and  Gr have some bi-grams in 
common with text Gv, Ia and Ta):
Table 6. The most productive bi-grams in the rongorongo corpus.
Table 6 presents the top 15 results from the bi-gram analysis.  Only glyph-compounds that appear 
on several texts  are retained as they are likely to be true compounds, rather than ‘junk’ strings 
caused by the concatenation process.  The bi-gram data supports a distinction between three broad 
groups as opposed to the four illustrated in the factor analysis.  Therefore the groups are re-arranged 
according to the number of shared bi-grams, for example bi-grams on text Gv compared to Ia, and 
Ta, show that  Gv should be moved to  group 4.  Also,  group 2  (Ev,  Gr,  Kr,  Kv,  Na, in figure 10), 
shares more glyph-sequences with texts of group 4.
A correspondence  between  bi-grams  and  the  type  of  texts  they  appear  on,  appears  to  exist. 
However, it  is apparent that some texts are damaged, and therefore not reliably classifiable, for 
example some texts have hardly any shared glyphs, or do not appear in the top-ranks, (Fb, Ma, Oa, 
and Fa, respectively).  It is therefore questionable whether these texts should be included.  The texts 
in  group  2 are  more  homogeneous:  there  are  examples  of  the  delimiter-list  glyph-compound 
55
<380.1> across all texts in this group.  Group 2 consequently needs some adjustment or removal of 
texts Er and Fb as they share few bi-grams with the rest of the texts in this group.  The statistics 
show that Fb has glyph-compounds in common with other texts, for example: <200-96> appearing 
once on both  Fb and on  Gv,  and the 'moon' glyphs.   With so few occurrences it does not seem 
justifiable to include Fb in the corpus, and so it is removed from the rest of this analysis.  Texts Ca, 
Cb, and Sa show some correspondence with group 2,  again, due to the presence of <380.1>, as a 
result  this  classification still  appears  to be far  from perfect.   In conclusion,  the factor  analysis 
categorises the tablets with delimiter  <380.1>, and <76> on the left  of the chart,  and the more 
diverse texts, or those with less structured-lists (i.e. group 1), on the right of the plot.   
Table 7. The most productive tri-grams in the rongorongo corpus.
The tri-gram data reveals that texts Ca and Cb from group 3 should perhaps be included with group 
2, due to the productivity of <380.1>.  However, what seems to separate these texts is the presence 
of the 'moon' glyph <40>, plus variants (<41>, <42>, and <43>).  This may indicate three general 
groups; those with glyph <40> and delimiter <380.1> (group 2-3, figure 10); another with glyphs 
<76> and <380.1> represented by the texts appearing in group 4 (figure 10); and those with fewer 
delimiter-glyph, (group 1, figure 10)   
The tri-gram data show that text Ia and Ta contain both the <380.1> delimiter and <76>, with Gr 
showing a few occurrences of <1.380>, meaning they could be moved to  group 3, however they 
lack the fully expanded version <1-380.1> and the more common <380.1.3>.  Once again, it seems 
necessary to revise the previously defined groups.  Some texts show hardly any shared tri-grams: in 
group 1 (Aa, Br, Bv, Da, Db, Ma, Nb, Oa, Ra, and Sb),  group 2 (Er, Fb, and Gv), and group 3 (Rb, 
and Sa).  In conclusion, at this stage of the analysis, it is assumed that there are at least three main

groups,  with  maximally  a  fourth  should  the  remainder  of  the  analysis  support  one.   A latent 
semantic analysis (LSA) will provide confirmation on the validity of the current classification by 
explaining the degree of correlation between each of the texts.
5.5  Factor analysis: Language corpus.
Turning to the language corpora, the factor analysis failed to identify any particular groups, in fact 
the programs reported an error in the factor analysis algorithm.  The matrix was composed of only 
312 texts, with the frequency-counts of the top 100 morphemes as features.  To investigate the issue, 
a correspondence analysis was performed to show the amount of variance between the texts, and the 
loadings of each morpheme. (see figure 11).
57
Figure 11. Correspondence plot of the influence of morpheme loadings on texts.
The correspondence plot shows that the data is very skewed resulting in the texts being bunched 
together.  This is because the features fail to draw out any significant difference in structure. Only 
two texts  have  separated  from the  rest,  a  Rapanui  song (Ate-a-renga hokan iti  poheraa)  from 
Thomson (1889), and a Maori song (He Mata na te Kahu-kore) from Grey (1853). It is not possible, 
with these two results alone, to conclude that there has been any success.  The two song texts are 
too far apart to suggest any relationship and the scores on the factors account for only 15.6% of the 
variance in the data, hence the skew.
58
A possible  explanation  for  this  is  polysemy.   Synonymy  and  polysemy  is  rife  in  Polynesian 
languages due to the restricted set of phonemes (only nine consonants, ten if we include the glottal 
stop, and five vowels, see De Feu, 1996).  There are a large set of homophones with more than one 
interpretation, particularly in the case of syntax markers: for example /a/, acts as a possessive (De 
Feu, 1996:11), and person marker (De Feu, 1996:12).  Tregear (1891) reveals further examples 
of:  /a/  =  'collar-bone',  'god',  'an interjection',  the  plural  of  particle  /ta/,  and 'to  drive',  or  'urge' 
(Tregear, 1891:1).  The word /hoki/ is a verb 'to return', but examples also exist of other word-types 
including: 'also', 'for', or 'because', and as the name for a fish, (Tregear, 1891:79).  Therefore, it is 
likely  that  many  of  these  morphemes  represent  other  word-classes  such  as  noun,  verb,  and 
preposition.   The  matrix  is  composed of  morphemes  with  the  highest-frequency in  the corpus, 
which are generally 'function words' (Mosteller and Wallace, 1964; Evert and Baroni, 2005; 2006). 
However, the actual 'function' of a morpheme proposed to be part of the syntax of the language is 
obscured by polysemy.  In addition, there is evidence to suggesting Maori poetry has a different 
structure  compared  to  everyday  usage.   The  comments  of  Rev.  R  Maunsell,  illustrates  the 
complications in interpreting Maori poetry:
We shall see that it was not only abrupt and elliptical to an excess not  
allowed in English poetry, but that it also carries its license so far as to  
disregard rules of  grammar that are strictly observed in prose; alters  
words so as to make them sound more poetically; deals most arbitrarily  
with the length of syllables, and sometimes even inverts their order, or  
adds other syllables.   
(cf. Grey, 1853:xiii-xiv)
The issues attributed to these genres is materialised in the form of omissions, including; articles /ko/ 
and  /te/,  /ai/,   pronouns,  particles  i.e.  /nei/,  the  nominative  case,  verbs,  and  prepositions.   In 
addition, there is substitution of one preposition for another, unusual or rare words introduced or 
inverted,  (see Maunsell,  1862).   The same phenomenon is  paralleled in the  rongorongo  corpus 
where whole passages may undergo, 'significant re-phrasing' (Horley, 2007a:31).  Consequently it is 
likely that these issues have an impact on the statistical analysis, as observed in the correspondence 
plot.  One way to address this is to tag the corpus, however, for the purposes of this study, time 
constraints associated with handling large corpora (see Biber et al., 1998) was an issue due to the 
different transcription principles, and the multilingual nature of the corpora.
Applying factor analysis methods to collections of multivariate data can be complicated, and many 
of  the decisions  relating to  feature  selection  are  fairly subjective,  followed by the  selection  of 
factors believed to be appropriate to elicit structures present in the data.   As a result,  it  is not 
59
possible to make a decision regarding which of the rongorongo texts are similar in terms of genre 
based on these results alone.  Therefore, we move to an analysis of lexical-richness through the 
application of frequency spectrum, Vocabulary Growth Curves (VGC), and  Baayen's Productivity  
Index (see Baayen, 2001). 
5.6  Frequency spectrum and VGCs as tests for lexical-richness
As discussed  previously,  a  test  of  lexical-richness  based  on  the  application  of  Baayen's  P,  or 
productivity-index,  is   calculated by dividing the  number of  hapax-legomena by the number of 
tokens (V1/Vm).  This calculation will provide a measure of how lexically-rich the texts are.  A 
lexically-rich  text  will  have  a  high  productivity-index,  as  more  and  more  new  words  are 
encountered as sample-size increases.  A narrative text, for example, may have a low score, and will 
display a straight-line showing that the number of types have been fully sampled, and no more are 
expected, despite an increase in sample-size.  In comparison, a list of unique individuals or entities 
will show a steep curve upwards as each new type V is a hapax-legomenona (V1).
To compensate  for  the  difference  in  sample-size,  which  distort  measures  of  lexical-richness,  a 
Generalised Inverse Gauss Poisson LNRE model was implemented as it, 'achieves excellent results' 
(Evert  and  Baroni,  2005:14),  in  order  to  account  for  the  number  of  unseen  or  expected  types 
(E[Vm]) predicted by the Large Number of Rare Events (see Baayen, 2001).  The  Generalized 
Inverse Gauss Poisson (GIGP) model is more efficient at modelling the hapax-legomena than the 
rest of the spectrum frequency compared to the finite  finite Zipf-Mandlebrot model (fZM), which 
supposedly adjusts the top and bottom ranks to comply more fully with Zipfs (1949) straight-line in 
a rank/frequency plot, (see Evert and Baroni, 2006).  This was the same result for all texts and 
GIGP was  therefore  selected  as  the  best  fitting  model  for  extrapolating  the  texts  to  the  larger 
sample-size.
60
Figure 12. Comparison of the number of types predicted by FZM and GIGP LNRE models of text Aa (E[Vm]),  
and the number of observed types (Vm).
A model for each text is created by applying bi-nominal interpolation to the empirical growth curve, 
followed by extrapolation up to the size of the largest text, (see figure 13 for an example).  This 
provides a smoother curve by computing a series of randomised permutations over the distribution 
of the words (or glyphs) to compensate for the non-randomness of word distributions, which would 
result in an incorrect model of the extrapolated VGC curve.  
The interpolated VGC is extrapolated to the sample-size of the Santiago staff (Ia), the largest of the 
texts at N(2594).  The results are plotted alongside the empirical VGC of each text.  The parameters 
of the model are estimated by the Zipf package (Evert and Baroni, 2006), see  figure 12, above, and 
table 8, below.

The parameters of the model can be adjusted to provide a better fit, however this would involve a 
trial and error approach for each individual text. The goodness-of-fit based on the estimated values 
are close enough for the purposes of this study.  To assess the model's success, a high P-value and a 
low chi-squared score is required, (see Baayen,  2008).

Table 9. Observed and modelled values for ranked-frequencies for text Aa.
Despite the poor estimation of the frequency of words at ranks V4, and V5 (those occurring four and 
five times, respectively), the only values actually required are the total number of expected types 
(V) and the hapax-legomena (V1), for Baayen's P.   The main benefit of applying such a model is to 
address the issues relating to the comparison of texts at differing sample-size.  Below (figure 13), is 
an example of the resulting fit for text  Aa, showing the empirical, bi-nominally interpolated, and 
extrapolated curve at the size of the largest text (Ia,  N=2594).
62
Figure 13. Number of types V(N) compared to the expected number of types E[V(N)] for empirical and modelled 
VGC (interpolated and extrapolated curves).
The end of the empirical curve of text Aa is apparent at approximately N(1000), where the straight 
line reflects  no further  growth in  vocabulary.   The  interpolated curve follows the slope of  the 
empirical  curve  fairly well  until  about  N(450)  where  the  empirical  curve  begins  to  diverge  as 
observed by Baayen (2001), and Evert and Baroni (2006), in their studies, hence the reasoning 
behind extrapolating from an bi-nominally interpolated growth curve, and not from the empirical 
VGC11.   After  fitting the  GIGP  model,  Baayen's P is calculated over each text,  and plotted for 
comparison, (see figure 14).
11.  The interpolated-curve smooths the empirical curve in order to prevent the extrapolated curve from being calculated on wildly 
fluctuating values caused by the LNRE and the non-randomness of word distributions.  
63
Figure 14.  Measure of Baayen's P for texts in the rongorongo corpus at N(2594).
Comparing the groups identified by the factor analysis and the results of the lexical-richness test, 
shows some correspondence between the graph above (figure 14), and the factor analysis (figure 
10).  For example, the similar Baayen's P value for texts Ab, Bv, Hv, Pv, La, Sb, and Bv (the texts 
forming  group 1),  which are joined  by texts  Ia,  and  Ta,  showing a  similar  amount  of  lexical-
richness.  The variation between Gv and texts  Ia and Ta, despite its similarities in terms of glyph 
usage (glyph <76> delimiter), is now more apparent, it is lexically-richer.  In addition, texts with the 
delimiter  <380.1> or with many list-like structures (Horley,  2007a),  are  generally those with a 
Baayen's P  value lower than 0.2.  
In conclusion, texts Da, Gv, and Aa are the most lexically-rich texts.  And the right-side of the plot 
illustrates the list-like texts, which are the least lexically-rich.  Given that the assumption is that lists 
are lexically-richer than narrative discourse, the plot does not appear to support this hypothesis. 
However, texts Aa, Bv, Cb, Da, Gv, Ia, Sb, and Ta, do actually appear to have a large number of list-
like sequences, for example: texts Aa and Ab with glyph-sequence <25.9:5, and variant 1.9:5>; on 
tablet Br, a sequence marked with glyph <384> in line Br3, later replaced by glyph <63>, in Br6; 
and Cb with <4-760> and <380.1> glyph delimiters.  
However, if texts are composed of more than one text per tablet-side, the model may not estimate 
the correct VGC for some texts.  This is where proper segmentation is required in order to be sure 
that these results are valid.  Inspecting the resulting VGC of each text, reveals whether this holds 
true.  As an example, the Santiago staff (Ia) has a sharper increase in new types, as the number of 
glyphs encountered (N) increases (see figure 15).  However, the empirical  VGC reveals that there 
64
exists the possible presence of multiple sub-texts. 
Figure 15. VGC plot of the Santiago staff (Ia).
The Santiago staff (Ia) is likely to be one text genre given the prevalence of glyph <76> across the 
whole text, forming a long list.  The plot shows, however, four or five possible list-types due to the 
observed peak in the hapax-legomena, (marked by the arrows).  To confirm whether this is indeed 
the case a discourse map, (see Biber et al., 1998:122-130), was produced for text Ia, with the most 
frequently occurring glyphs (<1> to <11>), a number of delimiter glyphs (<76>, and <380>), the 
crescent  moon glyphs  (<40> to  <42>, as they may represent  calendar  sequences),  and the text 
delimiter  (glyph  <999>),  which  provides  more  information  on  the  organisation  of  the  whole 
inscription.
65
Figure 16. Discourse map of the Santiago staff (Ia)
The large number of occurrences and distribution of glyph <76> (figure 16), reveals that the text 
itself is probably one genre.  The text delimiter glyph <999> is less frequent, but is again distributed 
throughout the length of the text, and shows a number of breaks and packed groups, see for example 
dense clusters at N(750) and N(1750).  In addition, other glyphs may indicate smaller thematically-
related passages.   To illustrate,  glyph <1> and <2>,  like <76>, is  distributed across  the whole 
inscription.   Whereas  glyphs  <4>,  <5>,  <6>,  <7>,  and  <380>  are  clustered  together  in  small 
passages repeated in isolated sections of the text.  Two glyphs are of particular interest, glyph <40> 
and <41> (the mirror image of glyph <40>).  If glyph <41> is synonymous with glyph <40>, then 
there are five instances, evenly distributed throughout the text.  Glyph <42> also occurs five times, 
but after the first instance of glyph <40> and <41>, at approximately N(1250).  The distribution of 
these glyphs corresponds to the peaks in the VGC and hapax-legomena.  However, to claim that this 
is the mechanism underlying the VGC, in that there are five significant dates dividing up these five 
textual fragments into some inventory or list of names, is probably too strong a claim to make based 
on these results alone.  
To  explore  this  idea  further,  a  discourse  map  is  created  for  the  Mamari  tablet  (text  Ca) for 
comparison, (figure 17).  Note the 'moon' glyphs (<40>, <41>, and <42>) and their distribution.  It 
is  very  clear  where  this  calendar  resides  in  the  text.   In  addition,  glyph  <8>  appears  to  be 
structurally-related or  dependent  on this  sequence of  'moon'  glyphs,  corresponding to  the same 
position  in  the  text,  perhaps  indicating  a  semantic  or  syntactic  correspondence.   The  other 
hypothesis is that this is a sub-text, as the distribution of glyphs <1> and <380> (i.e. the delimiter), 
66
appears to be mutually-exclusive to the 'moon' glyphs. 
Figure 17. Discourse map of the Mamari tablet (Ca)
From the  statistics  of  the  VGCs  and the  structures  illustrated  by the  discourse maps  it  can  be 
demonstrated which texts are likely to be similar in terms of their literary-genre, and where some 
texts may be composed of multiple fragments.  However, it may be argued that there are a number 
of  interpretations  for  the  charts.   In  particular  the  VGCs  of  each  text  may  not  show  where 
segmentation can be made as they are not designed to measure this.  In order to test the hypothesis 
that  VGCs  can  act  as  predictors  for  segmentation,  or  for  identifying  sub-texts,  an  additional 
experiment is performed.   
Two texts are selected from the Maori corpus.  The first is a sample of the prose text Hinemoa, with 
a  sample-size  of  N(2000),  the  second  is  created  by  concatenating  a  series  of  short  Maori 
genealogical  texts  of  the  structure:  Ko [NOUN],  Ko [NOUN]  etc.  up  to  a  sample-size  of 
approximately N(500).  Three final texts are generated through replacement of 500 tokens from the 
Hinemoa text with the genealogical text resulting in the same total sample-size of  N(2000).  The 
three modified texts are composed of the genealogical text at the beginning, middle, and end of the 
text Hinemoa.  It is predicted that the difference between the two text genres will be obvious due to 
the variation in the number of  hapax-legomena.  Figure 18 shows the original sample texts.  Note 
the steep curve for the hapax-legomena of the genealogical text, indicating a high number of new 
types as we move through the sample (N).  By comparison, the Hinemoa text is considered to be 
one whole prose text with less variability and lexical-richness than the genealogical text illustrated 
by its curve and the small fluctuations in the distribution of new types.  Turning to the experimental 
texts (below), the presence of the genealogical text is clearly distinguishable as it moves though the 
67
Hinemoa text from the beginning (figure 19.a), middle (figure 19.b), and end (figure 19.c).

a.) b.) c.)
Figure 19. Plot of VGC and V1 for experimental texts illustrating sharp increase of hapax-legomena.  The 
genealogical text is marked by dashed-lines.
In conclusion,  VGCs provide a good indicator of change in discourse or literary type.   Hapax-
legomena are  particularly  important,  the  graphs  display  a  high  number  of  hapax-legomena 
indicating  a  text  where  each  word  sampled  is  new,  and  generates  a  steep  upward  curve  in 
comparison to a prose or narrative text. Therefore VGCs may act as good predictors of sub-texts in 
the  rongorongo corpus and where to segment the  rongorongo texts in order to improve statistical 
measures.   Golcher  (2007),  on  analysing  the  undeciphered  Voynich  manuscript,  developed  an 
‘original constant’ that may be more stable than ZipfR, though ‘probably also trickier to compute’ 
68
(Baroni,  2010,  personal  communication).   Therefore,  more  work  is  needed  before  it  can  be 
demonstrated that VGC data can be used as a guide for segmentation, or shift in discourse-type.
5.7  Latent semantic analysis
5.7.1  Document-document analysis
The LSA is predicted to provide more tangible results compared to a factor analysis.  Although a 
factor analysis can be successful in spatially orientating apparent similarities between texts, the 
researcher is still left to decide where the groups begin and end, and how far the influence extends. 
In addition, lexical-richness tests can tell us how rich the vocabulary is in a text, but this does not 
equate to the text having any form of shared-content.  With  LSA there is less subjectivity, as the 
similarity  between  texts  (documents),  and  glyphs  (terms)  can  be  measured  according  to  their 
correlation.  Therefore, texts are measured by being similar in terms of the glyphs that are present, 
and the structures that  put these glyphs together into a larger phrases.  LSA not only identifies 
collocations  along  similar  lines  to  bi-gram,  tri-gram  or  KWIC  data,  but  also  any  structural-
dependencies existing between constituents present further on in the text.  Pearson's correlation is 
used here as a measure of text and glyph similarity (see Landauer, et al.,  1994; Wild,  2009 on 
Cosine measures). 
The results (table 10), show the correspondence between texts.  Here, LSA has correctly identified 
texts predicted by both the factor analysis and n-gram data  (group 1).

due to the number of shared passages (Kudrjavtsev, 1949).  Text Pr shows the strongest correlation 
(0.89) with  Hr than  Qr.  Similarly,  Pv has a higher correlation with  Hv, compared to  Qv at 0.86. 
The difference between Hr and Pr, compared to Qr is probably caused by damage or allography.12 
This is confirmed by plotting their VGCs (see figure 20, below).
Figure 20. VGC plot of texts Hr, Pr, and Qr, explaining variation in observed results for LSA.
The VGC of the recto side of each tablet, shows that text Qr is shorter than the other parallel-texts 
(Hr, and Pr), which explains the slight differences observed in previous results (i.e. factor analysis, 
and now LSA).  
The second group (table 11), identified by the factor analysis, reveals that texts  Kr, and  Kv are 
similar to one side of the Small Santiago (Gr), (see figure 1.b, above).  Text Ev shows a degree of 
correlation with Gr, Kr, and Kv, more so than text Na.  All these texts share the compound <380.1>, 
although differences exist with respect to the glyphs occurring between this delimiter.  Although 
text Gr and tablet K are one text considered a ‘list’, Ev and Na may also be of the same genre-type, 
but listing different individuals or dates, for example.
12.  The fact that tablet  H and P are so correlated would point to there being less allographic variation between them, an example 
exists between the head-shapes of glyph <205> and <305> in line 5 of Hr, Pr, and Qr, (see figure 1.a), possibly implying the work of 
a separate scribe.
70
Table 11. Pair wise correlation between texts of group 2.
The texts Ia, Ta, and Gv in group 3 (see figure 10, and table 12), show the most correlation, of all 
texts currently analysed.  The correlation between Ia and Ta suggests that text Ta may be a copy of 
Ia, supported in part by the bi-gram data (above) where text Ia and Ta share many compound-forms 
not present in text Gv.
Table 12. Pair wise correlation between texts of group 3.
Group 4 (table 13) shows little correlation between any texts, as per the results of the n-gram. 
Therefore these texts may represent separate genres from the rest of the corpus, or the classification 
according to the factor analysis  is incorrect.   Text  Fa is fragmented and so there is no reliable 
correlation.  
Table 13. Pair wise correlation between texts of group 4.
The LSA is performed again with removal of the fragmented texts (Fa, Fb, Ma, and Oa), and small 
samples (La, Ua, Va,  Wa, Xa, Ya, Yb, and Za).   Texts showing a correlation between both sides of 
the  tablet  are  joined  together,  (texts  Ca and  Cb,  Hr and  Hv,  Pr and  Pv),  or  where  previous 
palaeographic research point to a duplicate copy, (texts Kr and Kv a copy of text Gr).

A hierarchical-cluster  analysis  is  applied  using  agglomerative-clustering  in  order  to  locate  the 
groups  identified  by  the  LSA.   The  document-document  similarity  values  (correlations)  are 
converted to  a distance-object  by squaring over  the correlation matrix,  to  compensate  for non-
negative values required by the rest of the analysis.  The results of the distance-object represent the 
dissimilarities  between two groups,  equal  to  the maximum value of the dissimilarities  between 
individual texts in the group (see Baayen, 2008:138; Johnson, 2008:183-192).  These are plotted as 
a dendrogram, with the groups identified by the links between the texts (see figure 21).
Figure 21. Dendrogram of rongorongo texts based on the LSA data of the sub-corpora.
The plot shows two main groups divided into roughly five sub-groups.   The texts forming linked-
pairs i.e. Ia and Ta, Gr and K, H and Q etc. are highly correlated.  The two main groups appear to be 
divided between tablets with large numbers of delimiter-groups (see Horley, 2007a:27), and those 
that may be considered narrative or prose structured texts.  This does not mean they are all of the 
same genre, as there is still a distinction between texts delimited with glyph compound <380.1>, 
and those with glyph <76>, (see group 2 in table 11, and group 3, table 12).  
72
Horley (2007a:28) identifies shared-glyph sequences between Ev and text Ab, and Pr, and between 
texts Ab, Ca, Cb, Ev, and Pr.  There are, however, more shared-glyphs between texts: Ab - Ra - Gr,  
Cb - Ev - Gr - Kv - Na, and Aa - Pr, see Horley (2007a:28), for examples.  Therefore, it is certainly 
the  case  that  the  groups  may  be  skewed  by  the  presence  of  these  fragments,  however,  the 
categorisation is driven by the correlation between texts, grouped according to how much they have 
in common overall.  Consequently, this provides a general view of the main groups, which can be 
improved once we are  aware of the proper segmentation.   In addition,  it  is  possible that  these 
shared-sequences  relate  to  commonly  used  set-phrases,  or  formulaic  introductory  expressions, 
therefore the presence of these shared-glyphs may not be the final decider of literary-genre.

Table 14.  Summary of text clusters and revised groupings (highlighted columns represent the main links  
between possible sub-genres).
Group 1 supports the results seen previously in the factor analysis, showing the correlation between 
texts Gv, Ia and Ta.  Group 2 agrees with the factor analysis.  Group 3 contains the parallel-passages 
of tablets H, P, and Q, with the slight separation of tablet P, and the similarity between these texts 
and text  A is also apparent (Guy, 1985:383).  Group 4 and  5 shows a distinction between the the 
parallel-texts  (Gr,  Kr,  and  Kv),  and the rest  of the inscriptions,  (those with the delimiter-glyph 
compound <380.1>).   Furthermore, group 5 contains the lunar-calendar series (Ca, and Cb) and a 
repetitive  lunar-sequence  on  one  side  of  the  Keiti tablet  (Er),  (Wieczorek,  2010).   The  final 
classification, agrees to an extent with that concluded by Barthel (1958).  However, the hierarchical 
clustering shows that some texts are less associated with the ones proposed by Barthel (1958), but 
still part of the general category if we consider the top level clusters: the relationship between the 
parallel-passages H, P, and Q, and tablet A, which are seemingly related to some extent, with some 
slight separation.  The statistics also support previous extensive internal-structural  analyses (see 
Horley, 2007a; 2007b; 2010), which identify the shared-sequences through palaeographic methods.
In conclusion, these groups appear to support previous research.  If the list-like texts of groups 4-5 
represent  one broad-genre,  for  example a  funerary texts,  then we may 'expect  that  they would 
present slightly different versions of the same text, as happens with Egyptian funeral texts' (Horley, 
73
2007a:31), hence the range of texts in these groups.  
As a result, the glyphs between  delimiter-glyphs, may represent 'personal names'.  Group 1 and 2 
reflect a separate list-like genre, and the  prose-like texts (group 3), could represent 'short songs' 
(kaikai), or 'prayers or charms' (Horley, 2007a:31).  What the broad groups of inscription represent, 
whether the distinction is between  prose versus structured-lists,  is still  unknown.  It can not be 
assumed  that  the  surviving  tablets  represent  the  wealth  of  rongorongo literary-genre  (Melka, 
2009a:116), and consequently, the classification presented here may hint that there are a restricted 
set of surviving genre.
The above methods and procedures are applied to the language corpora, which previously showed 
little discrimination between texts in the factor analysis.  Due to space restrictions the dendrogram 
plot is summarised by mapping the genre assigned to each text in the meta-data, rather than the 
name of each text individually.  This reveals the main clusters formed by the  genres, presented 
below (figure 22).
Figure 22. Dendrogram of language corpora based on LSA data
The results of hierarchical clustering show, that two broad categories exist, one group composed of 
genres between haka and recitation before speaking, with another sub-category consisting of kaikai 
and  war chant  genres.  The last cluster  is split between  prose, RR  (the Jaussen texts.  Barthel, 
74
1958:173-199), and song.
The groups appear to be part of a broader category of genre: haka, incantation, lament, love song,  
lullaby, pepeha,  and  recitation before speaking may be classified as instances of 'ceremonial'  or 
'public address'  performance,  with a related sub-genre of 'chant'  denoted by  kaikai (see Blixen, 
1979), and war chant (see Grey, 1853:39, 67, 72).  Kaikai songs were apparently used as 'magical 
spells  or  charms'  (Horley,  2007a:31).   Some  examples,  are  found  in  Campbell  (1971:93-120), 
'Cantos  de  Aku -  songs  of  the  spirits',  which  may  have  been  chanted  for  protection  against 
malevolent spirits.  Horley (2007a: 31) highlights the list-like structure of some kaikai songs.  The 
fact that the  kaikai category is included as part of the  incantation genre is an interesting parallel 
given their use as 'magic spells', and similar structure with repeat passages (marked in bold and 
italics):
KAIKAI HANUANUA MEA Y PIKEA 'URI
1.  Ka hau e, ka hau nga'e he ka hau te nukunuku ka Kava'aro, ka Kavatu'a kakokako. 
2.  A Ure a Ohovehi ku kahakihia a e Nga Ihu
3.  More a Pua Katiki e hiahia pua mauku 'uta tangitangi pua mauku tai [...]
(Blixen, 1979)
A pepeha is a Maori 'introductory text' used to introduce oneself to an individual or group, detailing 
your ancestors and place of origin.  A recitation before speaking may similarly be viewed as an 
instance of an 'introductory text'.   Laments were sung when something affected the community 
negatively, such as a funeral, with the often crowd singing the chorus.  Grey (1853:10) recorded one 
such  lament, 'Ko Te  Tangi  A Te  Ikaherengutu,  Mo Ana  Tamariki,  I  Mate  Taua  Etahi,  I  Mate  
Kongenge Etahi', which was, 'sung by Te Wherowhero, on the death of his brother kati, […]', and is, 
'always sung by the aged chiefs if many members of their family die'.  Another lament was sung on, 
'the occasion of the Governor quitting Taupo in 1819', (Grey, 1853:70), showing that they were not 
restricted to the  death of family members.  An example of a lament showing group participation, 
sung  in  chorus,  appears  below.   The  parts  sung  by  the  group  are  marked  by  italics,  (Grey, 
1853:118):
HE TANGI, MO TE MATE TURORO.
1. Mate kino, mate kino! 
2. Mate taurekareka! 
3. Me he mate taua pea koe, 
75
4. Tataia he toroa, 
5. Hoea i, te moana pea. 
In terms of the haka, this shows similar parallels with laments, in that a chief orator leads the group, 
with the group singing the chorus, below.  This text also illustrates the issues concerning repetition 
and elliptical phrases (mentioned above).

14. A te kai a te koioio.
                                (Grey, 1853:79)
An example of an incantation (Grey, 1853:58), shows similar parallels with the other examples, 
(below).  What is particularly evident from this example is the number of repeat phrases (in bold 
and italics).  There are two main verses repeated (see Grey, 1853:40, 61-62, 107, for further 
examples of repeated passages):
MO TE TAANGA NGUTU KAUAE, MO TE WAHINE, TENEI WAIATA 
KARAKIA WHAKAWAI. 
1. Takoto ra, e hine, 
2. Pirori e, 
3. Kia taia o ngutu, 
4. Pirori e, 
5. Mo to haerenga atu, ki nga whare tapere, 
6. I kiia ana mai, 
7. Ko hea tenei wahine kino ? 
8. E haere mai nei. 
9. Takoto ra, e hine

14. Pirori e 
15. Mo to haerenga, ki nga whare matoro, 
16. E kiia ana mai koe, 
17. Ko hea tenei wahine ngutu whero ? 
18. E haere mai nei. [...] 
(Grey, 1853:58)
Consequently, it would seem plausible to attribute the category of 'public oration' or 'chant' to the 
first group at the (top of the chart), which all show some form of formulaic expression, repeated 
sequences, or removal of some syntax particles (note line 5 and 15, and the insertion of additional 
content at lines 13-14).  
The second category may be described as 'folklore' or 'narrative' genre with the texts classified as 
song being a possible misclassification, perhaps the genre poetry.  The rongorongo (RR) texts (cf.  
Barthel,  1958)  of  the  Tahua (A),  Aruku-kurenga (B),  Mamari (C),  and  Keiti  (E)  tablets,  are 
apparently authentic  rongorongo contents (Fischer, 1997), however this point is still contentious 
(Guy, 1985), though Barthel (1958) believes they should not be completely disregarded.  
Given their sample-size, between N(2056) and N(5522) it may be possible to rule them out as any 
of the genres represented in the first group.  The hierarchical cluster plot shows that the RR texts are 
related to the category prose.  There exists a correlation between the inclusion of these texts in the 
prose category, and their large sample-size, which fits more with a prose text, than a chant or song 
(typically between 50-200 words).  In addition, Maunsell (cf. Grey, 1853:xiii-xiv), notes that prose 
was very different and adhered more to the grammar of Maori than poetry, songs, or chants, which 
have different grammatical structures.  This observation is supported by the hierarchical cluster plot 
where prose is separated from the first main group of 'public address'.   
However, the meta-data related to the classification of the language corpus (according to key-words 
in  the  title),  may  over  generalise  and  could  therefore  be  unreliable,  despite  the  apparent 
correspondence between the genres.  Without assistance from a native Maori speaker, caution is 
needed until the text-categories are properly validated.   
Based on the results of the  rongorongo and language corpus, it would be difficult to argue for a 
successful classification given that rongorongo is still undeciphered, and the issues associated with 
polysemy in the language corpora need to  be properly addressed.   Consequently,  an additional 
corpus is introduced, containing 43 Egyptian Hieroglyphic texts collected from Rosmorduc (1997). 
77
This will allow the methods applied above, to be validated properly.
The genre of one group of texts is known, and are classified as teachings. The corpus consists of 28 
texts: 27 of the  Teachings of Amenemope, and a further teaching text, Kagemni.  If all the texts are 
similar in terms of their contents, this will become apparent from a LSA, and resulting hierarchical 
clustering procedures.  The analysis will also replicate the condition of the rongorongo corpus, as 
the Egyptian texts are transliterated in much the same way.  The genre of the remaining texts is 
unknown, but they generally represent texts collected from coffin and stela inscriptions.
Figure 24 presents the results.  Texts AM001 to AM027 represent the Teachings of Amenemope, and 
KAG001 the Kagemni teachings text.  There are two categories of text:  One group is divided into 
two sub-groups with the majority of the Amenemope texts clustered together at the top of the chart. 
Six of the  Amenemope texts show less correlation with this group and are instead part of other 
clusters.  Four of the  Amenemope texts (AM003, AM004, AM012, and AM014), appear with the 
Kagemni (KAG001)  text,  showing  some relationship  with  the  main  Teachings  of  Amenemope,  
forming an additional sub-group, including 7 other texts, (see below figure 22).

Figure 23. Dendrogram of Egyptian Hieroglyphic texts categorised by literary-genre.
The remaining group, appearing at the bottom of the chart, (headed by text SHT001), contains two 
of  the  Amenemope texts  (AM002,  and AM027),  showing a  departure  from the main  teachings  
group.  This might, again, be a result of over-generalisation or pre-processing issues. However, for 
the  purposes  of  this  study,  the  categorisation  has  been  quite  successful,  with  the  bulk  of  the 
Amenemope texts  clustered  together,  and  a  secondary group containing  the  remaining  teaching 
texts.  
5.7.2 Term-term similarity analysis
The same LSA methods applied to text classification, may be applied to the glyphs and morphemes 
themselves.  To demonstrate, a term-to-term similarity analysis was performed on a chosen glyph. 
The Egyptian texts were selected again, as the values of the glyphs are known and results based on 
the 'known' highlight the accuracy of the method better than those based on the 'unknown' i.e. the 
79
rongorongo corpus.  In addition, attributing significance to one glyph or group of glyphs in the 
rongorongo corpus would require an entire new study in itself, and substantial statistical support.  
In Egyptian, glyph <A1> depicts a 'seated man', and acts as a determiner meaning 'I' or 'me', but 
also as a semantic classifier when attached to glyphs; denoting actions, occupations, relationships, 
and personal names (Gardiner, 2005:442), see figure 24 for examples.  Glyph <A1> should be quite 
productive in the corpus, making it a good candidate for analysis.

b.)
c.)
Figure 24. Examples of glyph <A1>13
Above, glyph <A1> stands before the verb 'be silent' (Faulkner, 1988:290), forming the noun 'silent 
man' (24.a), in the second example (24.b), it acts as a determiner denoting an occupation, 'scribe' 
(Faulkner,1988:246), and in the final example (24.c), glyph <A1> is a determiner for son (Faulkner, 
1988:207), as in 'his son', and also at the end of the passage denoting the plural of the compound 
'king's children', (Faulkner, 1988:116).
Glyph <A1> is highly productive over a large set of texts (table 15), which means we can proceed 
with the analysis, as there seems to be enough instances of glyph <A1> for the LSA to make good 
predictions of its relationship with other glyphs in the corpus.   
13.  These examples are generated in LaTex with the Sesh package by Serge Rosmorduc (1997).

Table 15. Top 20 Frequency count of Glyph <A1> in descending order.
The  glyphs  meeting  the  >=0.7  threshold  are  once  again  returned,  (as  per  Landauer  et  al., 
2004:5217).  A KWIC concordance is generated to validate the results of the LSA.  Due to the large 
number of instances, the results have been summarised by selecting the most correlated-glyphs, 
with a count of their position relative to the node <A1> (see table 16).  The second to last column 
shows the total number of instances of each correlated-glyph, and the last column, their correlation 
to glyph <A1>.
Table 16. Summary of the KWIC concordance and LSA results.
The KWIC concordance show that there are examples of glyph <A1> forming a relationship with 
the glyphs identified by the LSA (i.e. <V31A>, <A2>, <D54>, <G41>, <N23>, and <gm>).  There 
are however, a few concerns in relation to the correlation of 0.91 assigned to glyph <U19> an 'adze', 
or variant of the preposition <n> (Gardiner, 2005:518).  There are no instances of it in the KWIC 
concordances.  A further analysis reveals that glyph <U19> is assigned this value due to it appearing 
in proximity to the other glyphs associated with glyph <A1> (table 17).

Table 17. KWIC concordance of <U19>.
The correlation of 0.84 between glyph <nw> and <A1>, is explained by the KWIC concordance. 
Glyph <U19> appears mainly in combination with glyph <n> and <nw>.  On closer examination, 
glyph <U19> combined with <n> and <nw> (actually glyph <N35> and <W24> respectively), 
forms the demonstrative 'this', (Gardiner, 2005:518).  In addition, the other glyphs associated with 
<A1> occur with glyph <U19> as shown by the summary (table 18).  A few previously observed 
glyphs, for example: <A2>, <D64>, <G41>, <mw>, and <N23>, are also returned in the results.  
Table 18. Summary of KWIC results for glyph <U19>.
What  must  be  considered,  is  that  LSA identifies  the  similarity  between  glyphs  by  looking  at 
examples of collocations, as well as the clause and paragraph as a whole.  LSA does this for all texts 
and glyphs in the corpus.  Consequently, if a glyph has a small correlation (see <N36> at 0.72, in 
table 16), this maybe due to it being associated with many glyphs in the same domain (i.e. as a 
determiner or phonetic complement).  This is suggested by the plot of the term-to-term similarity 
scores (correlation), see figure 25, below.

Figure 25. Plot of glyph <N36>
The long flat line at the top of the graph shows that this glyph is equally correlated with many other 
glyphs, at approx 0.92.  Therefore this glyph is less correlated with glyph <A1> because it is more 
productive, and less likely to favour a particular glyph.
Therefore, the strong correlation between glyphs is attributed to those that form collocations, or 
where there is a semantic dependency.  To illustrate, glyph <N36> and <N23> form compounds, 
including:  /mrt/  'weaver',  /mr/  'friend',  which  includes  glyph  <A1>  as  determiner  (Gardiner, 
2005:491).  In addition, <G41> forms the sequence <A1-N35-G41-G54> meaning 'alight, or 'halt', 
and <G17-D36-X1-N35-T14-G41-A1>, as 'nomad hunter' (Gardiner, 2005:472), which explains to 
some degree its positive correlation with <A1>.  Therefore, many of the glyphs retrieved by the 
LSA have some function associated with glyph <A1>, either as a determiner, phonetic complement, 
or logogram.  
In conclusion, the results show that the methods used here have elicited some form of literary genre 
based on the features peculiar to each text; whether it is from data containing glyphs or morphemes. 
Some of these results, for example, the factor analysis provide a good starting point for exploratory 
studies, but there are issues related to the number, and type of features selected.  Traditional corpus 
linguistic techniques (counts of n-grams, and KWIC concordances) offer more precision in terms of 
identifying which glyphs and morphemes form some lexical  or grammatical  association pattern 
(Biber et al., 1998).  However, it is often time consuming to filter through the data looking for these 
patterns.  Latent semantic analysis (LSA) produces results which are easier to interpret, and shows 
83
the  strength  of  correlation  between  terms.   One  disadvantage,  is  that  LSA is  computationally 
expensive when applied to large corpora, however for this study it is capable of processing the 
whole  rongorongo  corpus without any problems.  To summarise, future  rongorongo  studies may 
wish to consider adopting LSA as part of a mixed-methods approach, when exploring the semantics 
of the rongorongo corpus. 
84
Chapter 6 Conclusion and Recommendations for further research
6.1 Conclusion
The analysis of the  rongorongo corpus appears to require a mixed-methods approach borrowing 
from  corpus  linguistics;  including  word-frequency  distribution  analysis,  collocations,  KWIC 
concordances  (see  Biber  et  al.,  1998;  Gries,  2009;  Baayen,  2008);  lexicostatistics  involving 
spectrum frequencies  and Vocabulary Growth  Curves  (Baroni,  and Evert,  2006;  Baayen,  2001; 
2008),  combined with  authorship-attribution studies  (see  Mosteller  and Wallace,  1964;  Baayen, 
2008;  Stamatatos  et  al.,  2009).   These  studies  have  been  successful  in  classifying  unknown 
authorship against  a list  of known texts; one example being the study of the 'Federalist papers' 
(Mosteller and Wallace, 1964).  However, despite rigorous feature-selection criteria the choice of 
the number of features is still left to the judgement of the researcher.  Consequently, one of the most 
attractive properties of applying LSA is that it requires high dimensional data-sets representative of 
'global knowledge' (Landauer, et al., 1997). 
An understanding of the structural features, context, or genre of the  rongorongo texts will provide 
an insight into the use of glyphs and is therefore paramount in revealing the underlying mechanisms 
that were exploited for  creating inscriptions with such allographic diversity, yet a relative amount 
of standardisation (Horley, 2005; 2007a; 2009).  
Tests for lexical-richness hints at the nature of a text.   The correlation between texts with large 
numbers  of  delimiters  (Horley,  2007a)  and  those  without,  show  that  these  list-like  texts  are 
lexically-richer and more likely to be lists of content-words, due to their low occurrence - typically 
among the  hapax-legomena.  Analysing Vocabulary Growth Curves (VGC) provides some insight 
into how the texts can be segmented, in order to compensate for any skew in statistical measures, 
caused by the presence of possible sub-texts.
The most successful of the multivariate methods would appear to be Latent semantic analysis as a 
result of the underlying the model, which are not dependant on frequency data in the same way 
other analyses are prone (factor analysis, relative frequency counts).  Each form of analysis has its 
advantages and shortcomings, however they all reveal a small piece of the puzzle, or a different 
view of the data.  Each method is used to validate the results of previous methods, or provide model 
versions of raw data.  
85
The  groupings  of  tablets  would  appear  to  be  broadly divided  into  two  main  groups  with  one 
designated 'prose', and the other 'lists' of personal names, places, dates or other possible inventory 
style items.  These terms are applied generally however, and do not represent a final hypothesis 
concerning the literary-genre of the tablets, merely that they share a common theme or contents 
denoted by the strength of their correlation.  However, it does provide statistical support for the 
conclusions drawn by previous studies, (Barthel,  1958; Butinov and Knorozov, 1957; Fedorova, 
1978; Guy, 1982; 1985; 1990; 2006; Fischer, 1997; Davletshin, 2002; Horley, 2005; 2007a; 2007b; 
Pozdniakov, 1996; Pozdniakov and Pozdniakov, 2007; Melka 2008; 2009b; 2010).   If these groups 
show that structural variation is restricted to a specific group of tablets, then it may be concluded 
that  this  is  as  a  result  of  literary-genre,  or  that  they are  attributed to  different  scribal  schools, 
(Routledge, 1919); resulting in the identification of the mechanisms behind the alloglyphs obvious 
from parallel-passages.
In addition, the language corpus provided some evidence for the application of VGCs as a possible 
tool for segmentation.  The LSA shows the presence of sub-groups, and how they are related to a 
broader category of 'chant' or 'public address', and 'prose'.  Although more work would need to be 
done, a comparative analysis of rongorongo and Rapanui oral tradition is expected to identify some 
fragment or passage of text that  reflects the structures assigned to the glyphs,  which reviewing 
previous research (Barthel, 1958; Fedorova, 1978; Davletshin, 2002; Horley, 2007a; Pozdniakov, 
and Pozdniakov, 2007; Melka, 2010), 'would seem entirely justified', (Fischer, 1997: 304).  Fischer 
(1997:305) proposes however, that language texts used in comparative structural analysis should 
rely on premissionary texts  before 1866 as they are  the most  likely to parallel  the  rongorongo 
inscriptions.  As the majority of texts in the language corpus of this study date before 1853, some 
being  of  ancient  origin  (particularly  Grey,  1853),  it  is  hoped  that  proper  pre-processing  and 
segmentation will improve the current results.
The study evaluated a series of alternative data-sets.  For the moment most scholars agree that 
Barthel's  (1958)  corpus  is  sufficient,  though  Guy  (1985;  1990;  2006)  highlights  a  number  of 
inconsistencies, and both Horley, (2007a) and Pozdniakov and Pozdniakov (2007) choose to pre-
process the Barthel (1958) corpus, removing particular alpha-codes.  More importantly, there is no 
current alternative,  although Horley (2005) proposes a new scheme based on the compositional 
elements of the glyphs, reducing the sign list to 50 elementary signs.
86
For statistical purposes it appears that DD4 provides better results, as it identifies all instances of a 
glyph in the corpus, simplifying the programming. The argument whether a glyph like 700 (fish) is 
the same as 700y (an upside down fish), will be revealed once further steps have been taken towards 
the decipherment.   It is possible to remove many of the (Barthel, 1958) alpha-codes, though 'f' 
representing 'feathered' glyphs (i.e. those with a series of lines emanating from their contour), are 
problematic (Paul Horley, 2010, personal communication).
To summarise,  this  paper  has attempted to  solve one a problem in  rongorongo studies,  that  of 
literary genre.  Once it is established which tablets are likely to contain similar inscriptions, it will 
provide some contextualisation to the study of the glyphs and the motivation for their presence on 
specific tablets.  
Lastly, this paper has benefited from the application of the R programming language for statistics, 
which provides numerous functions that can be incorporated into programs and applied to corpora. 
In addition, being free, there are no research costs compared to packages such as SPSS, where an 
annual license fee is required.  It is hoped therefore that this paper also shows what applied-linguists 
can  achieve  with a  little  computer  programming knowledge (see  Biber  et  al.,  1998;  Evert  and 
Baroni, 2006; Baayen, 2008; Johnson, 2008; Gries, 2009; Wild, 2009 for more on these methods).
6.2  Further research
From  the  correspondence  analysis,  we  see  that  preprocessing  of  the  texts  and  tagging  of 
grammatical constructions; such as the dative, active, and passive, would be beneficial to the study. 
In addition, the  rongorongo corpus needs further segmentation based on entropy (Rao, R., et al., 
2009),  or  on  the  constant  proposed  by  Golcher  (2007),  which  segments  morphemes  using 
unsupervised, and language independent, methods based on word frequency counts of substrings 
(character level n-grams, see Golcher, 2007:1). The underlying assumption is that a larger unit is 
composed of smaller units commonly occurring together.  Consequently, the segmentation of text is 
made where the predictability of the following character falls, (Golcher, 2007:2).   
The level of orthography is still undetermined for rongorongo.  Calculating the sample correlation-
coefficients for Chinese texts and glyphs, Penn (2006) demonstrates how the degree of logography 
and phonography can be determined by a 3D pairs plot.  The level of logography and phonography 
present in a particular writing system, can be used as a tool to 'classify entirely unknown writing 
87
systems to assist in attempts at archaeological decipherment' (Penn, 2006:1).  Addressing this issue 
through  an  analysis  of  Chinese  Hànzi and  English,  by  calculating  the  sample  correlation-
coefficients of a corpus of text based on a similar term-document matrix used in LSA.  Although still 
in its  early stages,  this  would appear to be a promising method for assessing the next issue in 
rongorongo research, the Orthographically Relevant Level (ORL), (Sproat, 2000).  
Is rongorongo syllabic, logographic, or a mixture of the two, plus semantic categories and phonetic 
complements?   The  perspective  plots  (figure  26)  show  a  3D  pairs  plot  with  the  strength  of 
correlation between glyphs represented by the height of each peak for Egyptian (as per previous 
LSA), Cuneiform (35 texts from the  Laws of Hammurabi),  rongorongo,  and a number of English 
texts (Alice in wonderland, Huckleberry Finn, Dracula, Pride and Prejudice, and Sherlock Holmes, 
to name a few, 46 in total).  
There does seem to be a difference between a writing system like Egyptian and Cuneiform, versus 
English  and  rongorongo.   A logographic  writing  system may display  properties  similar  to  the 
Egyptian plot where glyphs are used for a specific text i.e. a funerary formula, which will mean less 
'semantic clumpiness' (see Penn, 2006:2), shown by the absence of any peaks in the rest of the 
Egyptian plot.  However, the depth of the chart shows that there are quite a few similarities in the 
usage of glyphs (i.e. syntax particles or phonetic and semantic classifiers).  The plot for Cuneiform, 
on the other hand, shows there is more correlation between the individual constituents, shown by 
the depth of the correlation (filling the whole 3D cube), this however may be due to the repeated 
formula in the  Laws of Hammurabi,  i.e.  ‘If a man does X, to Y, he will receive Z punishment’, 
causing each section to be quite similar in structure, and they are also considered to be one text 
genre (list of laws).  English and rongorongo show an interesting parallel between the distribution 
of the peaks,  though the depth of the plot  is  slightly deeper for English,  showing more of the 
documents share common vocabulary.

These are only preliminary results and more comparisons need to be made between writing systems 
of the world, both modern and ancient.  However, it is obvious from these plots that there is an 
interesting difference between these scripts, but whether this difference is quantifiable, and shown 
to  assign  the  correct  ORL, needs  to  be  determined  by  a  more  extensive  study.  In  particular, 
parameters for the representativeness and size of the corpora and transliteration schemes need to be 
assessed in order to ensure that results are consistent, and do not lead to incorrect assumptions.  
Returning to the previous discussion,  LSA can be applied to glyphs to quantify glyph behaviour, 
89
though it  requires more testing,  as this  paper may be the first  to apply  LSA to  ancient writing 
systems and decipherment.  However, the study shows that by following the semantic correlation 
between glyphs, it is possible to adopt a hierarchical approach similar to syntax trees and the notion 
of  binding  to  discover  which  glyphs  'govern'  others  (Chomsky,  1981a),  and  which  reveal  an 
anaphoric relationship to other glyphs in the corpus.   
Markov models used in Natural Language Processing, speech recognition, and work on deciphering 
the Indus Valley script (see Rao et al., 2009) would produce model glyph collocations, or predict the 
value of damaged glyphs and the semantic relationships that may exist had the corpus of surviving 
inscriptions been larger.  In addition, cryptographic methods such as the transposition cypher, can 
be trained with the same data presented in this paper i.e., counts of features, correlations, typical 
collocations, and KWIC concordance data.  This method can produce statistically based guesses of 
glyph values, which although likely to generate incorrect strings, may provide correct 'guesses' or 
some avenues for further study. 
A final remark is that each study submitted to the ever growing pool of research on rongorongo and 
writing systems, is a valid contribution, and when supplemented with statistical analysis as part of a 
mixed-methods approach, will result in more robust conclusions.   Corpus linguistic methods offer a 
good basis on which to build more advance approaches using language modelling techniques, or to 
provide support to palaeographic analysis.  It is hoped that with the recent increase in the pace of 
rongorongo research (Horley, 2009; 2010; Melka, 2009a; 2009b; 2010; Wieczorek, 2010), that we 
will see a decipherment in the not too distant future.
