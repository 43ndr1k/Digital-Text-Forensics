Abstract
The research reported in this paper is part of a larger
project on the classification of Web pages by genre. Such
classification is a potentially powerful tool in filtering the
results of online searches. In this paper, we describe two
sets of experiments investigating the automatic classification
of Web pages by their genres. In these experiments, our
approach is to represent the Web pages by profiles that are
composed of fixed-length byte n-grams.
The first set of experiments in this study examines the
effect of three feature selection measures on the accuracy
of Web page classification. The second set of experiments in
this study compares the classification accuracy of three clas-
sification methods, each using n-gram representations of the
Web pages. The classification methods which are compared
are a distance function approach, the k-nearest neighbors
method, and the support vector machine approach. We also
examine a range of n-gram lengths and a range of Web page
profile sizes to determine what combination(s) of n-gram
length and profile size give the best classification accuracy.
Each set of experiments is run on two well-known data
sets, 7-Genre and KI-04, for which published results are
available.
1. Introduction
The research reported in this paper focuses on the au-
tomatic classification of Web pages by their genres, using
n-gram representations of the Web pages. Categorizing Web
pages by genre can allow a user to specify the genre that is of
interest with regard to a particular query, therefore Web page
genre classification is a potentially powerful tool in filtering
the results of online searches. For example, depending on the
query, the user may be interested in viewing only shopping
pages or only news articles, and in filtering out all other
Web page genres.
The representations of Web pages used in the genre
classification task are typically based on those used in
text classifications, although the representations may be
augmented with information unique to Web pages, such as
HTML tags or URL information [1]–[3]. Based on previous
research using n-gram representations of Web pages [4],
the research discussed in this paper uses n-gram Web page
representations that are formed entirely from the textual
content of each Web page, after HTML tags and JavaScript
information have been removed from the pages. These n-
grams can be thought of as the contents of a fixed-size slid-
ing window moved through the text. Byte n-grams are raw
character n-grams in which no bytes are ignored, including
the whitespace characters, whereas character n-grams use
letters only, and usually ignore all digits, punctuation, and
whitespace.
The goals of the research in this study are threefold.
First, we compare and assess the effectiveness of three
feature selection measures in choosing the n-grams with
which to represent the Web pages. The feature selection
measures to be tested are frequency, the Chi-square statistic,
and Information Gain. Second, we compare and assess the
effectiveness of three classification models. These models
include a distance function approach, the k-nearest neighbors
(k-NN) method, and the support vector machine (SVM)
approach. Finally, we examine a range of n-gram lengths,
from 2 to 10, and a range of Web page profile sizes, from
5 to 50, to determine what combination(s) of n-gram length
and profile size give the best classification accuracy. We run
our experiments on the popular 7-Genre and KI-04 data sets.
The remainder of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2
gives a brief overview of related work, while Section 3
briefly describes the three classification models to be tested,
discusses the feature selection measures to be investigated,
and provides details about the data sets and experiments.
Section 4 focuses on presenting and analyzing the results
of the experiments, while Section 5 summarizes our conclu-
sions and describes the direction of our future work.
2. Related Work
As discussed in Section 1, Web pages can be represented
much like documents in text classification, however the Web
page representations may also include information, such as
URL information, which is not found in typical text docu-
ments. Lee and Myaeng [5] represent Web pages using terms
from a genre-specific core vocabulary, whereas Rehm [6]
combines linguistic features with both HTML meta data and
presentation related tags. Meyer zu Eissen and Stein [1] use
a combination of genre-specific vocabulary and closed-class
word sets with text statistics, part-of-speech information, and
HTML tags, while Boese and Howe [2] augment a bag of
words representation with other information that includes
HTML tags and URL information. Chaker and Habib [7]
combine two centroid-based classifiers, one of which uses
structural information from the document, while the other
uses URL information. Santini [8] uses feature sets that
include HTML tags, part-of-speech tags, and genre-specific
facets. See Stein and Meyer zu Eissen [3] for a chronological
overview of the document representations used for genre
classification on Web-based corpora.
The research discussed in this paper represents Web pages
using byte n-grams. The use of n-grams has been common in
language modeling since at least 1948 when Claude Shannon
investigated the question of determining the likelihood of the
next letter in a given sequence of characters [9]. Since that
time, n-grams have been widely used in natural language
processing and statistical analysis. For example, Cavnar and
Trenkle [10] use n-gram representations of documents for
text classification, as do Kešelj et al. [11] in their work on
authorship attribution.
Once the type of representation for the Web page has been
determined, it is often necessary to select a subset of features
in order to reduce the dimensionality of the search space, and
thus reduce the computational complexity of the problem.
Yang and Pedersen [12] provide a comparative study of the
traditional feature selection techniques in text classification.
Yang and Pedersen evaluated five feature selection measures:
term selection based on document frequency, Information
Gain, Mutual Information, the Chi-square test, and Term
Strength. In their experiments, they found that Information
Gain and the Chi-square test were the most effective mea-
sures for feature selection. Focusing specifically on the clas-
sification of Web pages by genre, Dong et al. [13] evaluated
three measures for feature selection. They compared the
performance of Information Gain, Mutual Information, and
the Chi-square statistic for selecting features for the binary
classification of Web page genres. They found that although
all three selection measures were capable of detecting small
sets of discriminating features, when feature sets were as
small as 5, only Information Gain and the Chi-square statis-
tic were able to successfully select features that gave good
performance. Houvardas and Stamatatos [14], working on
the problem of authorship attribution, proposed a selection
technique for variable-length character n-grams in which
each n-gram is compared with similar n-grams (either longer
or shorter) in the feature set and the most important of them
is kept. Once the feature selection has been made, a support
vector machine (SVM) is then trained on this reduced feature
set, and the SVM model is applied to the test set. Their
experimental results indicated that the proposed feature
selection technique resulted in higher classification accuracy
than when Information Gain was used as a feature selection
measure. Kanaris and Stamatatos [15] applied this feature
selection technique for variable-length character n-grams
to the problem of Web page genre identification. In their
experiments, they tested two models: the first model uses
only feature sets of variable-length character n-grams from
the textual content of each Web page, whereas the second
model augments the first model with structural information
about the most frequent HTML tags. Each Web page is
represented by a vector of the HTML tag frequencies; the
ReliefF feature selection algorithm [16] is then applied to
reduce the dimensionality of the vectors. As with Houvardas
and Stamatatos [14], after the feature sets are reduced,
classification is performed using an SVM.
In this paper, we investigate the use of frequency, Infor-
mation Gain, and the Chi-square statistic as feature selection
techniques, and then compare the performance of three
classification models, namely a distance function approach
similar to that used by Kešelj et al. [11], the well-known
k-NN method, and the popular SVM approach favored by,
for example, Meyer zu Eissen and Stein [1], Santini [8], and
Kanaris and Stamatatos [15].
3. Methodology
Previous research on the use of n-gram representations of
Web pages and Web page genres indicates that when using
small Web page profile sizes, it is beneficial to preprocess
the Web pages by removing the HTML tags and Javascript
information [4]. For this reason, the experiments for this
paper are conducted using Web pages that have had the
HTML tags and JavaScript code removed as a preprocessing
step. The remaining textual content of each Web page is then
used to form a byte n-gram representation of the Web page.
No stemming of terms or stopword removal is performed.
Each data set is partitioned into a training and test set.
For the Web page in the test set, profile are constructed
that consist of the L top ranked fixed-length byte n-grams
and their normalized frequencies, Chi-square statistics, or
Information Gain values, depending on the feature selection
measure being used. The initial n-gram profiles are produced
using the Perl package Text:Ngrams1. The byte n-grams
are raw character n-grams in which no bytes are ignored, in-
cluding the whitespace characters, thus some of the structure
of a document is captured using byte n-grams.
3.1. Classification Models
For the distance function classification model tested in
this study, each Web page genre is represented by a profile
that is constructed by combining the n-gram profiles for each
exemplar Web page of that genre, forming a centroid profile
for each Web page genre [17]. Each Web page profile from
1. http://users.cs.dal.ca/∼vlado/srcperl/Ngrams/
the test set is compared with each centroid genre profile from
the training set. The Web page is assigned the label of the
Web page genre profile to which its profile is closest (most
similar), according to a distance measure. Based on extensive
experimentation with a variety of distance functions, we
compute the distance between two n-gram profiles using
the formula suggested by Kešelj et al. [11]. The distance
(dissimilarity) between two profiles is defined as
d (P1, P2) =
∑
m∈(P1∪P2)
(
2 · (f1 (m)− f2 (m))
f1 (m) + f2 (m)
)2
, (1)
where f1(m) and f2(m) are the frequencies of n-gram m in
the profiles P1 and P2 respectively.
The second classification model tested in this study is the
k-NN approach. The k-NN classification algorithm is one of
the simplest and best known machine learning algorithms,
in which a document is classified based on the majority
vote of its neighbors, with the document being assigned to
the most common class amongst its k nearest neighbors,
where k is a positive integer. The experiments with the k-
NN model were run using k = 1, k = 3, and k = 5, for
both the Euclidean and the Manhattan distance measures.
Using k = 1 produced the best classification results with
each distance measure, and using the Euclidean distance
measure gave the better classification results than using the
Manhattan distance, therefore the results given for the k-NN
model are for the case in which k = 1 and the Euclidean
distance measure is used.
The final classification model tested in this study is the
SVM method. The SVM method is a popular and well-
known supervised machine learning method which performs
classification by constructing an N -dimensional hyperplane
that optimally separates the data. The vectors near the
hyperplane are the support vectors. For the experiments
using the SVM method in this paper, the sequential minimal
optimization (SMO) method is used to find the separating
hyperplane.
3.2. Feature Selection Measures
Although we have achieved excellent classification ac-
curacy in Web page genre classification experiments using
frequency as a feature selection method [17], our hypothesis
is that a more theoretically sound feature selection measure
could be more effective. Thus, we investigate not only
frequency, but also the Chi-square statistic and Information
Gain as feature selection measures. The Chi-square statistic
is a statistically based measure, while Information Gain is
probability based. See, for example, Yang and Pedersen [12]
for further details.
3.3. Data Sets
For the experiments reported in this paper, we use two
established data sets for which published results are avail-
able. These data sets, known as the 7-Genre and KI-04 data
sets, are available online2. In each case, the unit of analysis
is the individual Web page, and each Web page is labeled
with one, and only one, genre label.
The 7-Genre data set, constructed by Marina Santini
and described in Santini [8], contains 1400 English Web
pages, and is evenly balanced with 200 Web pages in each
of seven genres. These genres are BLOG, ESHOP, FAQ,
ONLINE NEWSPAPER FRONT PAGE, LISTING, PERSONAL
HOME PAGE, and SEARCH PAGE. The granularity of the
collection is consistent, with the exception of the LISTING
genre, which can be decomposed into the subgenres CHECK-
LIST, HOTLIST, SITEMAP, and TABLE.
The KI-04 data set, constructed by Meyer zu Eissen and
Stein [1] has eight genres suggested by participants in a user
study on the usefulness of Web page genres. The original
corpus includes some empty Web pages, and so we follow
the lead of Santini [8] and Chaker and Habib [7] in using
the 1205 non-empty pages. The number of Web pages per
genre ranges from 126 to 205; see Table 1 for details of the
distribution of the genres. The Web pages in this data set
include supplementary tagged information, such as the title,
genre, and a plain text summary. All of this supplementary
information was removed prior to processing.

3.4. Experiments
The experiments reported in this paper are performed
on the 7-Genre and KI-04 data sets, using 10-fold cross
validation in each case. This helps provide robustness against
2. http://www.itri.brighton.ac.uk/∼Marina.Santini/#Download
overfitting and gives additional strength to the statistical
analysis. We use classification accuracy as the evaluation
metric. This metric can be defined in terms of true positives,
in which for each genre, a true positive, Tp, is a Web page
that the classifier correctly labels as being of that genre. For
the experiments in this paper, each Web page has one, and
only one, genre label. In this case, classification accuracy
can be defined as
accuracy =
|G|∑
i=1
Tp
|N | , (2)
where |G| is the number of genres and |N | is the number
of Web pages. Because we perform 10-fold cross validation
for each experiment, our results for each experiment are a
micro-average of the classification accuracy.
The objective of the first set of experiments is to in-
vestigate the effect of three feature selection measures:
frequency, the Chi-square statistic, and Information Gain.
The objective of the second set of experiments is to compare
the performance of three classification models: the distance
function approach, the k-nearest neighbors method, and the
support vector machine approach. We also examine a range
of n-gram lengths, from 2 to 10, and a range of Web page
profile sizes, from 5 to 50, to determine what combination(s)
of n-gram length, and profile size give the best classification
accuracy. Each set of experiments is run on the two well-
known data sets described in Section 3.3, the 7-Genre data
set and the KI-04 data set.
Each experiment uses fixed-length byte n-grams to repre-
sent each Web page and Web page genre, however we vary
the length of the n-gram from 2 to 10. For each n-gram
length, the number of n-grams used to create the Web page
profiles is varied from 5 to 50, in increments of 5.
4. Results and Discussion
The results of these experiments are reported in Tables 2–
5 and Figures 1 and 2. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests
were performed to determine the effect on classification
accuracy of the feature selection measure, the classification
model, the n-gram length, the Web Page profile size, and the
combination of these parameters. A summary of the results
follows.
4.1. Feature Selection Results
As shown in Table 2, each of the feature selection
measures allows the Web page genre classification model
to achieve a high mean classification accuracy for n-grams
of length 2 to 10 and profile sizes of 5 to 50. However, using
the Chi-square statistic as a feature selection measure gives
the best performance on each of the data sets, achieving
high accuracy with Web page profiles as small as 5. An
ANOVA test shows that this performance is significantly
better than using either frequency or Information Gain as
feature selection measures (p < 0.001). For this reason, the
remainder of our discussion of the results focuses on the use
of the Chi-square statistic as the feature selection measure.

*Significantly greater (p < 0.001) than either Information Gain or
Frequency for both 7-Genre and KI-04 data sets.
4.2. Classification Model Results
As shown in Table 3, each of the classification models
tested achieves a high mean classification accuracy for n-
grams of length 2 to 10 and profile sizes of 5 to 50. The
SVM classifier is significantly better than the k-NN classifier
on both the 7-Genre and KI-04 data sets (p < 0.001 in each
case). The SVM classifier also performs significantly better
than the distance function classifier on the KI-04 data set
(p < 0.001). The distance function classifier gives a higher
mean accuracy on the 7-Genre data set than does the SVM
classifier; although the difference is statistically significant
(p = 0.005), the mean difference of 0.002 on this data set
is much smaller than the mean difference of 0.011 between
these two classifiers on the KI-04 data set. Note that the
Chi-square statistic is the feature selection measure for each
of the classification models.
4.2.1. Effect of n-gram Length. In these experiments, the
n-gram length ranges from 2 to 10 in increments of 1.
There is a significant impact on the classification accuracy
depending on which n-gram length is used; this effect on the
accuracy for each data set is significant at p < 0.001. The
partial Eta squared for the n-gram length is 0.538 for the
7-Genre data set and 0.033 for the KI-04 data set. These
results indicate that the proportion of total variability in
the classification accuracy for the 7-Genre data set is quite
highly influenced by the n-gram length. The partial Eta
squared is much lower for the KI-04 data set, but as the

averaged over n-gram lengths of 2 to 10 and Web page
profile sizes of 5 to 50. Standard error in parenthesis.

Distance Function 0.974 (< 0.001) 0.982 (0.001)
accuracy rate approaches 100%, which it does with this data
set, we could expect a ceiling effect for any variance overlap.
Figures 1(a) and 1(b) compare the mean classification ac-
curacy for the k-NN, SVM, and distance function classifica-
tion models on the 7-Genre and KI-04 data sets respectively.
In these figures, the classification accuracy is averaged over
Web page profile sizes of 5 to 50 for each n-gram length
from 2 to 10. The general observable trend is that as n-
gram size increases, the mean accuracy tends to decrease.
However, even at the lowest mean classification accuracies
shown are relatively high, illustrating the soundness of the
Chi-square statistic as a feature selection measure, as well
as the robustness of all three classification models.
4.2.2. Effect of Web Page Profile Size. In these ex-
periments, the Web page profile size ranges from 5 to
50 in increments of 5. The effect of profile size on the
classification accuracy for each data set is significant at
p = 0.001. The partial Eta squared for the Web page profile
size is 0.052 for the 7-Genre data set and 0.011 for the KI-04
data set. These results indicate that the proportion of total
variability in the classification accuracy for either data set,
although significant, is only mildly influenced by the profile
size.
Figures 2(a) and 2(b) compare the mean classification
accuracy for the k-NN, SVM, and distance function clas-
sification models on the 7-Genre and KI-04 data sets re-
spectively. In these figures, the classification accuracy is
averaged over n-gram lengths from 2 to 10 for each Web
page profile size from 5 to 50. For the k-NN model, the mean
classification accuracy decreases as the Web page profile
size increases. This is also true of the SVM model when
the Web page profile size exceeds 15. The distance function
model performs less well with Web page profile sizes below
15, however, as was observed with Figures 1(a) and 1(b),
all of the classification accuracies shown in the figures are
relatively high, testifying to the robustness of each of the
three classification models.
4.3. Best Results
For the 7-Genre data set, the best classification accuracy
reached by any of the three classification models tested in
these experiments is 0.998. This accuracy was achieved by
the SVM classification model, using n-grams of length 2
with a Web page profile size of 20. For the KI-04 data set,
the SVM model achieved classification accuracies of 0.998
for eleven different combinations of n-gram length and Web
page profile size, however on this data set the best accuracy
of 1.00 was achieved by the distance function model, using
n-grams of length 2 with Web page profile sizes of 15 and
20. Table 4 gives a comparison of the best results for each of
these classification models with those of other researchers.
Table 5 gives the best and worst combinations of n-gram
length and Web page profile size for each classification
model, for each data set.

5. Summary and Conclusions
The research reported in this paper is part of a project on
the automatic classification of Web pages by their genres,
using n-gram representations of the Web pages. This exam-
ination of the effect on the automatic classification of Web
pages by genre has shown that the type of feature selection
method, the classification model, the n-gram length, and the
Web page profile size each have significant effects in terms
of mean classification accuracy.
We investigated the effectiveness of three feature selection
measures in choosing the n-grams with which to represent
each Web page when using a distance function classifi-
cation model. These feature selection measures included
frequency, the Chi-square statistic, and Information Gain.
Each experiment used fixed-length byte n-grams, and the
experiments varied the length of the n-gram from 2 to

10. For each n-gram length, the number of n-grams used
to create the Web page profiles was varied in increments
of 5 from 5 to 50. Based on these experiments, the Chi-
square statistic significantly outperformed the other feature
selection measures on each data set, achieving high accuracy
with Web page profiles as small as 5.
We also compared and assessed the effectiveness of a
distance function classification model with those of the k-NN
and SVM models, using the Chi-square statistic as a feature
selection measure. All three classification models achieved
high mean classification accuracy, which further supports the
use of the Chi-square statistic as a feature selection measure.
The distance function approach achieved the highest mean
accuracy on the 7-Genre data set, and the highest accuracy
on the KI-04 data set, however the SVM classification model
proved to be the most robust model when n-gram length and
Web page profile size are varied.
Finally, we examined the range of n-gram lengths, from
2 to 10, and the range of Web page profile sizes, from 5 to
50, to determine what combination(s) of n-gram length and
profile size give the best classification accuracy.
These experiments indicated that in general, short n-gram
lengths give better performance than longer n-gram lengths,
with an n-gram length of 2 being the best for both the
SVM and distance function approaches. Although the k-
NN method favors Web page profile sizes of 5, for the
SVM and distance function classification models the results
indicate that Web page profile sizes of between 10 and 40
are excellent choices, particularly when coupled with the use
of n-grams of length 2.
These experiments have illustrated the value in using n-
gram representations of Web pages for the task of classifying
Web pages by genre. We have also shown the importance of
choosing a theoretic measure, in particular the Chi-statistic,
to identify small feature sets of n-grams to represent Web
pages. The combination of n-gram Web page representations
with features sets chosen using the Chi-square statistic
gives high mean classification accuracy on each of the
classification models tested.
This research is continuing and experimentation is ongo-
ing. We recognize the need to expand our efforts to a larger
scale in which we work with more genres, noise, and varying
levels of genre granularity, as well as with multi-labeled and
unbalanced data sets.
