In the rich history of speech and language analysis in schizo-
phrenia, researchers have described the errors, structures and
meanings in the language of people with schizophrenia,1–3
focusing on particular symptoms, such as thought disorder, and
their manifestation in speech.1–3 First-person accounts are an
invaluable source for increasing empathic understanding; they
are not only used in psychiatric training, but are relevant to
garnering public awareness. Today, first-person narratives by
writers such as Elyn Saks (The Center Cannot Hold4) and Kay
Redfield Jamison (An Unquiet Mind5) have changed public
perceptions of mental illness. However, preconceptions and
interpretive frame colour how readers interpret these accounts.
Even grounded theory6 approaches, which purport to draw out
themes and meaning, are susceptible to bias, no matter how
principled. We thought it would be useful to go back to a more
fundamental question: ‘What are the words used?’
There are many ways to attempt to explain how psychotic
symptoms arise. In the present study, we tested the hypothesis
that, relative to people with mood disorders, people with schizo-
phrenia write with a particular word-use profile reflective of the
cognitive disturbances that characterise psychotic symptoms.
Cognitive neuroscience models of psychosis focus on the roles
of odd perceptual experiences.7,8 Delusions in particular result
from attempts to explain these experiences.8–11 Those attempts
involve disrupted perceptions and inappropriate causal inferences,
and are often pervaded with biases, such as external attributions –
blaming these odd experiences on outside factors such as other
people and out-groups.12 According to one such theory,
prediction errors (the mismatches between expectation and
experience that drive learning, attentional allocation and belief
formation) may be signalled inappropriately in patients with
psychosis.13 These aberrant signals drive delusion formation as a
means of explaining these odd experiences. We examined whether
the key tenets of the cognitive neuroscience frameworks
(externalising attributions, aberrant causal inferences, perceptual
disturbances) were evident in the written language of patients with
schizophrenia compared with those with mood disorder. Our
hypotheses were:
(a) H1: People with mood disorder use more first-person singular
pronouns and affect words. First, as an internal control, we
expected, based on prior published work with word
counts,14 that patients with mood disorder would be self-
focused and so would use first-person singular pronouns
(‘I’) more frequently than patients with schizophrenia.
Given that patients with mood disorder experience pre-
dominantly affective symptoms, we also predicted that they
would use words describing mood – and particularly some
negative mood states – more frequently (i.e. ‘affect’, ‘negative
emotions’, ‘sadness’ and ‘anxiety’).
(b) H2: People with schizophrenia use more external referents as
measured by function word use. Consistent with the external
attributions that people with schizophrenia tend to make,
we predicted that writers with schizophrenia would use
function words (e.g. articles, prepositions, pronouns) that
relate to external others (e.g. third-person plural pronouns,
hereon referred to as ‘they’) more frequently than patients
with mood disorder. We expected that ‘they’ would be
enriched relative to third-person singular (‘he’/‘she’),
because psychotic symptoms commonly refer to the nefarious
intentions of powerful out-groups,15 although there are of
course cases of delusions about specific individuals (e.g. the
Othello delusion – the delusion that one’s partner is being
unfaithful).16 Also, sense of self is disrupted in phenom-
enological reports from patients with schizophrenia.17 We
therefore predicted, as in H1, that writers with schizophrenia
would use ‘I’ less often than persons with mood disorder.
(c) H3: People with schizophrenia use more external referents as
measured by content word use. We expected that external
attributions would be manifest in content word use – for
example words about other humans or human-like agents
(e.g. ‘human’, ‘religion’). These predictions are grounded in

and P. R. Corlett
Background
Language use is often disrupted in patients with
schizophrenia; novel computational approaches may
provide new insights.
Aims
To test word use patterns as markers of the perceptual,
cognitive and social experiences characteristic of
schizophrenia.
Method
Word counting software was applied to first-person accounts
of schizophrenia and mood disorder.
Results
More third-person plural pronouns (‘they’) and fewer first-
person singular pronouns (‘I’) were used in schizophrenia
than mood disorder accounts. Schizophrenia accounts
included fewer words related to the body and ingestion, and
more related to religion. Perceptual and causal language
were negatively correlated in schizophrenia accounts but
positively correlated in mood disorder accounts.
Conclusions
Differences in pronouns suggest decreased self-focus or
perhaps even an understanding of self as other in
schizophrenia. Differences in how perceptual and causal
words are correlated suggest that long-held delusions
represent a decreased coupling of explanations with sensory
experience over time.

the cognitive neuroscience of psychotic symptoms, which has
demonstrated a bias towards external attributions, consistent
with corollary discharge theories of the psychopathology of
hallucinations and delusions. In those theories, patients tend
to attribute self-generated stimuli and cognitive processes
(e.g. motor predictions, inner speech) to external agents.18
We also predicted that less inward focus would manifest as
use of fewer content words related to self (e.g. the body) in
the writing of people with schizophrenia.
(d) H4: People with schizophrenia have different relationships
between perceptual and causal words than do people with
mood disorder. Early in schizophrenia, patients are over-
whelmed by odd experiences that are difficult for them to
figure out. This phase of the illness is described as delusional
mood.19,20 During delusional mood, the world takes on an
unexpected and irrepressible significance: it is pregnant with
new meaning, significance and salience (Fig. 1).11,21–23 Some
patients experience an ‘Aha!’ moment20,24,25 when a new
idea arises to explain their strange unpredictable experiences.
The crystallising delusion carries extraordinary explanatory
power, diminishing the need for patients to continue their
struggle with odd perceptions because the delusion explains
them.11,22,23,26–29
The profundity of perceptual experience in schizophrenia will
likely increase perceptual word use. We had more difficulty
predicting how use of words in the Linguistic Inquiry and Word
Count category ‘cognitive’ (tentative, certain, causal) might
change: patients overwhelmed by confusing perceptual data might
use more tentative or circumspect language (e.g. ‘perhaps’),
consistent with their uncertain state. They might also use more
causal language (‘because’, ‘therefore’, etc.) as they struggle to
figure out odd experiences.
In an exploratory analysis, we considered the relationship
between perceptual and causal word use across authors. There
were at least two possibilities:
(a) Perceptual and causal words would be positively correlated:
authors in the midst of delusional mood (Fig. 1) might use
more causal language as they seek explanations for their
aberrantly salient experiences.11,22
(b) Perceptual and causal words would be negatively correlated:
once delusions form, people might work less to explain their
aberrant experiences, as their delusions are explanatory
schema (narratives or world models) for subsequent psychotic
experiences (Fig. 1).9,30 Since the authors in our study are
publishing essays in a major psychiatric journal, they may be
past the chaotic perceptual experiences of early psychosis.
We might therefore expect a negative correlation between
perceptual and causal word counts.
Method
Text samples
First-person accounts (n= 77; 45 women, 24 men, 8 unclear)
describing the experiences of schizophrenia in the ‘First Person
Accounts’ section of the journal Schizophrenia Bulletin between
1979 and 2012 were collected. The essays were edited prior to
publication, and the authors also noted pre-submission assistance
from family, friends and mentors. Sample writers identified
themselves as having schizophrenia.
As a non-psychotic psychiatric control group, we collected
first-person accounts written by people with mood and anxiety
disorders which were published on the internet (n= 29; 19
women, 10 men), mostly on the Anxiety and Depression
Association of America (ADAA) website (n= 22/29 samples).
The editors of the ADAA website were contacted and they
confirmed that the essays were professionally edited. Sample
writers identified themselves as having depression, generalised
anxiety, panic disorder or obsessive–compulsive disorder. See
online Table DS1 for sample details.
Inclusion criteria for all essays were: originally written in
English, published after 1975, and written about first-person
experience.
Each essay was read by either S.K.F. or S.D-L. for inclusion
criteria and processing. Each essay was formatted into a single
plain text file using standard procedures, including correcting
spelling errors when the intended word was obvious. In addition,
we removed quotations longer than two sentences and citations.
We placed spaces around dashes and hyphens to separate
connected words that were together not recognised by Merriam
Webster Dictionary (www.merriam-webster.com). Linguistic
Inquiry and Word Count 2007 (LIWC)31,32 – a simple word-
counting software – assessed texts for the usage rates of particular
word categories. Essays differed in mean length: 2172.55 words
(s.e. = 156.31) in schizophrenia and 780.76 words (s.e. = 102.52)
in mood disorder essays (F(1,106) = 27.97, adjusted P= 1.1561075).
Statistics
LIWC reports the percentage of words in each of 68 categories as
a function of total words in a text file for function word and
content categories. These categories were validated during LIWC
development.32 We considered counts of both function word
categories (i.e. words that provide structure in the sentence, such
as pronouns and prepositions) and content word categories (i.e.
words that indicate topic, such as nouns, regular verbs, and some
adverbs and adjectives). One-way ANOVAs were conducted to
examine group differences across categories.32 We determined
our significance level to be P50.05 after false discovery rate

Fig. 1 Model for possible phases of delusion formation and
maintenance.
Early in the process, aberrantly salient experiences of the delusional mood provide
the impetus for delusions to form. Here, perceptual words and causal words should
be positively correlated. Once the delusional explanation is formed, patients report
a feeling of insight or an ‘Aha!’ moment in which they arrive at an explanation. Once
the explanation has been generated, it becomes a way to organise future experiences,
such that perceptual data are sculpted to fit the schema. Hence, the relationship
between causal and perceptual language will change, becoming negative.

the likelihood of Type I error.
Correlations between LIWC’s cognitive and perceptual
categories were assessed using bivariate analysis with Pearson’s
correlation coefficient (r). Two outliers (with percentages of
perceptual words more than two standard deviations above the
mean) were removed from this analysis. We determined our
significance level to be P50.05 after FDR correction (based on
pairwise comparisons between variables for cognitive mechanisms
and variables for perception, 24 possible comparisons). Significant
differences between groups in correlations were assessed using
Fisher’s r to z transformation.
Results
H1: People with mood disorder use more first-person
singular pronouns and affect words
As expected from previous research on word use in samples with
mood disorder, our mood disorder sample used ‘I’ more than
the schizophrenia sample (Fig. 2) (F(1,106) = 14.45, adjusted
P= 2.7061073). We further found that the mood disorder
group used more words to describe affect (F(1,106) = 69.32,
adjusted P= 1.18610711), negative emotion (F(1,106) = 87.45,
adjusted P= 1.89610713), sadness (F(1,106) = 28.38, adjusted
P= 1.1461075) and anxiety (F(1,106) = 82.73, adjusted
P= 3.51610713) (see online Table DS2).
H2: People with schizophrenia use more external
referents as measured by function word use
To test our hypothesis that external referents would be greater in
schizophrenia, consistent with an external attribution bias, we
examined ‘they’. As we predicted, ‘they’ was more frequent
(F(1,106) = 12.55, adjusted P= 5.9561073) in the schizophrenia
group relative to the mood disorder group (Fig. 2).
H3: People with schizophrenia use more external
referents as measured by content word use
A further test of our prediction about external attribution
concerned content word use in schizophrenia. The schizophrenia
essays did indeed use significantly more referents to external
agents, including more words describing humans (F(1,106) =
7.01, adjusted P= 0.04) (Fig. 3) and religion (F(1,106) = 8.23,
adjusted P= 0.02). Consistent with their perturbed sense of self,
patients with schizophrenia used fewer words describing the body
(F(1,106) = 11.86, adjusted P= 7.5261073) and ingestion
(F(1,106) = 11.44, adjusted P= 7.7961073).
H4: People with schizophrenia have different
relationships between perceptual and causal words
than do people with mood disorder
Next, we examined the essays for differences in perceptual and
causal language. We did not observe a significant difference in
perceptual words. However, both causal language (F(1,106) = 9.45,
adjusted P= 0.016) and tentative language (F(1,106) = 8.30, adjusted
P= 0.020) were less frequent in the schizophrenia essays than in
the mood disorder essays (Fig. 4).
We predicted that aberrant salience and subsequent causal
inference in schizophrenia13 might manifest in written language
as a correlation between perceptual and causal words. We
computed Pearson’s correlation between these two categories as
measured by LIWC. We found that causal and perceptual words
were significantly negatively correlated in the schizophrenia essays
(r=70.276, FDR adjusted P= 0.02) (Fig. 4), and significantly
positively correlated in the mood disorder essays (r= 0.524, FDR
adjusted P= 0.02). These correlations were significantly different
between the two groups (Fisher’s z-transformed r= 3.29,
P= 261074).
Post-hoc analyses
To test whether any of the differences between the two groups were
influenced by differences in essay length (as measured by word
count), we conducted a MANCOVA on the 12 variables described
earlier, with word count as a covariate. The two groups were
significantly different (Wilk’s lambda test, F(1,12) = 10.94,
P= 3.43610713). The subsequent ANCOVAs with word count as
a covariate for each variable revealed that word count significantly
altered the result only for affect (F(1,12) = 9.76, P= 0.002, partial
eta squared = 0.09). All between-group differences remained
statistically significant after FDR correction (adjusted P50.05)
for all 12 variables (details in online Table DS3).
To test whether the differences between the correlations in
causal and perceptual words for the two groups (H4) were

Discussion
We used a computerised text-analysis approach to examine word
use in schizophrenia. Our work extends previous findings in
language and psychology to suggest that psychiatric patients with
different diagnoses (psychotic illness v. mood disorder) use
language differently, not just in what they say (as marked by
content words), but in how they say it (as marked by function
words).34
Schizophrenia accounts differ in affective expression
relative to mood accounts
Function words are known to differ between individuals enough
to profile the demographics and personality of authors35 to
identify the authors behind pen names and terrorist threats36
(for a review, see Stamatatos35). Using LIWC, function word use
was found to differ in some psychiatric conditions; for example,
‘I’ is used more by people with depression than healthy controls,
indicating greater inward focus.14,37,38 Also, Junghaenel et al39
applied LIWC to language samples from 27 psychiatric and 17
control patients. In this mixed psychiatric group (which included
many patients with psychosis), there were significant differences
between groups in language describing positive emotions,
cognitive processes and relativity. Furthermore, others have
established that the relationships between the types of words used
may be different in patients with psychosis. Specifically, using
acyclic speech graphs to analyse speech from patients with schizo-
phrenia and bipolar disorder, Mota and colleagues found evidence
for verbosity and flight of thoughts in patients with mania.40 In
the present study, we replicated the higher rates of first-person
singular pronouns and negative affect word use associated with
depression in our writers with mood disorder.14,37,38
Schizophrenia accounts use more external referents
as measured by function word use relative to mood
accounts
We examined word use in writing by people with schizophrenia
and those with mood disorder to test the hypothesis that it would
accord with cognitive neuroscience models of psychopathology,
such as the prediction error model of delusions13 and the corollary
discharge theory of disturbed self-agency.18 Indeed, writers with
schizophrenia used ‘they’ significantly more than writers with
mood disorder. We suggest that this is consistent with the
externalising bias observed in cognitive neuroscience studies of
patients with schizophrenia.41 It may also reflect a shift in people
with schizophrenia towards thinking of self as other.17
Schizophrenia accounts use more external referents
as measured by content word use relative to mood
accounts
External bias was also present in the content words used by people
with schizophrenia. They wrote with significantly less self-focus
(reflected in less talk of the body and ingestion), and they used
words about external others (human agents and religion) more.
These differences might reflect a mix of explanatory inference
and coping. People with psychosis misattribute internally
generated processes (e.g. thoughts) to external sources (e.g. the
US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), angels or demons), perhaps
because of an attenuated forward model of self, generating
surprising experiences that individuals without psychosis would
normally disregard.42 Such experiences are distressing and
alienating. Religious practice and social relationships can help
patients with psychosis find a sense of community and belonging.
Schizophrenia accounts have different relationships
between perceptual and causal words than do mood
accounts
We also found that the schizophrenia essays differed significantly
from the mood disorder essays in the use of causal and tentative
words, and in the direction of correlation between perceptual
and causal words (negative in schizophrenia and positive in mood
disorders). It could be that the language used by patients with
schizophrenia reflects their phase of illness (see Fig. 1, delusional
mood and fixed delusion phases). Early aberrant experiences
require explanation,11,13,23,42–46 which would lead to increased
causal words (e.g. ‘because’) at the same time as words about their
perceptions (positive correlation). After delusions crystallise,

Fineberg et al
patients no longer seek explanations for their odd experiences
(they now rely on their delusion to do explanatory work),30 so
they talk less about the reasons when they describe their
experiences (negative correlation).44 We found a negative
correlation, consistent with our authors being further along in
their illness and outside of the delusional mood. To be in our
group, they have had symptoms for long enough to receive a
diagnosis of schizophrenia, and to accept it enough to write as a
person with the disorder. We expect that in this post-‘Aha!’ phase,
people use the explanation (delusion) as a perceptual schema – a
filter through which subsequent perceptual data are viewed – ‘the
trail is blazed and the now dominant delusion motivates future
apperceptive schema’.30 Confirmation biases and a general
tendency towards dogmatism in the face of contradictory evidence
prevail (in everyone, not just people with psychosis47). Once we
endorse a belief, our relationship to evidence changes. We are
more likely to refute or ignore evidence than to relinquish a
cherished belief or generate a new explanation47 (think here not
only of patients, but also of scientists).23,29
There was a positive correlation between perceptual and causal
words in the mood disorder group. Some studies find that people
with mood disorder are less prone to the biases that attend causal
inference; they show depressive realism.48 For example, they do
not have an illusory sense of control of non-contingent positive
outcomes. However, controls without mood disorder and patients
with psychosis felt they were in control when they were not.49 In
the absence of benefactance biases, people with mood disorder
may make a more straightforward connection between perception
and causation, and so be more likely to use them together.
Other factors likely modulate patients’ talk of both perception
and causality. In-patients with schizophrenia and delusions do not
report more current anomalous percepts than do psychiatric
controls without psychosis.50 This may be because treatment works:
antipsychotic drugs attenuate aberrantly salient experiences.51
However, patients also learn quickly that talking less about odd
experiences and ideas can lessen unwanted clinical attention and
unpleasant social interactions.52 They may learn to alter what they
say about their experiences.
The attenuation of aberrant salience by antipsychotic drugs51
could disconnect perception and belief, encouraging the adoption
of alternative non-delusional explanations.44,53 In fact, some
recovering patients actually report a kind of double awareness,
where they believe and do not believe their delusions.54 Presumably
this too would change the correlation between perceptual and
causal word use.
Future work will help to clarify which, if any, of these
explanations holds. Further investigations of spontaneous language
across phases of illness and recovery will be critical.
Limitations
The text samples for both disorders may have been edited before
publication and perhaps lost some of their original voice and
vocabulary through this process. The extent of editing may have
been uneven both within and across groups: we did not have
access to the unedited initial drafts during the development of this
project. Future work with un-edited language samples may
identify a broader signature of language changes specific to people
with schizophrenia. The schizophrenia and mood disorder essays
came from different sources, and although they were on the same
topic (‘what it is like to live with my mental illness’), this may
contribute to differences. Also, the mood disorder essays were
mostly directed at other patients (v. schizophrenia essays
published in an academic medical journal mostly read by health
professionals) and were on average half the length.
We cannot confirm diagnosis or symptomatology of the
authors whose essays we included in this project. The authors in
the schizophrenia group may have comorbid mood disorder and
the authors in the mood disorder group may have psychotic
symptoms. Furthermore, the authors of the schizophrenia essays
may represent a particularly functional group of people with
schizophrenia, as they are aware of this medical journal and have
written and submitted essays. Indeed, some are even peer
professionals and scientists with lived experience of psychosis55
who provide a uniquely relevant perspective on cognitive and
neuroscientific approaches to their symptoms.55
However, having read the essays, we are certain that most
patients’ accounts were not explicitly discussing cognitive
neuroscience and that the findings we report reflect the impact
of illness mechanisms on language. Importantly, we did note that
some language features in these essays that have been previously
observed in patients with schizophrenia: the schizophrenia essays
included several neologisms (Table DS1) whereas the mood
disorder essays contained none.56 We also suspect that the
observation of fewer punctuation marks in the schizophrenia
essays may represent a disorganised quality of the language.57
Finally, we note the lack of a non-psychiatric control group.
Such a sample would increase our confidence in the direction of
our findings – did the people with schizophrenia use ‘I’ less or
were the people with mood disorder using it more? We made a
priori predictions, based on prior data; future work will seek out
an appropriate comparison group.
Directions for future work
Future work will establish the relationships between the language
markers identified presently and the behavioural and neural
markers of disrupted learning and inference identified previously.13
It will be informative to sample language use across illness course
as delusions form and become engrained and resistant to
change.44 We will also consider people with different symptom
dimensions and disease severity. Indeed, we aim in the future
to use the written and spoken language of patients with schizo-
phrenia to classify patients not simply into diagnostic categories,
but to take a more dimensional approach to specific symptoms
– such as delusions – and use language as another means of testing
theoretical models of underlying pathology – much like the
Research Domain Criteria initiative which the National Institutes
of Health have put forth as a way to reorganise pathological
categories based on data-driven dimensions.58
We also expect that additional computational tools will allow
us to delve deeper into text features, such as proximity of word
types of interest and proposition density.56
Implications
We were able to identify differences in the writing of patients
with schizophrenia as compared with patients with mood
disorder. Some of these patterns of language use may actually be
relevant to the pathophysiology of symptoms. There is clearly
more work to do, but we feel this is an important first step
towards a more data-driven understanding of what our patients
are trying to tell us.

On Persuasion and Healing:
A Comparative Study of Psychotherapy (1961),
by Jerome D. Frank
Scott Henderson
Persuasion and Healing was one of the most significant books for psychiatry and
clinical psychology during the 20th century. Thirty years after it was first published,
Frank was joined by his daughter, Julia B. Frank, in an expanded edition in 1991. After
training in psychology and medicine at Harvard and Berlin, then psychiatry at the
Johns Hopkins University, he had come to formulate a truly fundamental question:
what is happening when we make a troubled person better? In trying to answer this,
Frank took the study of psychotherapy to a conceptually much higher level, doing so
in a non-partisan manner in times when psychoanalysis was endemic and highly
influential in America. He helped a whole generation think more deeply about
psychotherapy, to see beyond the immediacy of the doctor–patient situation. The
forces that are at work are also to be seen in religious healing ceremonies, in the
prescription of a placebo and in rhetoric using hermeneutics. In each, the recipient
is urged to accept the therapist’s assumptive world and is expected to be the better
for doing so.
As a registrar in 1963, I was encouraged to study Persuasion and Healing by a teacher
who had known Jerry when they worked briefly together in Australia during the
Second World War. It opened my mind to explanations that eclipsed the perplexing psychoanalytic principles I had been exposed
to in Aberdeen. Here was a psychiatrist who was using cognitive psychology and social anthropology better to understand an
important part of what a doctor tries to do. But at that time, any ambitious trainee in psychiatry was expected to have the physician’s
Membership. So I had to reconcile Persuasion and Healing with the large body of knowledge required for advanced medicine. This
made me see that psychiatry offered a wonderful diversity of ideas, although integrating it all proved demanding as well as addictive.
Frank showed that the features shared by all the psychotherapies account for much of their effectiveness. He identified four: an
emotionally charged relationship, a healing setting, a rationale or myth providing a plausible explanation for the symptoms, and a
procedure to resolve them. Cognitive–behavioural therapy no doubt fits this comfortably. But what about the new internet-based
treatments, where no therapist is physically present? Frank would probably suggest that the recipients must think some clever
person is behind it.
One further lesson comes from the book, and it is rather chastening. I once took Jerry Frank bird-watching in Tasmania. If I reminisce
about that visit, then ask registrars, psychiatrists or clinical psychologists under the age of about 60 years what they think of Frank’s
book, most have never heard of it. Only a few know his name. Not many names in psychiatry endure across centuries, so perhaps
this does not greatly matter in the long term. But what does matter is ignoring the ideas he set out for us, in helping understand a
large part of what we do.
