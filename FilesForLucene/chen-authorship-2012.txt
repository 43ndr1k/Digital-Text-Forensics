 1  Introduction 
 Analysis of web content is becoming increasingly important due to amplifi ed 
communication via Internet sources such as e-mail, web sites, and forums. The 
anonymous nature of these channels makes them an ideal source of contact for 
militant groups and terrorist organizations. Furthermore, the global nature of criminal 
activity necessitates the exploration of online communication in a multilingual con-
text. Application of authorship analysis techniques across multilingual web media 
is of dire importance for assisting in the identifi cation and prevention of potential 
criminal activity with national security implications. 
 Specifi cally, Arabic has garnered greater attention in recent years for sociopolitical 
reasons and ties between Middle Eastern groups and terrorism; however, there has 
been an absence of studies aimed at applying authorship techniques across the 
language. The morphological challenges pertaining to Arabic pose several critical 
problems for authorship identifi cation, which could be partially responsible for the 
lack of previous research relating to Arabic. 
 We modifi ed an existing framework for the application of authorship analysis of 
online messages and applied it to Arabic and English web forum messages associ-
ated with extremist groups. Special multilingual components were developed for 
the extraction and identifi cation of Arabic messages. These components were geared 
toward addressing the unique characteristics of the language. Furthermore, a com-
plex message extraction component was incorporated in order to allow the use of a 
more comprehensive set of features tailored specifi cally toward online messages.

 2  Literature Review: Authorship Analysis 
 Authorship analysis is the process of evaluating writing characteristics in order to 
make inferences about authorship. It is rooted in the linguistic area known as stylom-
etry, which is defi ned as the statistical analysis of literary style. Two major categories 
of authorship analysis are authorship identifi cation and authorship characterization. 
 Authorship identifi cation deals with attributing authorship of unidentifi ed writing 
based on stylistic similarities between the author’s known works and the unidenti-
fi ed piece. In contrast, a uthorship characterization attempts to formulate an author 
profi le by making inferences about gender, education, and cultural background 
based on writing style. Authorship identifi cation deals with classifi cation problems, 
whereas authorship characterization is used for clustering. 
 We are primarily concerned with the application of authorship identifi cation to 
English and Arabic online messages. In order to apply authorship identifi cation 
successfully, we had to begin by determining the relevant features and techniques to 
utilize. Unfortunately, the lack of consensus in previous authorship analysis litera-
ture coupled with the application of identifi cation methodologies to a new language 
made this task an arduous endeavor. 
 2.1  Writing Style Features 
 Writing style features are characteristics that can be derived from a message in order 
to facilitate authorship attribution. Numerous types of features have been used in 
previous studies including n-grams and the frequency of spelling and grammatical 
errors; however, four categories used extensively are lexical, syntactic, structural, 
and content-specifi c features. 
 Lexical features can be broken into two categories: word-based and character-based. 
 Word-based lexical features include total number of words, words per sentence, 
word-length distribution, vocabulary richness, etc.  Character-based lexical features 
include total number of characters, characters per sentence, characters per word, 
and the usage frequency of individual letters. 
 Syntax refers to the patterns used for the formation of sentences. This category of 
features is comprised of the tools used to structure sentences, such as punctuation 
and function words. Examples of function words are “while” and “upon.” Usage 
patterns of function words can be effective features for authorship identifi cation. 
For example, the difference between using the word “thus” or “hence” may appear 
subtle but can constitute a signifi cant stylistic difference. 
 Structural features deal with the organization and layout of the text. This set of 
features has been shown to be particularly important for online messages (De Vel 
et al.  2001 ) . Previously, structural features used have focused on  word structure 
such as the use of greetings and signatures, or the number of paragraphs and aver-
age paragraph length. While these features are important discriminators, online 
1552 Literature Review: Authorship Analysis
messages also provide additional information such as fonts, images, and links, 
which are not captured. Although these characteristics are not writing style features 
per se, they provide important insight into the authorship characteristics of the 
writer. The use of various font sizes and colors requires a conscientious effort, hence 
making it a style marker. Similarly, the ability to embed images and icons or pro-
vide links to different types of web sites can be a refl ection of technical prowess. 
Evaluation of technical characteristics measured in terms of the use of images, 
hyperlinks, and audio or video media is not a novel idea; it has been applied to web 
sites (Palmer and Griffi th  1998 ) . Thus, we propose a new subcategory of structural 
features called  technical structure which encompasses font, hyperlink, and embed-
ded image characteristics. 
 Content-specifi c features are words that are important within a specifi c topic domain. 
An example of content-specifi c words for a discussion on computers might be 
“RAM” and “laptop.” The rationale for content-specifi c words is similar to that of 
other word usage features but at a fi ner level of granularity. 
 2.2  Analysis Techniques 
 The two most commonly used analytical techniques for authorship attribution are 
statistical and machine learning approaches. Many multivariate statistical 
approaches, such as principal component analysis, have been shown to provide a 
high level of accuracy. However, some of the pitfalls associated with statistical 
approaches include the need for more stringent models and assumptions. 
 Drastic increases in computational power have caused the emergence of machine 
learning techniques such as support vector machines (SVM), neural networks, and 
decision trees. These techniques have gained wider acceptance in authorship analy-
sis studies in recent years (Zheng et al.  2003 ) . Machine learning approaches provide 
greater scalability in terms of number of features that can be handled and are less 
susceptible to noisier data as compared to statistical techniques. These benefi ts are 
ideal for identifi cation of online messages which entails classifi cation of more 
authors and a large feature set. 
 2.3  Online Messages 
 Online messages pose several problems for authorship identifi cation as compared to 
conventional forms of writing, with the biggest concern being message length. 
Writing style markers are far less visible for messages shorter than a few hundred 
words, with identifi cation becoming cumbersome or even impossible in such situa-
tions. The problem is further amplifi ed by the larger pool of potential authors in 
online attribution situations. 
 Additional diffi culties associated with online messages center around the casual 
style of online communication. E-mail and forum postings tend to be less formal 
156 9 Authorship Analysis
than traditional writing, resulting in more misspellings, unorthodox structure, 
increased use of abbreviations, and improper use of punctuation. As a consequence, 
application of authorship identifi cation to web content is intrinsically faced with a 
quagmire of noisy data. 
 Despite all the challenges, the unique structural characteristics of online messages 
may also provide helpful discriminators for identifi cation. Greetings, signatures, 
quotes, links, and the use of contact information (phone, e-mail) can offer signifi -
cant insight for authorship identifi cation. As previously elaborated, this set of 
features can be further enhanced with the inclusion of technical structure features. 
 2.4  Multilingual Issues 
 Applying authorship identifi cation across different languages is becoming increasingly 
important due to the rapid proliferation of the Internet and the ensuing threats that are 
created. Online analysis of Arabic is especially important due to the emergence of ter-
rorist organizations such as al-Qaeda. Nevertheless, there has been a lack of multilin-
gual research with the exception of a few studies done on Greek and Chinese (Peng 
et al.  2003 ; Stamatatos et al.  2001 ; Zheng et al.  2003 ) . The language dimension can 
create enormous challenges for authorship identifi cation since previously applied fea-
tures and techniques were designed for English. For example, the lack of word segmen-
tation in Chinese makes word-based lexical features (e.g., number of words in a 
sentence) diffi cult to extract. Additionally, the larger volume of words in Chinese makes 
vocabulary richness measures less effective. Similarly, Arabic also poses some unique 
challenges with respect to the structural and stylistic properties of the language. 
 3  Arabic Language Characteristics 
 Arabic is a Semitic language belonging to the group of Afro-Asian languages. Semitic 
languages have several characteristics that can cause diffi culties for authorship analysis, 
including properties such as infl ection, diacritics, word length, and elongation. 
 3.1  Infl ection 
 Infl ection is the derivation of stem words from a root. There are approximately 
5,000 roots in Arabic with each root being a 3–5-letter consonant combination 
( Beesley  1996 ) . Stems are created by adding affi xes (e.g., prefi xes) to the root. Over 
85% of Arabic words are derived from roots, and words with common roots are 
semantically related (Al-Fedaghi and Al-Anzi  1989 ) . The orthographical and mor-
phological properties of Arabic result in a great deal of lexical variation since words 
can take on numerous forms (Larkey and Connell  2001 ) . Infl ection creates feature 
extraction problems due to the larger number of possible words, impacting vocabu-
lary richness measures (Zheng et al.  2003 ) . 
1573 Arabic Language Characteristics
 Figure  9.1 shows an infl ection example demonstrating the derivation of two 
words (KTAB, MKTB) from the root KTB. For the root and stems, the top row 
shows the word written using English alphabet characters, and the second row 
shows the word written in Arabic. Since Arabic letters are joined, making it diffi cult 
for non-Arabic readers to decipher individual letters, the third row shows the decom-
posed Arabic word in parentheses. The words KTAB (book) and MKTB (desk) are 
created with the addition of the infi x “A” and the prefi x “M,” respectively. 
 3.2  Diacritics 
 Diacritics are markings above or below letters used to indicate special phonetic values. 
An example of diacritics in English would be the little mark found on top of the letter 
“e” in the word “résumé.” These markings alter the pronunciation and meaning of the 
word. Arabic uses diacritics in every word to represent short vowels, consonant 
lengths, and relationships between words; however, they are rarely used in online 
communication. Although readers can use the sentence semantics to decipher proper 
meaning, this is not feasible for an automated extraction program. For example, the 
words “resume” and “résumé” would look identical to a computer without diacritics. 
The lack of diacritics can signifi cantly impact the effectiveness of word-usage-based 
features such as function words. For example, in Arabic, it is impossible to differentiate 
between the words “who” and “from” without diacritics. 
 3.3  Word Length and Elongation 
 The shorter length of Arabic words as compared to English words may result in a 
reduction in the impact of many lexical features. Word-length features are less 
effective since Arabic word-length distributions have a smaller range. While the use 
 Fig. 9.1  Infl ection example 
 
158 9 Authorship Analysis
of lengthier words in English can sometimes be associated with greater writing 
complexity, this assumption does not hold true for Arabic. Additionally, Arabic 
words are sometimes elongated for purely stylistic reasons using a special character 
that resembles a dash (“–”) . Since Arabic characters are combined during writing, 
elongation is possible by lengthening the joins between letters. Although elongation 
provides an important authorship style marker, it can also create problems as illus-
trated by Table  9.1 . The word MZKR (“remind”) is extended with the addition of 
four dashes between the “M” and the “Z” (denoted by a faint oval) resulting in 
doubling of the word size. 
 Elongation can signifi cantly infl ate the values of word-length features. Handling 
elongation in terms of feature extraction is an important issue that must be resolved. 
 4  Research Questions and Research Design 
 We designed a series of experiments to test the effi cacy of authorship identifi cation 
techniques in an online setting. The objective of our experiments was to address 
numerous questions including:
 Will authorship analysis techniques be applicable in identifying authors in Arabic? • 
 What are the effects of using different types of features in identifying authors? • 
 Which classifi cation techniques are appropriate for authorship analysis? • 
 How does identifi cation performance differ between English and Arabic? • 
 What are the important feature differences between the English and Arabic • 
groups and language models? 
 4.1  Test Bed 
 Our test bed consisted of English and Arabic datasets extracted from web forum 
messages. In both instances, 20 messages were extracted for each of 20 authors, 
resulting in a total of 400 messages per language. The English dataset had an average 
message length of 76.6 words, while the Arabic average message length was 580.69 
words. The English messages were derived from a forum of a chapter of the White 
Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. The content associated with this group revolved 
around political, racial, and religious issues. Members commonly used profanities

and advocated the use of violence against groups whom they detested. In addition to 
general anger and animosity, there were also disturbing references to specifi c members 
of society. In some instances, complete contact information including address was 
provided for these targeted individuals. 
 The Arabic dataset was extracted from forum messages associated with an 
extremist group called the Al-Aqsa Martyrs. These messages had a strong anti-
American slant with members providing lengthy arguments in favor of their vantage 
point. There was an abundant use of embedded images and links relating to the war 
in Iraq and treatment of al-Qaeda prisoners. The image content was extremely 
graphic in nature and intended to be used as supporting material for the authors’ 
central arguments. Much like the English messages, authors in the Arabic forum 
advocated the infl iction of physical harm upon groups whom they disliked. 
 4.2  Analysis Techniques 
 In this chapter, we adopted two machine learning classifi ers: C4.5 and SVM. C4.5 
is a powerful decision tree-based classifi er that has been shown to rival other tech-
niques in terms of performance. SVM was developed on the premise of the structural 
risk minimization principle derived from computational learning theory and has 
gained popularity in the past decade. 
 Both techniques have been applied in previous authorship analysis research 
(Zheng et al.  2003 ) . We incorporated SVM for its classifi cation power and robustness. 
SVM is able to handle a large number of input values with great ease due to its 
capacity for dealing with noisy data. C4.5 was used for its analytical and explanatory 
potential. Decision trees provide an effective way to assess key differences between 
the English and Arabic feature sets. 
 4.3  Addressing Arabic Characteristics 
 In order to create an effective Arabic feature set, we had to address the morphological 
and orthographical properties of the language. Overcoming the diacritics problem 
would require the use of a semantic tagger. Since no feasible solutions exist, we 
decided to focus our attention toward the other challenges, namely, infl ection, elon-
gation, and word length. 
 4.3.1  Infl ection 
 Word roots have been shown to provide superior performance to normal Arabic 
words in information retrieval. As a result of heavy infl ection in Arabic, root indexing 
outperforms word indexing on both precision and recall (Hmeidi et al.  1997 ) . 
160 9 Authorship Analysis
We complemented our feature set by tracking usage frequencies of a select set of 
word roots. The use of word roots was intended to help compensate for the loss in 
effectiveness of vocabulary richness measures. Tracking root frequencies required 
matching words to their appropriate roots which could be accomplished using a 
clustering algorithm. 
 De Roeck and Fares  ( 2000 ) created a clustering algorithm specifi cally designed 
for Arabic, consisting of fi ve steps. However, this algorithm is meant to compare 
words against other words as opposed to roots. Since we are comparing words 
against a list of roots (an easier task), not all parts of the algorithm are necessary. We 
adapted the algorithm by using three of the fi ve steps, including blank insertion, 
cross, and Jaccard’s similarity score equation. 
 Root frequencies were extracted by calculating similarity scores for each word 
against a dictionary containing over 4,500 roots. Words were assigned to the root 
with the highest similarity score, and the usage frequency of the selected root was 
incremented. An important issue was determining the number of roots to include in 
the fi nal feature set. A trial-and-error approach was used since such methods have 
been used in other multilingual authorship studies due to a lack of previous research 
(Stamatatos et al.  2001 ) . In order to determine the number of roots to include, between 
0 and 500 of the most frequently occurring roots were added to the complete Arabic 
feature set. The classifi cation power of these roots was tested using SVM as the 
classifi er. The optimal number (50 roots) was integrated into the feature set. 
 4.3.2  Word Length and Elongation 
 Arabic words tend to be shorter than English words, with lengthier words (longer 
than ten characters) less common in Arabic. However, elongation of Arabic words 
can distort word-length distributions by artifi cially infl ating them. The use of elon-
gation is an important authorship style marker, and hence, the occurrence and degree 
(extent of stretching) of elongation should be tracked. However, a fi lter should be 
embedded into the feature extractor to remove elongation once it has been tracked 
in order to allow for precise capturing of word length. 
 4.4  Feature Sets 
 The English feature set was adapted from previous online authorship studies (De 
Vel et al.  2001 ; Zheng et al.  2003 ) and was composed of 301 features including 87 
lexical, 158 syntactic, 45 structural, and 11 content-specifi c features. The major dif-
ference from prior studies was that our feature set was enhanced with the inclusion 
of technical structure features. The technical structure features fell into four catego-
ries: font color, font size, and the use of embedded images and hyperlinks. 
 Inspection of the datasets revealed that there were 15 different font colors used 
in the English messages and over 120 in the Arabic! A closer look showed that 
1614 Research Questions and Research Design
many of the Arabic font colors were minor modifi cations of standard colors resulting 
in an infl ated count. Since most of these modifi ed colors were seldom used, we felt 
that they should not be included in the feature set in order to avoid overfi tting. The 
consolidated color count consisted of 12 colors for English and 29 for Arabic. Other 
technical structure features consisted of 8 font size, 4 embedded image, and 7 hyper-
link features. 
 The Arabic feature set, shown in Fig.  9.2 , was modeled after the English feature 
set. It was composed of 418 features, including 79 lexical, 262 syntactic, 62 struc-
tural, and 15 content-specifi c features. 
 The differences between the English and Arabic feature sets are highlighted by 
Table  9.2 . In order to compensate for the lack of diacritics and infl ection, a larger 
number of function words and 50 word roots were used. A smaller word-length 
distribution and short word threshold were also included in the Arabic dataset.

 5  Authorship Identifi cation Procedure 
 The complete online authorship identifi cation process consisted of three main steps: 
collection, extraction, and experimentation. Figure  9.3 shows the complete process 
design for Arabic authorship identifi cation. 
 5.1  Collection and Extraction 
 Web forums were identifi ed using spidering programs that crawled through the 
Internet searching for “Dark Web” material, which is content involving potentially 
dangerous or criminal activity that may be of interest for cybercrime and homeland 
security-related issues. Once the forums were recognized, collection programs 
stored the messages in text and HTML format. Extraction programs then derived

1636 Results and Discussion
writing style characteristics identifi ed in the feature sets from each message. The 
Arabic feature extractor was a bit more complex than the English one, owing to 
the need to account for elongation and infl ection. An elongation fi lter, clustering 
algorithm, and root dictionary were integrated into the Arabic extraction process. 
 5.2  Experiment 
 Once the feature values were extracted, they were categorized into four feature sets. 
The fi rst feature set (F1) consisted of lexical features, while the second (F2) encom-
passed lexical and syntactic features. Structural features were added to the fi rst two 
groups in the third feature set (F3), and content-specifi c features were inserted with the 
other three categories in the fourth set (F4), which consequently contained all features 
(lexical, syntactic, structural, and content specifi c). Such a stepwise increment of fea-
tures was utilized due to our perceptions concerning the order of importance of feature 
categories. Studies have shown that lexical and syntactic features are the most impor-
tant categories and hence form the foundation for structural and content-specifi c fea-
tures. We applied this concept in our design for testing the relevance of feature categories 
for online English and Arabic messages. For the experiment, we created 30 randomly 
selected samples of fi ve authors which were used in all experiments. Each sample of 
fi ve authors was evaluated using all 20 messages per author and 30-fold cross-valida-
tion with C4.5 and SVM. The overall accuracy was the average precision (# correctly 
identifi ed/total messages) across the 30 samples. The feature type and classifi cation 
accuracies were evaluated using pairwise  t tests across the samples (n = 30). 
 6  Results and Discussion 
 Authorship identifi cation accuracy results for the comparison of the different feature 
types and techniques are summarized in Table  9.3 . The overall accuracies were 
exceptional, especially considering the diffi cult nature of the task and in comparison 
to previous authorship studies. Perhaps most surprising was the relatively small 
drop in performance across languages. In both datasets, the accuracy kept increasing 
with the addition of more feature types. The maximum accuracy was achieved with 
the use of SVM and all features for English and Arabic.

 6.1  Comparison of Feature Types 
 All feature categories improved classifi cation accuracy in the stepwise analysis of 
features. Pairwise  t tests were conducted to show the statistical signifi cance of the 
additional feature types added. The results shown in Table  9.4 indicate that all 
feature types signifi cantly improved accuracy for Arabic and English, except for 
content-specifi c words. This category of features was statistically insignifi cant in 
two situations ( P = 0.1628,  P = 0.1216) and signifi cant at a lower alpha level in a 
third instance ( P = 0.0224). The weaker performance of content-specifi c features 
could be attributable to their less prominent representation in the feature set in terms 
of number of features. There were only 11 and 15 content-specifi c features used in 
the English and Arabic feature sets, respectively. This number is far less than all 
other categories of features. Overall, the impact of the different feature types for 
Arabic was consistent with English results. 
 6.2  Comparison of Classifi cation Techniques 
 Table  9.5 reveals that SVM signifi cantly outperformed the decision tree classifi er in 
all cases. This is consistent with previous studies that have shown SVM to be better 
equipped to handle larger feature sets and noisier data (characteristics associated

with online authorship identifi cation). The difference in accuracy between classifi ers 
across Arabic was far greater than English: SVM outperformed C4.5 by over 20% 
on all feature set combinations. 
 7  Analysis of English and Arabic Group Models 
 We evaluated the important features for the two group forums based on decision tree 
analysis and overall feature usage. The analysis highlighted some of the key differ-
ences between the language models and revealed some interesting trends pertaining 
to the English and Arabic groups. 
 7.1  Decision Tree Analysis 
 The C4.5 decision tree can be used as an effective analytical tool due to its descriptive 
nature. Decision trees can be visualized to look at the effect of individual features, since 
trees choose the features with the highest discriminatory power, measured in terms of 
entropy reduction. We analyzed the C4.5 trees for the English and Arabic group models 
and extracted a list of the important features based on decision tree outputs. 
 Table  9.6 highlights the key differences between the English and Arabic models, 
based on the decision tree evaluations. For a particular group of features, the “Used” 
column indicates the number of features used, while the “Total” column refers to the 
total number of that feature type in the feature set. The “% Used” column indicates 
the percentage of that feature group incorporated by the decision tree and provides 
a good basis for comparing the KKK and Al-Aqsa Martyrs feature usage. 
 The specifi c features integrated into the feature set for Arabic played an important 
role based on the decision tree analysis. Both elongation features and nearly half the 
word roots were deemed as vital attributes based on the C4.5 output, indicating that 
these are important Arabic characteristics that should be adopted in future studies. 
Furthermore, as expected, word length played a more critical role in the English 
KKK messages (40%) as compared to Arabic Al-Aqsa Martyrs messages (20%).

166 9 Authorship Analysis
 The importance of punctuation, function words, and word-based structural features 
was fairly consistent across both languages. This suggests that syntactical and 
structural features are fairly robust feature categories that can be applied across 
languages. The largest disparity in terms of feature importance was in the technical 
structure category. The use of font size, color, hyperlinks, and embedded images 
was more important in classifying messages from the Al-Aqsa Martyrs. The preva-
lence in usage of technical structure features for the Arabic group did not come as a 
complete surprise; however, the amount of such features used by the decision tree 
(66.7%) was beyond our expectations. 
 7.2  Feature Usage Analysis 
 In order to provide a more in-depth analysis of the differences between the KKK 
and Al-Aqsa Martyrs messages, a graph consisting of writing attributes common to 
the two groups was constructed. The visualization consisted of only lexical and 
structural features, since these feature groups are mostly language independent. 
Figure  9.4 shows the average usage by language for each of these attributes. 
 Fig. 9.4  Comparison of group authorship characteristics 
 
1677 Analysis of English and Arabic Group Models
 The values were normalized to a 0–1 scale in order to facilitate more accurate 
comparisons. Five major feature groups within the lexical and structural categories 
were identifi ed, consisting of character lexical, word lexical, word length, word struc-
ture, and technical structure. These groups were further decomposed into subgroups 
(e.g., paragraph structure) represented in either light gray or white. In addition to 
demonstrating obvious linguistic dissimilarities, the comparison revealed several 
interesting subtleties which may be attributable to group or cultural differences. 
 7.2.1  Word/Character Lexical 
 The word- and character-level lexical features showed that the Al-Aqsa messages 
tended to be considerably longer than the KKK messages. In addition to overall 
length, sentence lengths were longer as well for the Al-Aqsa Martyrs messages. 
 7.2.2  Word Length 
 Based on our data, midsized Arabic words in the 6–10-letter range were far more 
prevalent than English words. However, longer Arabic words (greater than length 
ten) were less common. This is consistent with previous research suggesting that 
Arabic has a narrower word-length distribution than English. 
 7.2.3  Word Structure 
 Overall, the Al-Aqsa messages had a more formal structure, with greater use of 
greetings, more sentences, more paragraphs, and lengthier paragraphs. Unsurprisingly, 
author contact information was not provided very often, but the KKK authors more 
commonly supplied e-mail addresses and phone numbers. Typically, the addresses 
and phone numbers provided belonged to groups/individuals disliked by the author. 
 7.2.4  Technical Structure 
 Al-Aqsa messages used a plethora of font colors and sizes, often using them as tools 
to emphasize a certain point. Red, blue, and navy were used almost as much as black. 
This was in sharp contrast to the KKK messages, where black 10–12-point fonts 
were a fi xture, with the exception of the occasional deviation to green or blue. 
 The Al-Aqsa messages had a far higher frequency of embedded images than the 
KKK messages (approximately 20 times more). The images were either photos or 
graphics represented by JPEGs and GIFs. The majority of the disparity in the use of 
embedded images was with respect to GIF and PNG fi le usage. The Al-Aqsa Martyrs 
forum messages frequently used GIFs to represent slogans and logos while there 
were no signs of this in the KKK messages. 
168 9 Authorship Analysis
 The Al-Aqsa group’s messages also had far greater links to static, dynamic, and 
image pages. Links to multimedia fi les existed in both forums; however, such direct 
links were not very common. Some multimedia links were via web sites, thus clas-
sifi ed as web page links by the parser. 
 7.2.5  Inferences 
 Both forums consisted of messages that stated opinions and beliefs. However, the 
structure and dynamics of the two groups were quite different. The KKK forum 
messages were shorter and more conversational, implying greater familiarity 
between members. The Al-Aqsa group messages were more structured and formal 
and had a stronger persuasive inclination. The authors appeared to be making a 
concerted effort to state and justify their position by using a systematic and thor-
ough writing approach. Bulleted points, paragraphs with headings, and generally 
longer message lengths, supported by embedded images and links, were the stan-
dard structural theme for the Al-Aqsa messages. 
 8  Conclusions and Future Directions 
 In this research, we successfully applied authorship identifi cation techniques for the 
classifi cation of English and Arabic extremist group forum messages. In order to 
accomplish this task, we used techniques and features to overcome the challenges 
realized based on the linguistic properties of Arabic. All feature types incorporated 
(lexical, syntactic, structural, and content specifi c) showed signifi cant discriminating 
power for Arabic and English, resulting in exceptional classifi cation accuracy. 
 With an established set of features and techniques for multilingual authorship 
analysis, we have several potential future directions. One of the limitations of cur-
rent authorship identifi cation methodologies is the number of authors that it can be 
applied to. In order to truly address the online anonymity problem, the techniques 
would require signifi cant upward scalability to help discriminate between hundreds 
of potential authors. The development of more complex methodologies for differen-
tiating between a larger set of authors is an important future endeavor. We also plan 
a more comprehensive analysis of English and Arabic extremist group authorship 
tendencies in order to distinguish group-level differences from linguistic disparities 
inherent between English and Arabic. For example, do the “persuasive” tendencies 
observed regarding the Al-Aqsa Martyrs messages have broader applicability to 
other extremist Arabic groups? Furthermore, what role does geographic proximity 
and time play on group and individual authorship characteristics? Evaluation of 
these questions could prove to be an interesting venture.
