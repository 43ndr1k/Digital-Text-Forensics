Abstract
This study from the area of language variation and change is based on exploitation of the comparable diachronic and synchronic corpora
of 20th century British and American English language (the ‘Brown family’ of corpora). We investigate recent changes of lexical density
and lexical richness in two consecutive thirty-year time gaps in British English (1931–1961 and 1961–1991) and in 1961–1992 in
American English. Furthermore, we compare the diachronic changes between these two language varieties and discuss the results of the
synchronic comparison of these two features between British and American parts of the corpora (in 1961 and in 1991/2). Additionally,
we explore the possibilities of these comparable corpora by using two different approaches to their exploitation: using the fifteen
fine-grained text genres, and using only the four main text categories. Finally, we discuss the impact of the chosen approaches in making
hypotheses about the way language changes.

1. Introduction
Kroch (2008) defines language change as “a failure in the
transmission across time of linguistic features” and states
that “over historical time languages change at every level
of the language structure: vocabulary, phonology, mor-
phology and syntax”. He states that in principle, language
change can occur within groups of adult native speakers of
language as the result of the substitution of one feature with
another as in the case of the substitution of old words with
new ones, though he raises a doubt in the validity of this hy-
pothesis in the case of syntactic and grammatical changes.
1.1. Lexical density and lexical richness
In this study, our focus was only at the vocabulary level of
the language change. We wanted to investigate how the lex-
ical density and lexical richness were changing during the
20th century. Lexical density is one of the most commonly
used features for describing diversity of a vocabulary (Sta-
matatos et al., 2000). Smith and Kelly (2002), for instance,
used this feature for dating works. Lexical density is calcu-
lated as the ratio between the number of unique word types
and the total number of tokens in the given text. There-
fore, a higher lexical density would indicate a wider range
of used vocabulary. However, as lexical density counts
morphological variants of the same word as different word
types (tokens), Corpas Pastor et al. (2008) suggested the
use of another measure – lexical richness, instead. The lex-
ical richness is computed as the ratio between the number of
unique lemmas and the total number of tokens in the given
text. This second measure does not take into account dif-
ferent morphological counts of the same word as different
word types. Therefore, Corpas Pastor et al. (2008) believed
that it would be a more appropriate indicator of the vocab-
ulary variety of an author.
1.2. Diachronic corpora of 20th century English
language
There are several corpora of English language consisting
of the texts published in the 20th century, compiled princi-
pally for purposes of grammatical researches, but they are
usually not publicly available or they cover only a specific
genre. The ARCHER corpus (Biber et al., 1994), for in-
stance, belongs to the first of the mentioned groups. It cov-
ers a wide range of genres - drama, medical, historical and
news reportage texts, from 1650 to 1990 divided into fifty-
year blocks, but is not available to the research commu-
nity (Leech and Smith, 2005). The Corpus of Late Mod-
ern English Prose (Denison, 1994), a collection of infor-
mal private letters written in British English between 1861
and 1919 is, on the other hand, available to the research
community, but it covers only one genre and belongs more
to the 19th than to the 20th century. The Corpus of En-
glish Newspaper Editorials – CENE (Westin, 2002; Westin
and Geisler, 2002), which consists of institutional editorials
of three ‘broadsheet’ British newspapers - The Times, The
Guardian and The Daily Telegraph, sampled at ten-year in-
tervals across the 20th century (Leech and Smith, 2005) and
the Bauer‘s corpus of The Times (Bauer, 1994), also con-
sisting of editorials sampled at decade intervals (Leech and
Smith, 2005), both belong to the intersection of the above
two types as they cover only a specific genre and they are
not publicly available.
1.3. The ‘Brown family’ of corpora
The ‘Brown family’ of corpora is comprised of five mu-
tually comparable corpora. The American part consists of
two corpora:
• The Brown University corpus of written American En-
glish – Brown (Francis, 1965)
• The Freiburg - Brown Corpus of American English –

Table 1: Structure of the corpora
Frown (Hundt et al., 1998).
The British part consists of three corpora:
• The Lancaster1931 – BLOB (Leech and Smith, 2005)
• The Lancaster-Oslo/Bergen Corpus – LOB (Johans-
son et al., 1978)
• The Freiburg-LOB Corpus of British English – FLOB
(Sand and Siemund, 1992).
The corpora contain texts published in years 1931±3 (Lan-
caster1931), 1961 (LOB and Brown), 1991 (FLOB) and
1992 (Frown) divided into 15 different genres (Table 1).
These five corpora comply with the formal criteria of com-
parability as the texts have been compiled on the basis of
the same sampling frame and with similar balance and rep-
resentativeness. In particular, the texts have been selected
to match the same domain and topics, and are of compara-
ble size. Therefore, they fulfill all the necessary conditions
for being widely used throughout the linguistic community
– they are a diachronic corpora of 20th century written En-
glish texts, which cover a wide range of genres and are pub-
licly available as part of the ICAME Corpus Collection1.
The Brown corpus was published first, back in 1964. One
of the ideas of compiling the Brown corpus was to help
“to have a common body of material on which studies of
various sorts can be based” (Leech and Smith, 2005) and
in that way to provide some kind of ‘standard’ for the fol-
lowing parallel corpora of British English or for English of
other periods to be matched (Francis, 1965 in Leech and
Smith, 2005). It was a one-million-word corpus, consist-
ing of 500 texts of about 2000 running words each, se-
lected at random points from the original source and the
texts covered fifteen different text genres. Following that
idea, the LOB corpus (Johansson at al. 1978) of written
British English was compiled as the first corpus to match
the Brown corpus, respecting the year of sampling (1961)
and its sampling frame and representation of different text
1http://icame.uib.no/newcd.htm
types (Leech and Smith, 2005). The release of the LOB
corpus enabled synchronic comparison between two ma-
jor English language varieties across a wide range of text
genres. In the 1990s, the FLOB and Frown corpora were
compiled at Freiburg University representing, respectively,
written British English in 1991 and American English in
1992. As their design matched closely to the design of the
LOB and Brown corpora, this provided the opportunity to
investigate and compare diachronic changes between two
major varieties of the written English language. The exact
procedure for diachronic matching applied during the com-
pilation of the FLOB and Frown corpora could be found
in (Leech and Smith, 2005, p.8). Later on, the research
to extend the Brown model backwards in time, undertaken
at the Lancaster University, led to the compilation of the
Lancaster1931 corpus to match the design of the LOB and
FLOB corpora. The target sampling year in this case was
1931 (± three years), in order to maintain the thirty-year
gap already established between LOB and FLOB corpora,
as well as between Brown and Frown corpora.
Being all mutually comparable, these five corpora (BLOB,
LOB, FLOB, Brown and Frown) create the possibility for
several different types of investigation:
• Synchronic comparison between British and Ameri-
can English in 1961 and in 1991/2
• Diachronic comparison among the texts published in
1931, 1961 and 1991 in British English
• Diachronic comparison among the texts published in
1961 and 1992 in American English
• Comparison of diachronic changes in 1961–1991/2
between British and American English
1.4. Structure of the corpora
Each of the corpora (BLOB, LOB, FLOB, Brown and
Frown) consist of approximately 1,000,000 words – 500
texts of about 2000 running words each. The texts cover
fifteen different text genres (Table 1), which could be fur-
ther grouped into four more generalised categories: Press
89
(A–C), Prose (D–H), Learned (J) and Fiction (K–R). This
structure of the corpora allows three different approaches to
the exploitation of the corpora in diachronic studies:
1. Differentiating between texts only across two different
language varieties or two different years of publication
(without differentiating between texts across the text
genres/categories).
2. Differentiating between texts across the four main text
categories (Press, Prose, Learned and Fiction), thus
exploring diachronic changes separately in each of the
four main text categories.
3. Differentiating between texts across all fifteen fine-
grained text genres (A–R), thus exploring diachronic
changes separately in each of the fifteen fine-grained
text genres.
2. Related work
The ‘Brown family’ of corpora has already been used in
many diachronic studies of various lexical, grammatical,
stylistic and syntactic features, e.g. (Mair and Hundt, 1995;
Mair, 1997; Mair et al., 2002; Smith, 2002; Smith, 2003b;
Smith, 2003a; Leech, 2003; Leech, 2004; Leech and Smith,
2006; Mair and Leech, 2006; Leech and Smith, 2009;
Leech et al., 2009; Štajner and Mitkov, 2011). A large set
of these studies shared the same methodology. The corpora
were part-of-speech tagged, the change was presented in
terms of the absolute and relative differences and the statis-
tical significance was measured by the log likelihood func-
tion. The first attempt for a completely automated feature
extraction from the raw text version of the ‘Brown family’
of corpora in diachronic studies was reported by Štajner and
Mitkov (2011). The corpora were parsed with the state-of-
the-art Connexor’s Machinese Syntax parser2 and the fea-
tures were automatically extracted from the parser’s output.
Statistical significance of the results was measured by the
t-test.
However, all of these previous studies used the aforemen-
tioned second approach, differentiating only between texts
across the four main categories (Press, Prose, Learned and
Fiction). Following the discussion in (Stajner, 2011) about
the impact of the chosen genre granularity (aforementioned
approaches 1–3), we decided to use the third approach and
differentiate between texts across all fifteen fine-grained
text genres (A–R), in order to obtain a better understanding
of how lexical density and richness change. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first diachronic study conducted
on the ‘Brown family‘ of corpora using this approach.
Of the most relevance for this work was the study con-
ducted by Štajner and Mitkov (2011), where the authors
investigated diachronic changes of lexical density (LD) and
lexical richness (LR) in the period 1961–1991/2 and used
the same methodology for feature extraction. However,
they only differentiated between texts across the four main
text categories (Press, Prose, Learned and Fiction). In this
study, we went one step further, by differentiating between
texts across all fifteen fine-grained text genres (A–R). This
2http://www.connexor.eu
approach allowed us to obtain a better insight into the way
language changes. It also gave us the opportunity to com-
pare the results obtained by these two different approaches
and draw attention to the possible pitfalls in making hy-
potheses by differentiating between texts only across the
four main text categories. In that sense, the results pre-
sented in this study could also be taken as an additional
support for the claims made in (Štajner, 2011).
In this study, we also extended the time span in British En-
glish by using the Lancaster1931 corpus. Therefore, we
were able to compare the trends of change in two consec-
utive thirty-year time gaps (1931–1961 and 1961–1991) in
British English and examine whether the trend of change
was stable during the whole sixty-year period.
3. Methodology
In this study, we followed the methodology for feature ex-
traction proposed by Štajner and Mitkov (2011). All five
corpora were used in their initial raw text format and then
parsed with the state-of-the-art Connexor’s Machinese Syn-
tax parser for the purposes of tokenisation and lemmatisa-
tion. The main reason for using the same parser and the
same methodology, although the tokenisation and lemma-
tisation could have been done by some lighter tools, was
to be able to compare our results obtained for all fifteen
text genres (the aforementioned third approach) with those
results reported by Štajner and Mitkov (2011) when the au-
thors were differentiating only between the texts across the
four main text categories (the aforementioned second ap-
proach). As the performance of the parser in this task and
its specificities regarding the tokenisation and lemmatisa-
tion processes were already discussed in details in (Štajner
and Mitkov, 2011), here we will just highlight the most im-
portant ones in order to facilitate a better understanding of
the presented results.
The lexicon of the Connexor’s Machinese Syntax parser
was built using various large corpora of different text genres
– news, bureaucratic documents, literature etc. (Connexor,
2006) and contains hundreds of thousands of base forms.
The words which are not found in the lexicon are assigned
their word class and base form by using the heuristic meth-
ods (Connexor, 2006). The software which was used as a
base for the current version of the parser reported an ex-
cellent accuracy (Samuelsson and Voutilainen, 1998) and
the parser itself reported the POS accuracy of 99.3% on
Standard Written English (benchmark from the Maastricht
Treaty) with no ambiguity (Connexor, 2006).
3.1. Tokenisation
The Connexor’s Machinese parser treats the contracted neg-
ative form (n’t) and its antecedent verb as two separate to-
kens. E.g. aren’t would be separated into two tokens are
and not and assigned two separate base forms – be and not.
The ’s is treated in two different ways, depending on the
role it has in the sentence. When it represents a geni-
tive form, e.g. “... Isaac’s illness...” (FLOB: K02), it
is treated as one token and is assigned the corresponding
lemma isaac. In other cases where ’s represents the con-
traction of the verb to be (is) or to have (has), e.g. “ He’s
at a table over there.” (FLOB: K01), the personal pronoun
90
and verb contraction are treated as two separate tokens he
and is and assigned two separate base forms he and be, ac-
cordingly.
3.2. Lemmatisation
The output of the lemmatisation process done by the Con-
nexor’s Machinese parser expresses certain differences be-
tween the earlier versions and the current version of the
parser. The main difference is in the way that possessive
pronouns, derived adverbs, and EN and ING forms are
treated.
While the earliest versions of the parser would assign the
corresponding personal pronoun as the lemma of the given
possessive pronoun (e.g. the word theirs would be assigned
their as its lemma), the current version of the parser assigns
their own base forms to possessive pronouns (e.g. the word
theirs is assigned theirs as its lemma).
A similar rule applies to derived adverbs. In the previous
versions of the parser, derived adverbs, such as absolutely
or directly would be assigned absolute and direct as their
lemmas, while in the current version of the parser, these
same derived adverbs are assigned their own base forms –
absolutely and directly.
The EN and ING forms, which can represent either present
and past participles or corresponding nouns and adjectives,
are assigned a POS tag (EN, ING, N or A) and different
base forms in the current version of the parser, according to
their usage in that particular case. For example, if the word
meeting is recognised as a noun by the parser, it will be as-
signed meeting as the corresponding lemma. In case that
the same word is recognised as a present participle of the
verb to meet, it will be assigned meet as its corresponding
lemma. The results would be similar in the case of an EN
form. For example, if the word selected represents an ad-
jective in the given context, it will be assigned selected as
its lemma. In another case, if it represents a past participle,
it will be assigned select as the corresponding lemma.
These differences between previous and current versions of
the parser in lemmatising certain word forms is reflected
in the differences between the lexical richness and lexical
density. It is reasonable to expect that the calculated LD
and LR will be much closer if we use the current version
than if we use an earlier version of the parser.
3.3. Feature extraction
The lexical density (LD) and lexical richness (LR) were
calculated for each text separately in order to enable later
applied statistical tests. Lexical density was calculated as
the total number of unique word forms (tokens) divided by
the total number of tokens in the given text (eq.1).
LD =
number of unique tokens
total number of tokens
(1)
Lexical richness was calculated similarly, this time using
the total number of unique lemmas divided by the total
number of tokens (eq.2).
LR =
number of unique lemmas
total number of tokens
(2)
4. Experimental settings
The purpose of this study was two-fold: (1) to investigate
diachronic changes of lexical density and lexical richness
in 20th century English language in each of the fifteen fine-
grained text genres, and (2) to compare the results of two
different approaches to the exploitation of these compara-
ble corpora. Therefore, we had two different sets of exper-
iments. The first set of experiments consisted of investi-
gating the following five changes using the third approach
(differentiating between the texts across the all fifteen fine-
grained text genres):
• Diachronic changes in British English in the period
1931–1961
• Diachronic changes in British English in the period
1961–1991
• Diachronic changes in American English in the period
1961–1992
• Synchronic differences between British and American
English in 1961
• Synchronic differences between British and American
English in 1991/2.
The second set of experiments consisted of the same five
experiments, but this time using the second approach (dif-
ferentiating between the texts only across the four main text
categories).
4.1. Statistical significance testing
For each of the aforementioned five experiments we calcu-
lated the statistical significance of the mean differences be-
tween the two corresponding groups of texts. Statistical sig-
nificance tests are divided into two main groups: parametric
(which assume that the samples are normally distributed)
and non-parametric (which do not make any assumptions
about the sample distribution). In the cases where the sam-
ples follow the normal distribution, it is recommended to
use parametric tests as they have greater power than non-
parametric tests (Garson, 2012a). Therefore, we first ap-
plied the the Shapiro-Wilk’s W test (Garson, 2012b) of-
fered by SPSS EXAMINE module in order to examine in
which cases/genres/categories the features were normally
distributed. This test is a standard test for normality, rec-
ommended for small samples. It shows the correlation be-
tween the given data and their expected normal scores. If
the result of the W test is 1, it means that the distribution of
the data is perfectly normal. Significantly lower values of
W (≤ 0.05) indicate that the assumption of normality is not
met. Those cases are shown in bold (Table 2).
Following the discussion in (Garson, 2012c), for both ap-
proaches we used the following strategy: if the two data sets
we wanted to compare were both normally distributed we
used the t-test for the comparison of their means; if at least
one of the two data sets was not normally distributed (W ≤
0.05 in Table 2), we used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Z test
(a non-parametric test) for two independent samples to cal-
culate the statistical significance of the differences between
their means.

Table 2: Normal distribution testing (Shapiro-Wilk’s W test results)
It is interesting to note that in some cases, even if the data
in fine-grained text genres follow the normal distribution
(e.g. genres A–C in columns LD and LR of British En-
glish in 1991), the data in that whole text category (Press
in columns LD and LR of British English in 1991) do not
follow the same distribution. Also, we can find examples
of the opposite situation when some of the data in the fine-
grained text genres (e.g. genre A in columns LD and LR
of British English in 1961) do not follow the normal distri-
bution, but the data in the corresponding broader text cat-
egory (Press in columns LD and LR of British English in
1961) are normally distributed. This second case is intu-
itively more expected as we know that the bigger the data
set, the more chance there is that the data would be nor-
mally distributed. However, both the cases force us to use
different statistical significance tests for the second and for
the third approach.
5. Results and discussion
Our study basically has two main parts: diachronic compar-
ison (1931–1961 and 1961–1991 in British English; 1961–
1992 in American English) and synchronic comparison of
British and American English (in 1961 and in 1991/2).
Therefore, we will present the results separately for di-
achronic (separately for LD and LR) and synchronic com-
parisons (together for LD and LR) in the next three sub-
sections. In each of these subsections, together with our
main results obtained by using the third approach (differen-
tiating across fifteen fine-grained text genres) we will also
present the results of the alternative second approach (dif-
ferentiating across only four main text categories), in or-
der to be able to compare the differences in the conclu-
sions drawn from these two approaches. Statistically sig-
nificant changes at a 0.05 level significance (sign. ≤ 0.05)
are shown in bold.
5.1. Diachronic changes of lexical density (LD)
The results of the investigation of diachronic changes of
lexical density (LD) in British and American English are
presented in Table 3 (using the third approach) and Table 4
(using the second approach). In both cases we followed the
same pattern of representing the results. Columns ‘1931’,
‘1961’ and ‘1991’ under ‘British English’, and columns
‘1961’ and ‘1992’ under ‘American English’ represent the
calculated average LD in those years for the correspond-
ing language variety. Columns ‘1931–1961’, ‘1961–1991’
and ‘1961–1992’ contain the information about the changes
of LD in those periods for the corresponding language va-
rieties. Their subcolumn ‘sign.’ represent the calculated
two-tailed statistical significance of the differences between
the corresponding means, by using t-test or Kolmogorov-
Smirnov Z test, according to Table 2 and the discussion
in Subsection 4.1. The subcolumn ‘change’ contains the
relative change in the observed period, calculated as a per-
centage of the starting value. The sign ‘+’ stands for an
increase and the sign ‘−’ for a decrease over the time.
5.1.1. British English
The results presented in Table 3 indicate several interesting
phenomena. First, we can notice that diachronic changes
in British English were generally not stable in the two sub-
sequent periods 1931–1961 and 1961–1991. Most of the
genres demonstrated significant changes only in one of the
two observed periods. In genres G (Belles Lettres, Bi-
ographies, Essays) and R (Humour), LD had changed (in-
creased) only in the first period 1931–1961, while in genres
A (Press: Reportage), B (Press: Editorial), C (Press: Re-
view), D (Religion) and P (Romance and Love Story) it had
changed (increased) only in the second period 1961–1991.
Genre E (Skills, Trades and Hobbies) was the only genre
that showed a stable increase of LD throughout both periods

Table 4: Diachronic changes of lexical density (LD) – second approach
1931–1961 and 1961–1991. The most interesting might be
the case of genre N (Adventure and Western) which demon-
strated a significant change of LD in both periods although
these changes had opposite directions. While in the first pe-
riod (1931–1961) LD had decreased, in the second period
(1961–1991) it had increased. At the same time, the de-
crease of LD in this genre is the only observed significant
decrease of LD in British English in this study.
5.1.2. American English
In American English, the results (Table 3) indicated a sig-
nificant increase of LD in four genres: B (Press: Editorial),
C (Press: Review), E (Skills, Trades and Hobbies) and F
(Popular Lore), and a significant decrease of LD in genre
R (Humour). At the same time, this change of LD in genre
R was of a significantly higher intensity than the changes
reported in other genres.
5.1.3. British vs. American English
The comparison of diachronic changes of LD between
British and American English in the period 1961–1991/2
indicates that the most of the genres did not undergo the
same changes at the same time. For instance, genres A
(Press: Reportage), D (Religion), N (Adventure and West-
ern) and P (Romance and Love Story) demonstrated a
change only in British English, while genres F (Popular
Lore) and R (Humour) demonstrated a change of LD only
in American English during the same period 1961–1991/2.
The only genres which reported a significant increase of LD
in both language varieties during that period were genres B
(Press: Editorial), C (Press: Review) and E (Skills, Trades
and Hobbies).
5.1.4. Second vs. third approach
The first obvious difference in conclusions drawn from the
results of the second approach (Table 4) and those of the
third approach (Table 3) is that by using solely the results
of the second approach we would conclude that whenever
there was a change, LD has increased. By closer exam-
ination of the corpora (Table 3), we notice that in fact a
significant decrease of LD is also likely to happen, as in the
case of genre N (Adventure and Western) in British English
(1931–1961) and genre R (Humour) in American English
(1961–1992).
The other differences between the conclusions drawn from
these two approaches are more subtle but maybe even more
important to mention. The most drastic difference can
be noticed in Fiction category of British English (1931–
1961), and Fiction and Press categories in American En-
glish (1961–1992). While the results of the second ap-
proach (Table 4) reported no changes of LD in these par-
ticular cases, the results of the third approach (Table 3) re-
vealed some interesting phenomena in the corresponding
genres. In American English, a very intensive decrease of
LD in genre R (present in the results of the third approach),
was probably masked in the second approach by the con-
stancy of LD in other genres of this category (genres K–P)
which have a greater number of texts than genre R (Table1

Table 6: Diachronic changes of lexical density (LR) – second approach
in Section 1.4). The differences in the Prose category of
American English could be explained in the same way. In
British English, however, the situation was even more com-
plex. The results of the second approach did not only mask
the changes of LD in certain genres (N and R), but they
also hid the fact that the changes in these two genres went
in opposite directions (an increase of LD in genre R and a
decrease of LD in genre N).
Less pronounced, but still worth mentioning, were the dif-
ferences between the results of the second and third ap-
proaches in Prose (1931–1961, 1961–1991) and Fiction
(1961–1991) categories of British English, and Prose cat-
egory of American English. In these cases, the results of
the second approach reported significant changes of LD in
these categories (Table 4), while the more detailed analysis
used in the third approach (Table 3) actually demonstrated
that these changes were present only in certain genres of
the mentioned categories and not in all of them.
5.2. Diachronic changes of lexical richness (LR)
Diachronic changes of lexical richness (LR) in British and
American English are presented in the same manner as in
the case of lexical density. Table 5 contains the results of
the third approach and Table 6 the results of the second
approach.
5.2.1. British English
Similar to the case of LD, LR did not show the same trends
of changes in both observed periods 1931–1961 and 1961–
1991 in most of the genres. In genre R (Humour) a change
was present only in the first period (1931–1961), while in
genres A (Press: Reportage), B (Press: Editorial), C (Press:
Review), D (Religion) and P (Romance and Love Story) a
change was present only in the second period (1961–1991).
In genres E (Skills, Trades and Hobbies) and G (Belles Let-
tres, Biographies, Essays), LR had increased in both peri-
ods, while in genre N (Adventure and Western) it first had
decreased (in period 1931–1961) and then increased (in the
period 1961–1991).
If we compare these results for LR with those obtained for
LD (Table 3), we can notice that in most genres, LD and LR
demonstrated similar diachronic changes. The only excep-
tion to this was reported in genre G (Belles Lettres, Biogra-
phies, Essays) in the period 1961–1991 , where LD did not
show any statistically significant change, while LR reported
an increase of +3.35%.
5.2.2. American English
The results of the investigation of diachronic changes of
LR in American English (Table 5) reported a higher lexical
richness in 1992 than in 1961 in genres C (Press: Review)
and E (Skills, Trades and Hobbies). In genre R (Humour)
the situation was the opposite. In this genre, LR was re-
ported to be higher in 1961 than in 1992.
The comparison of diachronic changes between LD and
LR (Table 3 and Table 5) indicate similar behaviour of
these two features in all three genres in which a signifi-
cant change of LR was reported. Additionally, LD demon-

Table 7: Synchronic comparison of LD and LR in 1961 and 1991/2 (British vs. American English)
strated a change in genres B (Press: Editorial) and F (Pop-
ular Lore), in which LR did not report any changes.
5.2.3. British vs. American English
The results of the comparison of diachronic changes of LR
between British and American English indicates that this
feature underwent similar changes in both language vari-
eties (in the period 1961–1991/2) in only two genres – C
(Press: Review) and E (Skills, Trades and Hobbies). The
number of genres in which LR reported a change in only
one of the two language varieties was significantly higher,
thus indicating different trends of change between these
two varieties in general. On one side we have genres A
(Press: Reportage), B (Press: Editorial), D (Religion), G
(Belles Lettres, Biographies, Essays), N (Adventure and
Western) and P (Romance and Love Story) for which the
results (Table 5) indicate a significant increase of LR in the
period 1961–1991 only in the British part of the corpora.
On the other side we have genre R (Humour) in which a
significant change (in this case a decrease) of LR was re-
ported only in American English.
5.2.4. Second vs. third approach
The investigation of diachronic changes of LR revealed the
same possible pitfalls in making conclusions solely based
on the results of the second approach (Table 6) as in the case
of LD (Section 5.1.4). For example, these results (Table
6) did not show any significant differences of LR between
1931 and 1961 in Fiction category, while the results of the
third approach (Table 5) indicated a significant decrease of
LR in genre N (Adventure and Western) and a significant
increase in genre R (Humour). In this case not only did
the results of the second approach fail to report significant
changes in some genres of the Fiction category, but even
more importantly, they failed to report that different genres
which belong to the same broad category, exhibit different
trends of change – increase and decrease, in the same period
of time.
In American English, the results of the second approach
(Table 6) did not indicate any changes of LR in the observed
period 1961–1992, while the results of the third approach
(Table 5) reported significant changes in one of the genres
in each of the Press, Prose and Fiction categories – gen-
res C (Press: Review), E (Skills, Trades and Hobbies) and
R (Humour). In the case of Prose category (in both peri-
ods, 1931–1961 and 1961–1991) and Fiction category (in
the period 1961–1991) in British English, the results of the
second approach (Table 6) which reported a significant in-
crease of LR were less misleading than in the previous case,
though still hiding the fact that these changes were present
only in certain genres of this category and not in all of them
(Table 5).
5.3. Synchronic comparison
The results of synchronic comparison of LD and LR be-
tween British and American English are presented in Ta-
ble 7. As LD and LR were already presented for both of
these language varieties in the previous two sections (5.1
and 5.2), here we presented only the genres in which a sta-
tistically significant difference between British and Amer-
ican English was reported for at least one feature and one
year.
It is interesting to note that the results (Table 7) did not re-
port any genre in which a significant difference of LD or LR
between these two language varieties was present in both
years – 1961 and 1991/2. Actually, in 1961, a significant
difference in LD and LR between British and American
was reported in only four genres – A (Press: Reportage),
B (Press: Editorial), K (General Fiction) and P (Romance
and Love Story). In all these genres, the texts written in
American English used a wider vocabulary than those writ-
ten in British English. In 1991/2, a significant difference of
LD between British and American English was reported in
only one genre – genre R (Humour). In this genre, texts
written in British English had a greater vocabulary vari-
ety than those written in American English. In the same
year (1991/2), LR was reported to be significantly higher in
British than in American English for two genres – genre G
(Belles Lettres, Biographies, Essays) and R (Humour).
It is also interesting to notice that all reported differences in
1961 went in favour of a larger vocabulary used in Ameri-
can English, while all those differences reported in 1991/2
went in favour of a larger vocabulary used in British En-
glish.
6. Conclusions
The results of the experiments presented in this paper en-
abled us to make two different types of relevant conclu-
sions. The first type of conclusions would be those re-
garding the investigated diachronic changes of lexical den-
sity and lexical richness and their behaviour in British and
American English. The second type would be those regard-
ing the influence of the chosen approach (chosen way of
exploitation of the comparable corpora) – using only four
main broad text categories (second approach) or using all
fifteen fine-grained text genres (third approach), on making
hypotheses about the way English language changes.
95
On the basis of the results of the third approach to the
investigation of diachronic changes of LD and LR (Ta-
bles 3 and 5), we can conclude that the changes of these
two stylistic features were very heterogeneous in various
ways – across the genres (A–R), language varieties (British
and American) and periods observed (1931–1961, 1961–
1991/2). Most importantly, these results indicated different
trends of change even among the genres which belong to
the same broad text category, e.g. genres N and P in Fiction
category reported a decrease and an increase of LD and LR
in the same period 1931–1961. Furthermore, the investi-
gated genres did not report many constant ongoing changes
during the two consecutive periods 1931–1961 and 1961–
1991. Genre N (Adventure and Western) reported a sig-
nificant decrease in the first period 1931–1961 and then a
significant increase of both features (LD and LR) in the sec-
ond period (1961–1991) in British English. In other genres,
a significant change was usually reported in only one of the
two observed periods. The only exceptions were noticed
in genre E (Skills, Trades and Hobbies), where LD and LR
had increased in both periods, and in genre G (Belles Let-
tres, Biographies, Essays), where LR reported a significant
increase during both periods.
Genre R (Humour) reported different behaviour between
the two language varieties (no change in British English
and a significant decrease in American English) for the
same period 1961–1991/2, and different behaviour in two
consecutive time periods in British English (an increase
in 1931–1961 and no significant change in 1961–1991).
Even more interestingly, the reported changes in British and
American English (although not for the same period, but for
1931–1961 in British and for 1961–1992 in American En-
glish) did not follow the same direction, i.e. in British En-
glish, LD and LR had increased (in the period 1931–1961),
while in American English, both of these features had de-
creased (in the period 1961–1992). Therefore, we cannot
even say that the changes reported in British and American
English were shifted in time (for thirty years). The results
presented in this study actually indicate that the changes of
LD and LR in British and American English were not mu-
tually influenced.
All these findings lead to the conclusion that the time gap
in diachronic studies of lexical density and lexical richness
should ideally be smaller if we wish to gain a better insight
into the way they change. They also indicate that different
language varieties should be investigated separately as they
generally do not follow the same patterns of change. Simi-
larly, the presented results emphasise the necessity for sep-
arate investigation of the genres which belong to the same
broad text category as they demonstrate different trends of
changes among themselves.
The comparison between the results obtained by using the
second approach (differentiating only across the four main
broad categories) and those obtained by using the third ap-
proach (differentiating across all fifteen fine-grained text
genres) clearly stated some of the potential pitfalls in mak-
ing hypotheses about the way language changes solely on
the basis of the results of the second approach. It pointed
out two possible problems in using the second approach.
The first problem would be the case in which the results of
the second approach do not report any changes in the rele-
vant text category, while a closer examination of the same
category (using the third approach) clearly indicates sig-
nificant changes in some of the genres belonging to that
category. The second problem would be the case in which
the results of the second approach again do not report any
changes, while the results of the third approach not only in-
dicate significant changes in some of the genres of that cat-
egory, but also indicate different trends of changes among
them (increase, decrease and no change). In the second ap-
proach these changes are probably masked by unbalanced
distribution of texts or by a high heterogeneity of changes
across different genres of that category.
Finally, this study presented various possibilities of the
comparable ‘Brown family’ of corpora and different ap-
proaches to their exploitation in diachronic and synchronic
language studies. Most of these ideas and the methodology
used could also be applied to other existing comparable cor-
pora in order to enable their better exploitation in various
tasks.
