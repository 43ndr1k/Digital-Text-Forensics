The ‘‘Fundamental Problem’’ of
Authorship Attribution
Moshe Koppel, Jonathan Schler, Shlomo Argamon and
Yaron Winter
We introduce the ‘‘fundamental problem’’ of authorship attribution: determining if two,
possibly short, documents were written by a single author. A solution to this problem can
serve as a building block for solving almost any conceivable authorship attribution
problem. Our preliminary work on this problem is based on earlier work in authorship
attribution with large open candidate sets.
1. Introduction
The simplest kind of authorship attribution problem—and the one that has received
the most attention—is the one in which we are given a small closed set of candidate
authors and are asked to attribute an anonymous text to one of them. Usually, it is
assumed that we have copious quantities of text by each candidate author and that
the anonymous text is reasonably long. A number of recent survey papers amply
cover the variety of methods used for solving this problem.1
Unfortunately, in the real world, we often encounter situations in which our list of
candidates might be very large and in which there is no guarantee that the true author
of an anonymous text is even among the candidates. Furthermore, the amount of
writing we have by each candidate might be very limited, and the anonymous text
itself might be short.
We therefore consider what we call the ‘‘fundamental problem’’ of authorship
attribution: given two (possibly short) documents, determine if they were written by
a single author or not. Plainly, if we can solve the fundamental problem, we can solve
any of the standard authorship attribution problems, whether in the idealized form
often considered or in the more difficult form typically encountered in real life.

The main idea is as follows. Given two input texts, X and Y, we generate a set of
impostors and then check if Y can be singled out from among the impostors as the
most likely author of X: that is, we use artificially generated impostors to reduce the
fundamental problem to that of authorship attribution on large open candidate sets.
We will describe our solution to this latter problem in some detail, drawing on our
recent work.2 We will then briefly sketch how that work can be adapted to solve the
fundamental problem.
2. Related Work
We have previously suggested a method known as ‘‘unmasking’’ for determining if
two book-length texts were written by the same author.3 Unfortunately, unmasking
does not work for short documents.4 The idea is that two texts are probably by
different authors if the differences between them are robust to changes in the
underlying feature set used to represent the documents. This principle proves to be
valuable in the method reported here as well.
As a rule, automated techniques for authorship attribution can be divided into two
main types.5 In similarity-based methods, some metric is used to measure the distance
between two documents, and an anonymous document is attributed to that author
whose known writing (considered collectively as a single document) is most similar.6
In machine-learning methods, the known writings of each candidate author
(considered as a set of distinct training documents) are used to construct a classifier
that can then be used to classify anonymous documents.7
Research in the similarity-based paradigm has focused on the choice of features for
document representation, on methods for dimensionality reduction (such as Principal
Components Analysis—PCA) of the feature space, and on the choice of distance
metric. Research in the machine-learning paradigm has focused on the choice of features
for document representation and on the choice of learning algorithms.
Virtually all of this work has focused on problems with a small number of
candidate authors. Recently, somewhat larger candidate sets have been considered by
David Madigan et al. (114 authors) and Kim Luyckx and Walter Daelemans (145
authors).8 Moshe Koppel et al. have considered candidate sets including thousands of
authors.9 Both Koppel et al. and Luyckx and Daelemans observed that when there are
very many candidate authors, similarity-based methods are more appropriate than
machine-learning methods.10

For this reason, our approach here is in the similarity-based paradigm, so we
devote a few words to its main principles. The basic idea is that the most reasonable
attribution can be found by viewing each document as a point in some
multidimensional space, and assigning a questioned document to the author whose
documents as a whole are ‘‘closest’’, according to some appropriate distance measure.
There are a number of reasonable such distance measures that have been applied to
the problem. A popular such method is Burrows’s Delta,11 which, with extensions,
has been used for a variety of attribution problems;12 it amounts to an approximate
probabilistic ranking based on a multidimensional Laplacian distribution over word
frequencies.13 Many other similarity functions have been applied to different feature
sets as well.14
Just as most work in authorship attribution has focused on tasks with small
numbers of candidate authors, almost all work has also focused on the case in which
the candidate set is closed, that is, the anonymous text is assumed to have been
written by one of the known candidates. The more general case, in which the true
author of an anonymous text might not be one of the known candidates, reduces in
the simplest case to the binary authorship verification problem: determine if the given
document was written by a specific author or not. The authorship verification
problem has usually been considered in the context of plagiarism analysis.15
The general authorship attribution problem, where candidate sets are simulta-
neously large and open was recently considered by Moshe Koppel, Jonathan Schler,
and Shlomo Argamon.16 In what follows we present the main results of that paper, as
they relate to the problem at hand.
3. Handling Large Open Candidate Sets
We use a set of ten thousand blogs harvested in August 2004 from blogger.com. The
corpus is balanced for gender within each of a number of age intervals. In addition,
each individual blog is predominantly in English and contains sufficient text, as will
be explained. For each blog, we choose two thousand words of known text and a
snippet, consisting of the last five hundred words of the blog, such that the posts from
which the known text and the snippet are taken are disjoint. Our object will be to
determine which—if any—of the authors of the known texts is the author of a given
snippet.
We will experiment using various subsets of the available text to determine the
impact on the attribution of the number of candidates.

We begin by representing each text (both known texts and snippets) as a vector
representing the respective frequencies of each space-free character 4-gram. For our
purposes, a space-free character 4-gram is (a) a string of characters of length four
that includes no spaces or (b) a string of four or fewer characters surrounded by
spaces. In our corpus, there are just over 250,000 unique (but overlapping) space-
free character 4-grams. We select the 100,000 such features most frequent in the
corpus as our feature universe. Character n-grams have been shown to be effective
for authorship attribution17 and have the advantage of being measurable in any
language without specialized background knowledge.
It is not practical to learn a single classifier for ten thousand classes, nor is it
practical to learn ten thousand one-versus-all binary classifiers. Instead, we use a
similarity-based method. Specifically, we use a common straightforward information
retrieval method to assign an author to a given snippet. Using cosine similarity as a
proximity measure, we simply return the author whose known writing (considered as
a single vector of space-free character 4-gram frequencies) is most similar to the
snippet vector.18 Testing this rather naı̈ve method on one thousand snippets selected
at random from among the ten thousand authors, we find that 46 per cent of the
snippets are correctly assigned.
While this is perhaps surprisingly high, a precision of 46 per cent is inadequate for
most applications. To remedy this problem, we adopt the approach of Koppel et al.,19
which permits a response of Don’t Know in cases where attribution is uncertain. The
objective is to obtain high precision for those cases where an answer is given, while
trying to offer an answer as often as possible.
The key to our new approach is the same as the underlying principle of
‘‘unmasking’’.20 The known text of a snippet’s actual author is likely to be the text
most similar to the snippet even as we vary the feature set that we use to represent
the texts. Another author’s text might happen to be the most similar for one or a
few specific feature sets, but it is highly unlikely to be consistently so over many
different feature sets.
This observation suggests using the following algorithm:
Given: snippet of length L1; known-texts of length L2 for each of C candidates
1. Repeat k1 times
a. Randomly choose some fraction k2 of the full feature set
b. Find top match using cosine similarity
2. For each candidate author A,
a. Score(A)¼ proportion of times A is top match
Output: arg maxA Score(A) if max Score(A)4 s*; else Don’t Know

The idea is to check if a given author proves to be most similar to the test snippet
for many different randomly selected feature sets of fixed size. The number of
different feature sets used (k1) and the fraction of all possible features in each such set
(k2) are parameters that need to be selected. The threshold s* serves as the minimal
score an author needs to be deemed the actual author. We vary this parameter to
obtain a trade-off between recall and precision.
We note that our method is similar in many respects to classifier ensemble
methods in which different classifiers are learned using different subsets of features.21
4. Results
We set the number of iterations (k1) to 100, the snippet length (L1) to 500, the
known-text length for each candidate (L2) to 2,000, and the fraction of available
features used in the feature set (k2) to 40 per cent. We consider how the number of
candidate authors affects precision and recall. In Figure 1, we show recall-precision
curves for various numbers of candidate authors. Note that, as expected, accuracy
increases as the number of candidate authors diminishes. We mark on each curve the
point s*¼ .90. For example, for 1,000 candidates, at s*¼ .90, we achieve 93.2 per
cent precision at 39.3 per cent recall.
We now consider the possibility that none of the candidate authors is the actual
author of the snippet. What we would hope to find is that in such cases the method
does not attribute the snippet to any of the candidates.
In fact, testing on 1,000 snippets that belong to none of the candidates, we find that
at s*¼ .90 very few are mistakenly attributed to one of the candidate authors: 2.5 per
cent for 10,000 candidates, 3.5 per cent for 5,000 and 5.5 per cent for 1,000. Perhaps
counter-intuitively, for snippets by authors not among the candidates, having fewer
candidates actually makes the problem more difficult since the fewer competing
candidates there are, the more likely it is that there is some consistently most similar
(but inevitably wrong) candidate.

5. The Fundamental Problem of Authorship Attribution
The above method can serve as the basis for solving what we call the ‘‘fundamental
problem’’ of authorship attribution: given two (possibly short) documents,
determine if the two documents were written by the same author or two different
authors. Plainly, if we can solve this problem, we can solve the standard attribution
problems considered above, as well as almost any authorship attribution problem we
can conceive of.
Our approach to solving the fundamental problem is as follows. Given two texts, X
and Y, we generate a set of impostors (Y1, . . ., Yn) and then use the above method to
determine if X was written by Y or any of the impostors or by none of them. If and
only if we obtain that X was written by Y with a sufficiently high score, we say that the
two documents are by a single author. (Clearly, we can additionally, or alternatively,
generate impostors X1, . . ., Xn and compare them to Y.)
The questions that we need to explore in order to adapt the above method to our
problem are the following:
. How many impostors should be used?
. How should the impostors be chosen?
. What score should we require in order to conclude that two documents are by a
single author?
We report here for the first time preliminary answers to these questions based on
recently concluded experiments.
Using a development set consisting of 500 pairs of blog posts written by a single
author and 500 pairs written by two different authors, we restricted our potential
impostor universe to other blog posts. (This restriction is simply a matter of
convenience; we don’t claim it is optimal.) Given a pair5X, Y4, we found that the
best way to choose actual impostors Y1, . . ., Yn from this universe, is as follows.
Identify the 250 most similar blog posts to Y. (This ensures that the impostors at least
roughly resemble Y.) Then randomly choose twenty-five blog posts from among
these to serve as impostors.
Using this protocol on an independent test set, we assign5X, Y4 to a single
author if and only if Y is selected from among the set {Y, Y1, . . ., Yn} as most similar
to X in at least eleven trials out of one hundred. We found that we obtain precision of
90 per cent and recall of 83 per cent.
We believe that these results suggest that the fundamental problem of authorship is
a solvable problem.
6. Conclusions
We leverage our work on authorship attribution with large open candidate sets to
propose a method for solving what we call the ‘‘fundamental problem’’ of authorship

attribution: determining if two, possibly short, documents were written by the same
author. The key is to properly choose an impostor set. Our method for choosing the
set is to identify some relevant universe, then choose a large set of potential impostors
that are sufficiently similar to the input documents, and finally randomly choose
twenty-five impostors from among that set. The identification of a ‘‘relevant
universe’’ requires further study, but in preliminary experiments we have found that
it is sufficient to simply generate the universe by using results of Google searches on
queries randomly selected from the input documents.
By varying the threshold for identifying an input pair as being by the same author,
we control the trade-off between precision and recall. We have found that even when
we insist on precision of 90 per cent (as we must, for example, in forensic
applications), we obtain recall above 80 per cent. These results seem to be a very
promising basis for future investigations.
