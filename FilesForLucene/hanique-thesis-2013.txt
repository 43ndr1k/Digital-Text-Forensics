Introduction
Chapter 1
Everyday conversational speech is characterized by extensive variation in the pro-
nunciations of words. One type of variation is due to the acoustic reduction of words:
words are often not produced as their full forms with all segments carefully pro-
nounced, but as reduced forms with altered, shortened, or even absent segments.
For instance, the English word apparently has the full form /@phE~R@ntli/, but may
be pronounced as [phE~Ri] or [phE~] (Johnson, 2004). Similarly, in Dutch, the word
natuurlijk ‘of course’ may be pronounced as for instance [ntyrl@k], [tyl@k], or [tyk] in-
stead of /natyrl@k/ (Ernestus, 2000). These reduction phenomena occur frequently:
for conversational American English, Johnson (2004) showed that in six percent of
all content words at least one syllable is absent and that over sixty percent of all
words deviate from their full forms. In the Ernestus Corpus of Spontaneous Dutch
(Ernestus, 2000), high reduction rates have also been found, that is, over forty per-
cent of words are not produced in their full form and almost twenty percent of words
are missing a syllable (Schuppler, Ernestus, Scharenborg, & Boves, 2011). Already
in the eighties, Mehta & Cutler (1988) showed that the comprehension of conver-
sational speech makes very different demands than the comprehension of carefully
articulated, read aloud speech. This dissertation investigates how speakers and lis-
teners process acoustic reductions in casual Dutch. The studies in this dissertation
are based on and will help improve models of speech production and speech com-
prehension. In particular, they address the question how words are represented in
the mental lexicon. Furthermore, these studies examine the processing of reduction
phenomena by means of different quantitative and experimental methods.
Psycholinguistic models
Psycholinguistic models range on a continuum from purely abstractionist models to
entirely exemplar-based models, and differ mostly in their assumptions about the
number of lexical representations per word and the amount of detailed information
stored in the mental lexicon.
Abstractionist models (e.g., Chomsky & Halle, 1968; Levelt, Roelofs, & Meyer,
1999; Pinker, 1991) assume that the pronunciations of words are represented in the
mental lexicon as strings of abstract phonological units, for instance, as strings of
1
Chapter 1
Introduction
phonemes. The far end of the continuum is represented by abstractionist models
assuming that for each word the mental lexicon stores exactly one pronunciation.
Hence, the word apparently has one phonological representation, although it may
be pronounced in various ways. A pronunciation that differs from the stored repre-
sentation results from the application of general phonetic and phonological rules to
this stored representation. During speech comprehension, these rules are reversed
to map a reduced pronunciation onto the stored abstract representation. Rules may
state that a given segment may be adapted or deleted in a certain phonological con-
text. For instance, there may be a rule stating that schwa might be deleted in the
Dutch word /x@won/ gewoon ‘just’.
At a less extreme point on the continuum, abstractionist models assume that the
mental lexicon stores multiple pronunciation variants for each word. According to
these models, each pronunciation variant is recognized via its own abstract repre-
sentation. The production of a word with absent segments may result from two types
of processes. On the one hand, speakers may select a word’s full form and reduce
it during articulation, which results in shortened and, in extreme cases, absent seg-
ments (Browman & Goldstein, 1990). Importantly, the shortening and absence of a
segment then result from the same gradient process. On the other hand, speakers
may retrieve a pronunciation variant with missing segments from the mental lexicon.
The missing segments are then always completely (categorically) absent.
Exemplar-based models (e.g., Bybee, 2001, p. 35; Goldinger, 1998) assume the
storage of all occurrences of a word that a language user has ever pronounced or
heard. Most or all of these occurrences are stored in the form of exemplars, which
are acoustically detailed representations. Exemplars representing the same word to-
gether form one cloud. The pronunciation of a word results from the retrieval of one or
the average of multiple exemplars that represent a certain pronunciation variant. The
recognition of a word occurs by mapping a pronunciation onto a cloud of exemplars.
Abstractionist and exemplar-based models are combined in hybrid models, located
in the middle of the continuum (e.g., Goldinger, 2007; Hawkins, 2003; McLennan,
Luce, & Charles-Luce, 2003; Pierrehumbert, 2002). They combine the advantages
of abstractionist and exemplar-based models by assuming that words are stored with
both abstract representations and exemplars. The various versions of hybrid models
differ in the exact roles of the two types of representations during production and
recognition, and how these representations interact. As hybrid models are currently
accepted by many researchers and as the literature provides evidence for both ab-
stract representations and exemplars, this dissertation is based on this type of model.
Evidence for multiple representations
Several studies have found support for the assumption that at least some words are
represented with more than one pronunciation variant in the mental lexicon. Two
studies focusing on speech comprehension report that a pronunciation variant is re-

cognized more accurately and quickly if this variant occurs more often. Pitt, Dilley, &
Tat (2011) showed this for the comprehension of English words with a word-medial
/t/ that was produced as [t], [R], or [P], or was absent. Ranbom & Connine (2007)
showed this for the comprehension of American English words with /nt/ that are pro-
nounced with a nasal flap (e.g., [dZẼRl] /dZEntl/ gentle). Since the variant frequencies
play a role in speech comprehension, they must be represented in the mental lexi-
con. The authors of the two papers assume that the frequencies are stored with the
full and reduced pronunciation variants themselves. An alternative assumption is that
the variant frequencies specify how often each word’s full form is subject to (a series
of) reduction processes. The mental lexicon then specifies how often the full form
occurs and how often all its variants occur. This latter assumption is experimentally
indistinguishable from the first assumption.
Research on speech production has also provided data supporting the assump-
tion that pronunciation variants are stored in the mental lexicon. Bürki, Ernestus, &
Frauenfelder (2010) showed that the frequency of a pronunciation variant not only
affects comprehension but also production speed. This study was based on French
words with word-medial schwa that participants produced in isolation or that were pre-
ceded by possessive determiners, with or without schwa (e.g., [S@miz] versus [Smiz]
chemise ‘shirt’). A number of studies have adopted a different method. The reason
is that a role for variant frequency in speech production can only unambiguously be
demonstrated if words are produced in isolation or very short clauses (as in Bürki et
al., 2010), but most reduced pronunciation variants only occur in the middle of longer
sentences. These studies argue that if a pronunciation variant is stored in the mental
lexicon, the absence of a segment is not necessarily the result of extreme shortening.
As a consequence, a variant with an absent segment may occur under conditions that
do not favor this segment’s shortening. Differences in conditions have been found on
the basis of words extracted from corpora of spontaneous speech, for example, the
absence of French word-internal schwa, as in [Smiz] /S@miz/ chemise ‘shirt’ (Bürki,
Ernestus, Gendrot, Fougeron, & Frauenfelder, 2011), and the absence of /e/ in the
word combination [stE] /setE/ c’était ‘it was’ (Torreira & Ernestus, 2011).
There is also clear counter-evidence for the assumption that reduced pronuncia-
tion variants are stored in the lexicon: extremely reduced words are often difficult
to recognize without any context (Ernestus, Baayen, & Schreuder, 2002). However,
this observation can also be explained by the assumption that lexical representations
include information about the phonological or semantic context in which the variant
occurs (Hawkins, 2003). Representations can only be accessed if the variant occurs
in the specified context. If it does not, for instance because it is artificially presented
out of context, the variant cannot be processed via this representation.
With the exception of Pitt et al. (2011), the studies described above investigated
reduction of highly frequent word combinations (Torreira & Ernestus, 2011) and phe-
nomena that are frequent in casual, connected speech as well as in formal speech
or in isolated words (Bürki et al., 2010; Bürki, Ernestus, et al., 2011; Ranbom & Con-
3

Introduction
nine, 2007). There are, however, many reduction processes that affect many differ-
ent word types and that are restricted to casual, connected speech. The question
arises whether the pronunciation variants resulting from these reduction processes
are stored in the mental lexicon as well. If so, the lexicon contains many more pro-
nunciation representations than assumed by most abstractionist models. Pitt et al.
(2011) investigated this question by examining how listeners recognize words with
medial /t/ in American English. He presented listeners with these words out of their
natural context. In Chapters 2 and 3 of this dissertation, we further address this ques-
tion by studying words within their context. These chapters focus on the realization of
schwa in prefixes and word-final /t/ in Dutch past participles within context (e.g., in
/x@lœyst@rt/ geluisterd ‘listened’). The reduction of these segments occurs in many
different word types but is restricted to casual, connected speech. Like Bürki, Ernes-
tus, et al. (2011) and Torreira & Ernestus (2011), in both chapters, we investigate the
production of reduced segments by comparing the conditions of segment shortening
and segment absence.
Evidence for exemplars
Several researchers have argued that the mental lexicon stores many exemplars for
each word. Johnson (1997), for instance, argued that with exemplars we can account
for how listeners adapt to different speakers without assuming a process of speaker
normalization. A few years later, Johnson (2004) argued that models with abstract
representations or with a single representation for each word cannot account for pro-
nunciations with gradient reductions, and that models therefore have to represent
words as clouds of exemplars. Finally, Port (2007) argued that acoustically detailed
lexical representations are necessary to account for, among other things, how the
pronunciations of some words gradually change over time.
Several series of experiments have investigated how exemplars may affect speech
processing. Goldinger (1998), for instance, performed shadowing experiments, show-
ing that listeners often mimic the acoustic detail of the stimulus, which implies that
participants must have stored this acoustic detail during the comprehension process.
Furthermore, several researchers studied the role of exemplars in speech compre-
hension by means of long-term identity priming experiments. In these experiments,
the first occurrence of a word (the prime) was acoustically identical to or different from
the second occurrence (the target): primes and targets were produced by the same
speaker or different speakers, represented the same or a different realization of a
certain segment (e.g., intervocalic /t,d/ produced as [t,d] or as a flap), or were pro-
duced at the same or a different speech rate (e.g., Bradlow, Nygaard, & Pisoni, 1999;
Craik & Kirsner, 1974; Goh, 2005; Goldinger, 1996; Mattys & Liss, 2008; McLennan
et al., 2003; McLennan & Luce, 2005; Palmeri, Goldinger, & Pisoni, 1993). If a prime
creates an exemplar, priming effects should be larger if a prime and target are highly
similar. In contrast, if both occurrences of a word are processed via the same single
4

abstract representation, the size of the priming effect should be independent of the
detailed acoustic similarity between the prime and target. Most experiments demon-
strated that priming effects are larger if primes and targets are identical, suggesting
that acoustic details are stored in the form of exemplars.
Interestingly, some of these priming experiments suggested that exemplar-based
priming effects only arise under certain conditions, but not consistently. For example,
McLennan et al. (2003) found exemplar effects but only if processing was relatively
fast, whereas McLennan & Luce (2005) and Mattys & Liss (2008) found effects only
if processing was relatively slow. Similarly, Goldinger (1996) reported that if the parti-
cipants had to indicate for each target whether it had also occurred before, exemplar
effects were present after a day if they had heard stimuli produced by two or ten voices
but not by six voices. This raises the question about how robust exemplar effects are.
In Chapter 4, we investigate this question further. It focuses on schwa in Dutch
word-initial syllables, which is often reduced in casual speech (see Chapter 2). Chap-
ter 4 presents four long-term priming experiments, in which we study the robustness
of exemplars in three ways. First, we examine whether exemplar effects arise for dif-
ferent speakers, by using two very different speakers. Second, we investigate whether
listeners also use exemplars if, in contrast to the priming studies mentioned above,
it is less clear for them that words are repeated. Finally, we examine whether exem-
plar effects can also be found if listeners hear not one but two types of variation (i.e.,
pronunciation variation and speaker voice).
Morphology
A large proportion of reduced words are morphologically complex, as this type of
word often contains unstressed syllables that can be easily reduced. A long-standing
debate on complex words concerns the question of whether they are stored in the
mental lexicon, which affects the production and comprehension process. Accord-
ing to some theories (e.g., Chomsky & Halle, 1968; Pinker, 1991; Taft & Ardasinski,
2006), the mental lexicon only stores irregular complex words and the processing
of regular ones involves combining their morphemes. Other theories (e.g., Bybee,
2001; Skousen, 1989) assume that complex words are stored. These words are then
processed like simple words and the two word types should show similar behavior.
Finally, several theories combine the two ways of storing and processing words (e.g.,
Levelt et al., 1999; Schreuder & Baayen, 1995).
Many studies have investigated whether morphological structure plays a role in lan-
guage processing. If so, this would support the assumption that morphologically com-
plex words are processed via their morphemes. Most studies focused on reading, but
several investigated speech processing (e.g., Bybee, 1995; Cohen-Goldberg, 2013;
Marslen-Wilson & Zhou, 1999; Seidenberg & Gonnerman, 2000; Taft, 2004). So far,
findings are mixed. The study by Cohen-Goldberg (2013), for example, reported an
effect in speech production. This researcher showed that there is competition be-
5

Introduction
tween phones in English words when they are read aloud in isolation, but that this
competition appears smaller if the phones are separated by a morpheme boundary.
The author therefore argued that morphologically complex words are processed via
their morphemes, at least during reading.
If morphology is important in speech processing, it should also influence acoustic
reduction. In the literature, a number of studies are found that support this idea, as
they, for example, indicate that segments forming an affix on their own tend to be
less reduced than when the same segments are part of a longer morpheme. This
has been reported for several word-final segments in English, namely for /t/ and /d/,
as in rapped versus rapt (Bybee, 2002; Guy, 1994; Labov, 2004; Losiewicz, 1992;
Sugahara & Turk, 2009), for /s/, as in tacks versus tax (Schwarzlose & Bradlow,
2001; Sugahara & Turk, 2009), and for /IN,In/, as in raising versus raisin (Sugahara &
Turk, 2009). Additionally, this has been found for Dutch word-final /t/, as in /bit/ biedt
‘offers’ versus /bit/ bied ‘offer’ (Schuppler, Van Dommelen, Koreman, & Ernestus,
2012).
Chapter 5 of this dissertation presents a review of articles that have reported effects
of a word’s morphological structure on reduction. We discuss and re-analyze data
(amongst others, from Losiewicz, 1992, and Schuppler et al., 2012), and address
the question whether the effects reported can also be explained by the assumption
that segments that are more important for the identification of a word (i.e., that have
a higher information load) are less reduced, independently of their morphological
status.
Individual differences
So far, psycholinguistic theories have been designed to account for speech process-
ing in the ideal or average language user and do not account for differences among
users. Nevertheless, there is evidence that speakers differ in how often and to what
extent they reduce words in casual speech.
First, several studies on socio-linguistics have shown that social groups may differ
in their reductions. In general, younger speakers reduce more than older speakers.
This has been reported, for instance, for the absence of word-final /t/ and /d/ in Ame-
rican English (Guy, 1980), the absence of segments in Dutch (Strik, Van Doremalen,
& Cucciarini, 2008), and the production of /t/ as [S] in Panama Spanish (Cedergren,
1987). Furthermore, men tend to reduce more than women, which has been shown
for the absence of word-final /t/ and /d/ (Guy, 1980) and glides (Phillips, 1994) in
American English, and for the reduction of suffix -lijk in Dutch (as in /mox@l@k/ mo-
gelijk ‘possibly’; Keune, Ernestus, Van Hout, & Baayen, 2005). Finally, the Dutch
suffix -lijk is less often reduced by speakers from Flanders than speakers from the
Netherlands, and by highly educated Flemish speakers compared to less highly edu-
cated Flemish speakers (Keune et al., 2005).
6
Mental representation and processing of reduced words in casual speech
Second, speakers forming a homogeneous social group may also differ in how
they reduce words. However, the evidence for individual differences is scarce, as it
only comes from Ernestus (2000, p. 143). In her corpus of spontaneous Dutch, she
observed that multiple speakers used the pronunciation [tyk] for /natyrl@k/ natuurlijk
‘of course’ in the middle of Intonational Phrases, but only one of the twenty speakers
also used it in other positions and even in isolation.
In Chapter 6, we investigate whether individual speakers with a similar social back-
ground differ in which words they produce and how they reduce them. We study
whether a classifier can distinguish between speakers on the basis of words and pro-
nunciation patterns in spontaneous speech. If so, the speakers have to differ in the
words and pronunciations they produce. In addition, we inspect which words and
pronunciations are relevant for the classifier and thus display differences between
speakers.
Methodology
The studies described in this dissertation use a range of research methods. In Chap-
ters 2 and 6, we investigate the speech production process by analyzing several hours
of casual conversations recorded by Ernestus (2000). She placed the speakers in
front of a microphone, which often leads to unnatural speech, but since the speakers
knew each other very well and talked about everyday topics, they quickly habituated
to the situation, forgot the microphone, and spoke very casually. As a result, the
speech recorded represents casual, spontaneous conversations, which allows us to
study speech as it occurs in everyday life. We analyzed the conversations using two
different methods: Chapter 2 presents analyses on the basis of regression models,
while Chapter 6 concerns a classification study.
The segments, words, and phrases produced in casual conversations often differ
from each other in the speech rate at which they were uttered, in their position in
the sentence, in the preceding and following segments, etcetera. Segments, words,
or phrases therefore never differ from each other in only one aspect, which makes it
difficult to investigate why exactly these units differ from each other in the way they
do. To investigate the effect of a factor of interest (e.g., word frequency), corpus
studies should preferably be complemented with psycholinguistic experiments that
manipulate this one factor and control for all other factors.
It is still not clear how casual speech can easily be elicited in psycholinguistic ex-
periments. Chapter 3 presents a production experiment in which participants re-
peated sentences that they heard. This shadowing task enabled us to elicit the same
words from almost all the participants, and to control for the target words’ positions
in the sentences and their preceding and following phones. We address the ques-
tion whether this task provides natural casual speech, by comparing patterns in the
speech elicited with patterns in natural casual conversations reported in Chapter 2.
Highly similar results would not only show that the speech obtained with the shadow-

Introduction
ing task is natural; it would also strengthen our conclusions based on the corpus data
in Chapter 2.
This dissertation also reports a series of psycholinguistic experiments studying the
comprehension of reduced pronunciation variants. Previous studies have investigated
the comprehension of reduced pronunciation variants by means of several paradigms,
including cross-model priming, lexical decision, implicit semantic priming, and iden-
tification tasks, in which words were presented in isolation (Tucker & Warner, 2007;
Tucker, 2011; Van de Ven, Tucker, & Ernestus, 2011; Warner, Fountain, & Tucker,
2009). Since reduced pronunciation variants typically occur within sentence context,
these experiments do not present these variants in their natural environment, which
may affect speech processing. Bard, Shillcock, & Altmann (1988) and Van de Ven,
Ernestus, & Schreuder (2012) presented reduced pronunciation variants in their con-
text, but in experiments providing offline measures only (i.e., gating and cloze tests).
Finally, Brouwer and colleagues (e.g., Brouwer, Mitterer, & Heuttig, 2012) also pre-
sented the words in their natural context, in a visual world paradigm with printed
words. These printed words may have activated the full pronunciations of the words,
possibly affecting the speech comprehension process. This overview shows that we
are still in need of an experimental paradigm that presents reduced pronunciation
variants in their natural context, without presenting their orthographic forms and pro-
viding online measures.
The comprehension experiments of Chapter 4 focus on a question that has been
addressed before for several types of pronunciation variation (e.g., speaker voice or
/nt/ produced as a flap; Goldinger, 1996; McLennan et al., 2003). We chose to use
the same paradigm as these previous studies, that is, the long-term identity priming
paradigm, since this appears to be the best paradigm to investigate this question.
Unfortunately, this implied that we presented reduced pronunciation variants out of
context.
In this dissertation, we report on the presence versus absence and the durations
of segments in a large number of word tokens. We chose not to segment the word
tokens by hand, since we would then not be able to study a very large number of
word tokens. Moreover, the resulting segmentation may be subjective and inconsis-
tent. Instead, we used an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system to transcribe
and segment the word tokens. This ASR system is based on the Hidden Markov
Model Toolkit (HTK; Young et al., 2002) and uses four types of input: the speech sig-
nal itself, orthographic transcriptions of the speech, a pronunciation lexicon that, for
each word in the transcriptions (e.g., natuurlijk ‘of course’), provides the full phonetic
form (/natyrl@k/) and possible pronunciation variants (amongst others, /ntyl@k/ and
/tyk/), and 37 three-state monophone acoustic models, with 32 Gaussians per state
(Hämäläinen, Gubian, ten Bosch, & Boves, 2009). These phone models were trained
on the read speech component from the Spoken Dutch Corpus (Oostdijk, 2002) and
were used to determine, for each word in the orthographic transcriptions, which pro-
nunciation variant from the lexicon best matched the speech signal. As we report

in Chapters 2, 3, and 6, the resulting transcriptions and word segmentations are as
reliable as transcriptions created by human listeners.
Outline
This dissertation presents five studies investigating how speakers and listeners pro-
cess acoustic reductions in casual Dutch. Chapters 2 and 3 focus on speech produc-
tion. In these chapters, we investigate whether schwa and word-final /t/ are more
likely to be absent under conditions that also favor shortening of these segments. If
so, the absence of these segments may result from extreme gradient reduction. If not,
the segments may also be absent in the pronunciations stored in the mental lexicon,
which would support models assuming that words are stored with multiple pronunci-
ation representations. The research described in Chapter 2 concerns speech from
a corpus of casual Dutch and the work reported in Chapter 3 concerns speech ob-
tained from a shadowing experiment. Comparison of the results of these chapters
sheds light on the question whether casual speech can be elicited in an experimental
setting (see Chapters 3 and 7).
In Chapters 4, 5, and 6, we further investigate the processes underlying the produc-
tion and comprehension of reduced pronunciation variants. Chapter 4 reports a study
on the role of exemplars in speech comprehension. It focuses on schwa reduction in
Dutch and presents four experiments with a long-term identity priming paradigm. The
work in Chapter 5 concerns the role of morphological structure in speech reduction. It
provides a review and re-analyses of data from papers, which argue that morphologi-
cal structure is relevant. In this chapter, we examine whether the reported effects can
also be explained by the hypothesis that segments that are more important for word
identification tend to be less reduced. In Chapter 6, we investigate to what extent
speakers differ in the words that they use and in how they pronounce these words.
This chapter focuses on recordings of casual speech produced by twenty speakers
with a similar social background.
In Chapter 7, we summarize and discuss the results of these five studies. We
focus on what these studies have taught us about how to investigate the produc-
tion and comprehension of reduced pronunciation variants. Moreover, we look at
the implications of the results for psycholinguistic models of speech production and
comprehension.

Abstract
This chapter investigates the nature of reduction phenomena in informal speech. It
addresses the question whether reduction processes that affect many word types,
but only if they occur in connected informal speech, may be categorical in nature.
The focus is on reduction of schwa in the prefixes and on word-final /t/ in Dutch past
participles. More than 2000 tokens of past participles from the Ernestus Corpus of
Spontaneous Dutch and the Spoken Dutch Corpus (both from the interview and read
speech component) were transcribed automatically. The results demonstrate that the
presence and duration of /t/ are affected by approximately the same phonetic vari-
ables, indicating that the absence of /t/ is the extreme result of shortening, and thus
results from a gradient reduction process. Also for schwa, the data show that mainly
phonetic variables influence its reduction, but its presence is affected by different and
more variables than its duration, which suggests that the absence of schwa may re-
sult from gradient as well as categorical processes. These conclusions are supported
by the distributions of the segments’ durations. These findings provide evidence that
reduction phenomena which affect many words in informal conversations may also
result from categorical reduction processes.

Chapter 2
Processes underlying acoustic reduction: a corpus study
Introduction
In conversational speech, words are often not produced in their full forms, that is
in the form that is used in formal situations (e.g., Ernestus, 2000; Johnson, 2004).
Segments may be very short, altered (e.g., a voiced plosive may be pronounced as
a glide), or even be completely absent. The English word particular, for example,
has the full form /p@tIkj@l@~/, but in conversational speech may also be produced
as /ptIk@~/. Similarly, the Dutch word gewenst ‘wished’ may be produced as /xwEns/
instead of /x@wEnst/. Recently, researchers have started to investigate the processes
underlying this type of pronunciation variation. This chapter contributes to this line
of research by studying the processes underlying the two most frequent reduction
phenomena in Dutch, which affect many words but only if they occur within a sentence
in informal speech.
Browman & Goldstein (1990) hypothesized that all pronunciation variants that typi-
cally occur in casual speech result from a gradient increase in overlap and a gradient
decrease in the magnitude of articulatory gestures. Gestural overlap may result in
blending if two neighboring segments share an articulator. One or both segments
are then pronounced incompletely. An example of this blending process is the pro-
nunciation of English this shop as /DIS:6p/, with a long /S/, but without /s/. Gestural
overlap may result in the complete hiding of a segment if two neighboring segments
are pronounced with different articulators. For instance, the closure of a bilabial stop
may hide a preceding /t/ by making the release of the alveolar constriction inaudible.
Browman and Goldstein found support for their hypothesis in several articulatory
studies (see Browman & Goldstein, 1992, for an overview). In addition, their hypothe-
sis is supported by several acoustic studies. Davidson (2006) for instance, studied
the absence of pretonic schwa in consonant-schwa-consonant sequences in Ameri-
can English (e.g., in the words tomato and support). She found that schwa is less
often absent if the preceding segment is voiced or is a voiceless stop which can only
overlap partially with schwa. In addition, if schwa is absent in /#s@p/ sequences,
/p/ is often aspirated, which suggests that the articulatory gestures for schwa are
still present. Furthermore, Davidson (2006) also showed that preceding voiceless
fricatives and following /l/s tend to be longer if schwa is absent. All these results
indicate that the absence of schwa in the acoustic signal is due to co-articulation with
surrounding consonants.
Another acoustic study supporting Browman and Goldstein’s hypothesis was con-
ducted by Torreira & Ernestus (2010b). They studied vowel devoicing in French, a
reduction phenomenon that is mostly restricted to fast and casual speech. They
showed that partial devoicing is affected by the same predictors as complete devoic-
ing (speech rate, manner of articulation of the preceding consonant, distance to the
following Accentual Phrase boundary). These results suggest that both partial and
complete devoicing result from the same reduction process, which is consequently
gradient in nature.
12
Mental representation and processing of reduced words in casual speech
The pronunciation variants resulting from co-articulation may be stored in the men-
tal lexicon. These representations then have to specify the acoustic details of the
variants, for instance the exact durations of their segments. They therefore differ from
the abstract representations in the form of phonemes, which are assumed by most
models of speech production (e.g., Levelt et al., 1999). Since gradient reduction by
definition results in a continuum of pronunciation variants, the storage of these vari-
ants also implies a complex mental lexicon.
Importantly, several authors assume that the absence of segments may not only
result from gradient processes, but also from categorical higher-level processes. One
such categorical process is a phonological rule that deletes a segment completely
(e.g., Chomsky & Halle, 1968; McCarthy & Prince, 1993). In addition, the mental
lexicon may contain representations for multiple pronunciations of a word (e.g., Gol-
dinger, 1998), and the absence of a segment may result from the selection of a variant
with missing segments.
Support for the categorical nature of some reduction phenomena has been found in
corpus-based and psycholinguistic studies. For instance, Torreira & Ernestus (2011)
studied the processes underlying /e/-reduction in the highly frequent word combina-
tion c’était /setE/ ‘it was’ using the Nijmegen Corpus of Casual French. The duration
of /s(e)/ showed a bimodal distribution instead of a unimodal distribution, with one
mode containing most tokens with /e/ and the other containing most tokens without
/e/. Furthermore, the presence and duration of /e/ were conditioned by different vari-
ables: whereas the presence of /e/ was conditioned by speech rate and the distance
to the end of the Accentual Phrase, the duration of /e/ was conditioned by position
in the Intonational Phrase and the duration of preceding /s/. Given these results, the
authors concluded that the absence and shortening of /e/ can result from different
processes, and that the absence of /e/ in French c’était sometimes results from a
categorical process rather than from extreme vowel shortening.
Bürki and colleagues investigated the nature of word-internal schwa deletion in
French. This deletion phenomenon is very frequent in many varieties of French
and can also occur in formal speech and when words are uttered without context.
Bürki, Fougeron, Gendrot, & Frauenfelder (2011) showed that this schwa deletion
phenomenon can result from a gradient shortening process, as the duration of schwa
varies from very long to very short, like the duration of other vowels. In addition,
it can result from categorical processes; Bürki et al. (2010) demonstrated in seve-
ral production studies that speakers of French produce a pronunciation variant (e.g.,
fenêtre) faster the more frequent it is in comparison with the other variant (e.g., fnêtre),
which suggests that both variants are stored. In a corpus study, Bürki, Ernestus, et
al. (2011) found differences between the sets of variables that condition word-internal
schwa duration and its absence. Schwa duration was influenced by voicing of the
preceding and following consonants and by the word’s predictability given the pre-
ceding word, whereas its absence was conditioned by word position in the utterance,
the number of consonants in the sequence that results from the absence of schwa,
13

and whether this sequence adheres to the sonority principle. The authors of these
last two studies concluded that the absence of schwa is not always the extreme result
of schwa shortening, but can also result from a categorical process.
So far, evidence for the categorical absence of segments is restricted to the types of
phenomena discussed above. They represent reduction in highly frequent (function)
words or word combinations and reduction that also occurs in formal speech and
in words uttered in isolation. This raises the question whether reduction processes
that are restricted to informal speech and affect many different word types may also
be categorical. If so, this has consequences for our view of the speech production
process: it would indicate that the mental lexicon contains an immense number of
pronunciation variants or that there are many more categorical (i.e., phonological)
reduction processes than previously assumed, which are specified for the conditions
in which they can be applied.
In this chapter, we investigate this question by studying two reduction processes in
Dutch that affect many words, mainly in informal connected speech. Although both
processes have been well documented, little is known about their underlying nature.
The first process is the reduction of schwa, which has been studied before in se-
veral languages, like English (e.g., Dalby, 1984; Davidson, 2006; Patterson, LoCasto,
& Connine, 2003), French (e.g., Bürki, Ernestus, et al., 2011), and Dutch (e.g., Pluy-
maekers, Ernestus, & Baayen, 2005; Van Bergem, 1994). Schuppler et al. (2011)
reported that in Dutch 44.7% of all schwas are absent. Generally, the studies on
Dutch have shown that schwa tends to be more reduced in faster speech, in words
that occur more frequently, after fricatives and before plosives, and in words in the
middle of utterances.
The second process that we will examine is the reduction of /t/, which has been
studied, among others, in Dutch (e.g., Booij, 1995; Cho & McQueen, 2005; Mitterer
& Ernestus, 2006; Schuppler et al., 2012) and English (e.g., Gahl & Garnsey, 2004;
Gregory, Raymond, Bell, Fosler-Lussier, & Jurafsky, 1999). In careful Dutch, /t/ is
usually produced with a closure and a burst. In informal Dutch, the closure and
burst of /t/ may be weakened, shortened, and even be completely absent (Mitterer
& Ernestus, 2006). For this speech register, /t/ has been reported to be absent in
11.9% of all word tokens and in one-third of the word tokens in which it is in final
position (Schuppler et al., 2011). Overall, previous research has shown that in Dutch
/t/ is more likely to be reduced in more informal speech, in unstressed syllables, in
non-final sentence position, in more predictable word pairs, and if preceded by /s/ or
followed by a bilabial consonant than by vowels or other consonants. In some highly
frequent words, such as niet, /t/ can also be absent in more formal speech registers.
By studying these two segments in the same words and with the same methods, we
can reveal differences that can be directly ascribed to their phonetic characteristics,
to their position in the word, or, more importantly, to the nature (categorical versus
gradient) of the underlying processes. Previous studies have investigated the reduc-
tion of different segments within one word (e.g., Pluymaekers et al., 2005), but only a
14
Mental representation and processing of reduced words in casual speech
few, if any, have addressed the question of whether these segments were reduced as
a consequence of the same processes.
Our study focuses on the reduction of schwa and /t/ in Dutch past participles,
since both segments occur in regular past participles. Most Dutch regular past par-
ticiples consist of a verb base and the circumfix /x@/ + /t/ (e.g., /mak/ maak ‘make’:
/x@+mak+t/ gemaakt ‘made’). Past participles of verbs that start with one of the
prefixes be-, er-, ge-, her-, ont-, or ver- generally do not have an additional prefix ge-
(e.g., /b@tal/ betaal ‘pay’: /b@tal+t/ betaald ‘paid’). Irregular past participles typically
deviate from regular past participles in that they end in /@(n)/ instead of /t/ (e.g.,
/lop/ loop ‘walk’: /x@+lop+@(n)/ gelopen ‘walked’), or their base shows a vowel
change (e.g., /krœyp/ kruip ‘crawl’: /x@+krop+@(n)/ gekropen ‘crawled’).
This chapter presents two corpus studies. Study 1 investigates the reduction of
schwa, focusing on the initial syllables ge-, be-, and ver-, with the full forms /x@/, /b@/,
and /v@r/, respectively. These initial syllables all start with a consonant and given that
the word is a past participle, the following schwa is almost completely predictable, and
therefore probably prone to reduction. Importantly, the three syllables occur in many
word types of various frequencies, which allow us to examine word frequency effects.
In Study 2, we focus on reduction of word-final /t/.
For both schwa and /t/, we examined which variables condition their acoustic pres-
ence versus absence and which variables condition their durations. If a segment’s
absence and duration are conditioned by the same variables, we hypothesize that
they result from the same shortening process, which in extreme cases results in the
absence of a segment. If its absence is conditioned by different variables to its du-
ration, we then hypothesize that its absence results from a categorical process. We
studied variables that are known to play important roles in pronunciation variation,
such as speech register (e.g., Van Bael, Van den Heuvel, & Strik, 2004; Van Son &
Pols, 1999), the position of a word in the utterance (e.g., Bell, Jurafsky, Fosler-Lussier,
Girand, & Gildea, 2003; Cambier-Langeveld, 2000), speech rate (e.g., Dalby, 1984;
Davidson, 2006), the characteristics of the surrounding consonants (e.g., Mitterer &
Ernestus, 2006; Van Bergem, 1994), and word predictability (e.g., Bell, Brenier, Gre-
gory, Girand, & Jurafsky, 2009; Pluymaekers et al., 2005). In order to be able to study
register, we based our studies on conversational speech from the Ernestus Corpus of
Spontaneous Dutch (Ernestus, 2000) and interview and read speech from the Spo-
ken Dutch Corpus (Oostdijk, 2002).
Following Bürki, Fougeron, et al. (2011) and Torreira & Ernestus (2011), we also
examined the distribution of the duration of the segment. If the absence of a segment
only results from extreme gradient shortening, the duration is expected to show a
unimodal distribution. In contrast, if the absence of that segment can result from both
a gradient and a categorical process, this distribution is expected to be bimodal with
one peak at zero ms (since the absence of the segment can result from categorical
processes and extreme gradient shortening) and one peak around the segment’s
average duration.

Chapter 2
Processes underlying acoustic reduction: a corpus study
In summary, the present corpus study extends the research on pronunciation vari-
ation by investigating the nature of the processes underlying two highly frequent phe-
nomena (i.e., reduction of schwa and /t/ in Dutch) that affect many word types, but
that hardly occur in formal speech or words uttered in isolation. By comparing the vari-
ables that affect a segment’s presence and duration, and by inspecting the distribu-
tion of these segments’ durations, we investigate whether the absence of a segment
results only from extreme shortening or can also result from a categorical deletion
process.
Study 1: Schwa reduction
Method
Materials
We extracted past participles from three subcorpora with different speech registers.
The first corpus is the Ernestus Corpus of Spontaneous Dutch (ECSD; Ernestus,
2000), which consists of 15 hours of casual dialogues between ten pairs of speak-
ers. All 20 speakers were native speakers of standard Dutch, born and raised in
the west of the Netherlands, aged between 21 and 55, and they all held academic
degrees. The second and third subcorpora are components of the Spoken Dutch
Corpus (CGN; Oostdijk, 2002): we used those parts of the 43 hours of interviews
with 681 speakers and the 64 hours of lively read passages of the library of the blind
produced by 324 speakers, that were phonetically transcribed (see below) at the mo-
ment of this study.
We extracted all past participles produced without background noise or overlap-
ping speech from other speakers. Because ge- and be- consist of a consonant plus
schwa, we only extracted tokens of ver- where /r/ was absent (which is the most
common pronunciation of ver- and these tokens therefore form the majority of to-
kens). Furthermore, tokens directly preceded or followed by hesitations or with an
extremely short (i.e., shorter than 15 ms) or long (i.e., longer than 478 ms) conso-
nant preceding schwa were discarded. Since it is difficult to determine the pres-
ence and duration of schwa if it is followed by a vowel, we only used words for
our study whose second syllable start with a consonant. All bi-syllabic and most
longer past participles were stressed on the second syllable (e.g., /x@"dAnst/ gedanst
‘danced’, /b@"vEst@xt/ bevestigd ‘confirmed’, /x@"wAnd@lt/ gewandeld ‘walked’). Ta-
ble 2.1 presents an overview of the final data set of schwa in word-initial syllables.
The number of tokens per word type ranged from 1 to 151. Compared to the frequent
words and word combinations discussed in the literature on the processes underlying
reduction, the words in our data set are all of a low frequency. The most frequent
word in our study was geweest ‘been’, which occurs 54 times per 100000 word to-
kens (based on counts from the data used for this study), whereas the highly frequent
bigram c’était ‘it was’ studied by Torreira & Ernestus (2011) occurs 280 times per

Measurements
We determined the presence versus absence of schwa and its duration on the ba-
sis of automatically generated broad phonetic transcriptions. Automatic transcrip-
tions are more consistent than human transcriptions and can be easily generated
for large quantities of speech. For all materials used, we followed the forced align-
ment procedure described by Schuppler et al. (2011). For each word token in the
orthographic transcriptions an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system retrieved
the full phonetic form and possible pronunciation variants from a pronunciation lex-
icon. For instance, for the word gemaakt ‘made’ it retrieved the full form /x@makt/
and the variants /xmakt/, /x@mak/, and /xmak/. The possible pronunciation vari-
ants resulted from the application of 32 reduction rules to the full pronunciations of
the words. These rules were based on earlier observations of reduced variants in
casual Dutch (e.g., Ernestus, 2000), and deleted, among others, schwa in the sylla-
bles ge-, be-, or ver-, and word-final /t/. From all retrieved pronunciation variants,
the ASR system HTK (Hidden Marcov Model Toolkit; Young et al., 2002) selected the
variant that best matched the speech signal, using 37 monophone models. These
32-Gaussian tri-state models (Hämäläinen et al., 2009) had been trained on the read
speech component of the CGN. Because the acoustic models consisted of at least
three emitting states and the frame shift was 5 ms, segments were assigned a mini-
mum duration of 15 ms (even if the actual duration was shorter). On average, schwa
was assigned a duration of 48 ms (range 15 - 225 ms) and /t/ a duration of 85 ms
(range 15 - 355 ms).
In order to validate the automatic transcriptions, two of the authors manually tran-
scribed 148 schwas in the ECSD data set. We chose ECSD for the validation, be-
17

cause its speech style is the hardest to transcribe. The manual transcriptions were
based on the audio and the waveform of the target word and a few surrounding words.
The two transcribers first decided on transcription criteria and thereafter transcribed
schwa and the preceding and following segments independently from each other us-
ing the speech analysis software package Praat (Boersma, 2001). They did so with-
out being aware of the results of the ASR system.
As the schwas that were transcribed belonged to the syllables ge-, be-, or ver-, they
were preceded by /x/, /b/, /p/, /v/, or /f/. The transcribers placed the boundary
between a fricative and schwa at the offset of frication noise. The boundary in a /b@/
sequence was located directly after the burst of the plosive. Schwa could be followed
by different kinds of consonants. If it was a fricative, the boundary was formed by the
onset of frication noise. If it was a plosive, the boundary was located at the onset
of the closure. Finally, if schwa was followed by a sonorant, the transcribers defined
the transition as sudden changes in the audio or qualitative changes in the shape or
complexity of the periodicity of the waveform.
Table 2.2 compares the presence of schwa in the word-initial syllables as anno-
tated by the ASR system and the two transcribers. We found an agreement of 82.4%
and a Cohen’s kappa of 0.64 between the two human transcribers, and agreements of
75.7% and 77.0% and kappas of 0.51 and 0.53 between the ASR system and each of
the human transcribers. A regression model with the dependent variable agreement
on the presence of schwa, the independent variable transcriber pair and the random
variable word type showed no significant effects (A-H1 versus A-H2: β = 0.01, t =
0.30, n.s.; A-H1 versus H1-H2: β = 0.07, t = 1.48, n.s.; A-H2 versus H1-H2: β =
0.05, t = 1.19, n.s.). This indicates that the agreements between the ASR and each
human transcriber do not differ substantially from the agreement between the two hu-
man transcribers. These agreements are also similar to other transcriber agreements
obtained for informal speech. For example, Kipp, Wesenick, & Schiel (1997) reported
agreements between three human-made transcriptions of spontaneous German of
at least 78.8%, and Pitt, Johnson, Hume, Kiesling, & Raymond (2005) presented an

We also compared the durations of those schwas that were transcribed as present
by the human transcribers or the ASR system. For this analysis, three outliers with
durations longer than 210 ms were excluded (as they were in the duration analysis de-
scribed below). Table 2.2 presents the results (including mean duration differences)
without these outliers. A regression model with transcriber as the independent factor
and word type as the random factor indicated that the durations assigned by the dif-
ferent transcribers differed significantly (1-A: β = 0.02, t = 6.23, p < 0.0001; 1-2: β
= 0.01, t = 2.04, p < 0.05; 2-A: β = 0.02, t = 4.22, p < 0.0001). Those of the ASR
system are the longest, which is unsurprising as these are minimally 15 ms. Those
of Transcriber 2 are longer than those of Transcriber 1. Further comparison of the
durations assigned by the ASR system and the human transcribers showed that the
differences were mainly caused by three outliers (5% of the data points). Removal of
these data points resulted in mean differences of 12.8 ms and 3.7 ms between the
ASR system and Transcriber 1 and 2, respectively. These average differences are
similar to those obtained in other studies. For example, Wesenick & Kipp (1996) re-
ported that 96% of the segment boundaries determined by three human transcribers
for 64 read sentences of German differ by less than 20 ms. Similarly, Raymond et
al. (2002) presented an average alignment difference of 16.4 ms between human
transcribers of the Buckeye corpus.
This evaluation shows that our automatically obtained transcriptions are compa-
rable to human-made transcriptions. As it is currently not possible to easily obtain
significantly better transcriptions for a large number of tokens, we accept our auto-
matic transcriptions to be valid. Given the average duration of schwa (48 ms) and
the mean differences in duration assigned by the different transcribers and the ASR
system (3.7 and 12.8 ms), our data will, however, have to be interpreted with care.
The validation described above did not include tokens based on /h/-initial verbal
bases (e.g., gehaast ‘rushed’), because manual inspection showed that the automatic
transcriptions of these tokens were not reliable. We therefore decided not to rely on
the automatic transcriptions, but have the first syllable and /h/ of 210 past participles
transcribed by the same two transcribers. They used the same acoustic criteria as
described above and identified boundaries between schwa and /h/ as transitions in
the waveform and audio. The two transcribers agreed on the presence of schwa for
approximately 73.3% of the tokens (κ: 0.46), and the differences in schwa duration
were only 0.7 ms on average (with a 95% confidence interval from -3.3 to 1.9 ms)
and non-significant. We included only those tokens in the data set for which the
transcribers agreed on the presence of schwa, and we used the average durations
from their transcriptions.

Predictors
We tested the role of several predictors that have previously been shown to condition
segment reduction. A first predictor was speech register, since reduction has been
shown to be more prominent in more informal speech (e.g., Van Bael et al., 2004;
Van Son & Pols, 1999). This factor differentiated between the conversational speech
(CS) of the ECSD, the interviews (IN) of the CGN, and the read speech (RS) of the
CGN. A second variable was speech rate, since words tend to be more reduced in
faster speech (e.g., Dalby, 1984; Davidson, 2006). We defined speech rate as the
number of syllables per second in the continuous uninterrupted stretch of speech that
contained the target word assuming that all words had been produced in their full
forms. This variable ranged from 2.36 to 10.67 syllables per second.
In addition, the segmental context of schwa may affect its pronunciation (Davidson,
2006). We therefore tested the role of the identity of the first syllable. This predictor
contrasted the syllable ge- with the syllables be- and ver-. The syllables be- and
ver- were pooled, since there appeared to be fewer tokens of be- (n = 242) and
ver- (n = 213) than of ge- (n = 1695), and because preliminary results indicated
that be- and ver- show similar behavior. Note that this predictor also distinguishes
between the different preceding consonants (i.e., /x/ versus /b/ and /v/). Since
schwa may be co-articulated with the preceding consonant, which then may result in
a longer preceding consonant and a shortened or absent schwa, another potential
conditioning variable is the duration of the preceding segment (duration preceding
segment). We used the log-transformed duration (see below), which ranged from
4.00 to 8.83. Another predictor indicated whether the places of articulation of the
consonant preceding and the consonant following schwa are identical (identical place;
identical: n = 530, different: n = 1620). If the surrounding consonants share their
place of articulation, schwa tends to be longer due to the physiological difficulty of
gesture repetition (e.g., Walter, 2007).
Several prosodic variables have also been shown to affect speech reduction. We
tested the role of word length, since segments tend to be shorter if they are fol-
lowed by more syllables (Lindblom, 1963; Nooteboom, 1972). This binary factor dis-
tinguished bi-syllabic words (n = 1142) from words with more than two syllables (n =
1008). Another prosodic variable is chunk finality, which indicates whether the word
was the last word of a chunk of speech (final: n = 872; non-final: n = 1278). A chunk
is surrounded by pauses, and may contain a part of a sentence, or one or multiple
complete sentences. Especially in read speech, a chunk corresponds to a prosodic
unit, and words at the end of a chunk may therefore undergo prosodic lengthening
(e.g., Cambier-Langeveld, 2000).
Finally, we added three predictability variables because words that occur more of-
ten or are more likely to occur given their context have been found to be more reduced
(e.g., Bell et al., 2009; Pluymaekers et al., 2005). We tested (1) the log-transformed
word frequency, (2) the conditional probability of the target word (wtarget) given the
20
Mental representation and processing of reduced words in casual speech
preceding word (wpreceding), which was estimated by
log2(
frequency(wpreceding, wtarget)
frequency(wpreceding)
), (2.1)
and (3) the conditional probability of the target word given the following word (wfollowing),
calculated with
log2(
frequency(wtarget, wfollowing)
frequency(wfollowing)
). (2.2)
All frequency measures used for the calculation of these predictors are based on
counts from all CGN components.
Analyses
We investigated the influences of the predictors on the presence of schwa and its
duration by means of mixed effects regression models (Baayen, Davidson, & Bates,
2008). In all models speaker and word type were considered as crossed random
factors. Further, we used contrast coding, where for each qualitative variable, one
level is treated as the standard level to which all other levels are compared. In order to
create a normal distribution for the duration of schwa, we applied a log-transformation
to this duration (ms) and also transformed the duration of the preceding segment. In
the duration analyses, segments differing more than 2.5 times the residual standard
errors from the values predicted by the statistical models were considered outliers,
thus removed, and the models were refitted.
Most studies assume that a predictor influences reduction if it is statistically signifi-
cant in a statistical model. As a consequence, these studies also assume predictors
to be relevant if they hardly improve or even worsen the model’s relative goodness
of fit. We initially applied this procedure, but then decided to abandon it as our cor-
pus study is based on many data points (i.e., 2150) and we found many significant
effects, including high-order interactions. Most of these effects had very small effect
sizes and several were not interpretable. We therefore adopted a more conservative
approach based on the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC; Akaike, 1973). The AIC
measure is defined as −2 logL + 2p, where L is the maximum of the likelihood for
the model, and p is the number of parameters in the model. We added predictors
one by one to a regression model. A predictor or interaction was only retained if it
showed a significant effect and if the model with this predictor or interaction had a
lower absolute AIC value than the same model without this predictor or interaction.
Only predictors that passed these criteria are presented in the results section.
Before we added a predictor to a model, we checked for possible correlations with
the predictors already present in that model. When predictor A correlated with predic-
tor B, we first orthogonalized them. That is, we replaced predictor A by the residuals
of a linear regression model that predicted this predictor A as a function of predictor
B, or vice versa.

Following Bürki, Fougeron, et al. (2011) and Torreira & Ernestus (2011), we also
examined the distribution of the duration of schwa. We restricted the analysis to
those tokens of schwa that are not highly likely to be absent due to co-articulation
with the surrounding segments. If we find a peak at zero ms, this peak can therefore
be interpreted as resulting from categorical reduction processes.
Results
The statistical results are presented in Table 2.3. The analysis of the presence of
schwa was based on 2150 tokens of past participles, 68.4% of which were pro-
duced with schwa. The statistical model showed significant effects of speech register
and syllable, indicating that schwa was more often absent in conversational speech
(52.0%) than in interviews (35.3%), and least often in read speech (12.1%), and that it
was more often absent in the syllable ge- (35.5%) compared to be- and ver- (17.4%).
In addition, there were main effects of word length and speech rate, which were mod-

ulated by an interaction of these two variables. Schwa was more likely to be absent in
bi-syllabic past participles, especially at higher speech rates (see Figure 2.1). Finally,
duration preceding segment was significant, showing that schwa was more likely to
be absent if preceded by a longer segment. The model estimated the standard devi-
ation of the random variable word type at 0.82 and of speaker at 0.42.
The analysis of the duration of schwa was based on the 1470 schwas that were
present. We found significant effects of speech rate and identical place: schwa was
shorter at higher speech rates and if the preceding and following consonant had dif-
ferent places of articulation (mean duration for different place: 44 ms; for identical
place: 54 ms). Also, the effects of syllable and speech register were significant, and
they were modulated by their interaction: in read speech, schwa tended to be shorter
in ge- (mean: 43 ms) than in be- and ver- (mean: 52 ms). Finally, the model con-
tained random effects involving word type: the standard deviation (in log ms) for the
intercept was 0.22, the estimated standard deviations for interviews was 0.36, and for
conversational speech 0.31, with estimated correlations of -0.20 (IN) and -0.11 (CS).
The residual standard deviation was 0.52.

Figure 2.2 shows the kernel density plot for the duration of schwa. This plot is an
estimation of the duration density and can be viewed as a smoothed version of a his-
togram. The plot is based on all data points that are not outliers (i.e., schwas shorter
than 210 ms) and for which we expect no strong co-articulation (i.e., schwas not fol-
lowed by a voiceless obstruent or a voiced fricative; Ernestus, 2000). Importantly,
this plot clearly shows two peaks. This is as expected assuming that the absence of
schwa can result from a categorical process and from a gradient shortening process.
Study 2: /t/ reduction
Method
Materials
From the data set used in Study 1, we selected all past participles that ended in
/t/. We excluded those that were directly followed by a plosive, as /t/ is then often
unreleased (55.3% according to Schuppler et al., 2011), which makes it difficult to
determine the boundary between /t/ and the following plosive. The data set for Study
2 consisted of 1166 word tokens, representing 355 word types (404 word tokens
representing 133 types from CS, 292 tokens representing 132 types from IN, and 470
tokens representing 227 types from RS).

Mental representation and processing of reduced words in casual speech
Measurements, predictors, and analyses
To determine the presence versus absence of /t/ and its duration, we used the
method described in Study 1. In connected speech, /t/ may have no oral closure
and thus exist of weak frication only. Since the /t/ phone model of the ASR system
was trained on both full and reduced /t/s; it is also able to recognize reduced /t/s
(see, for instance, Figure 2.3).
The reduction of /t/ was analyzed using the same method as in Study 1, and the
predictors used in these analyses were also the same with a few exceptions: we did
not include the variables syllable and identical place, as these are specific for the ini-
tial syllable. Instead, we added a factor that identified the type of segment preceding
/t/. Since /t/ is often reduced after obstruents, especially /s/ (e.g., Ernestus, 2000),
this factor distinguished between /s/ (n = 188), /x,f/ (n = 191), /p,k/ (n = 191), and
other segments (n = 787). Preliminary analyses showed that these other segments
(vowels and sonorants) had the same effect.

Results
Table 2.4 presents the results of Study 2. The analysis of the presence of word-
final /t/ was based on 1166 past participles, of which 77.9% were produced with
/t/. The statistical model yielded significant main effects of speech rate, speech
register, and type of preceding segment : word-final /t/ was more likely to be absent
at higher speech rates and in more informal speech (CS: 29.0%; IN: 29.1%; RS:
11.9%). In addition, it was most often absent if preceded by a fricative (/s/: 44.1%;
/x,f/: 40.3%), than if preceded by a plosive (25.1%), and least often in other cases
(8.4%). The standard deviation of the random effect word type was estimated at 0.49.

Figure 2.4: The distribution of the duration of /t/.
The statistical model for the durations of the 908 /t/s that were present showed sig-
nificant effects of speech rate and type of preceding segment : word-final /t/ tended
to be shorter at higher speech rates, and if the preceding segment was a fricative,
especially /s/ (mean durations: /s/ 69 ms; /x,f/ 78 ms; /p,k/ 85 ms; other 90 ms).
Furthermore, chunk finality and speech register showed significant main effects and
an interaction: past participles tended to end in longer /t/s in chunk final than in
chunk initial or medial position, especially in less informal speech (mean durations:
CS final: 88 ms, CS non-final: 74 ms, IN final: 80 ms, IN non-final: 58 ms, RS final:
114 ms, RS non-final: 70 ms). The estimated standard deviation of speaker was 0.17
log ms, and the residual standard deviation was 0.55 log ms.
Figure 2.4 shows the kernel density plot of the distribution of /t/ duration. It is
based on those tokens in which strong co-articulation is not very likely (i.e., if /t/ is
not preceded or followed by a bilabial or alveolar segment nor by a fricative). This plot
shows two peaks, but the peak at zero is small and not very distinctive, suggesting
that if a categorical process plays a role in /t/ duration, it is a very minor one.
General discussion
This chapter investigated whether highly frequent reduction processes that affect
many word types, but only in informal speech, can be categorical in nature. In par-
ticular, we investigated the presence versus absence and duration of schwa and /t/
in Dutch past participles. If a segment’s absence and duration are conditioned by
the same variables, they probably result from the same gradient shortening process.
In contrast, if the absence of a segment is conditioned by different variables than its
shortening, we hypothesize that the absence may result from categorical processes,

for instance, a phonological rule or the selection of a reduced pronunciation variant
from the mental lexicon.
We extracted past participles from the Ernestus Corpus of Spontaneous Dutch
(Ernestus, 2000) and the Spoken Dutch Corpus (Oostdijk, 2002). Study 1 analyzed
2150 schwas in the word-initial syllables ge-, be-, and ver-, and Study 2 focused
on the subset of 1166 past participles ending in /t/. We determined a segment’s
presence and duration on the basis of automatically generated broad phonetic tran-
scriptions, and found that schwa and /t/ were present in 68.4% and 77.9% of the
tokens, respectively. An evaluation of the automatic transcriptions revealed that they
were comparable to human-made transcriptions.
The reduction of schwa and /t/ have been hypothesized to occur more often in
more informal speech (e.g., Van Bael et al., 2004; Van Son & Pols, 1999). Our data
confirm this hypothesis. In our conversational speech, we found that schwa and /t/
were absent in 44.9% and 29.0% of the tokens, respectively, whereas in the read
speech, they were absent in only 12.1% and 11.9% of the tokens, although the read
speech that we investigated consists of lively read passages from the library of the
blind, and is not as formal as, for instance, speeches or lectures.
Our data present three types of evidence that the absence of /t/ is mostly due to
extreme gradient shortening. The first evidence comes from Figure 2.4, which shows
the distribution of the duration of /t/ for those tokens that are surrounded by segments
with which it is not easily co-articulated. This distribution shows only one clear peak,
which suggests the absence of /t/ results from gradient shortening. The small peak
at zero ms, however, leaves open the possibility that /t/ may occasionally also be
absent due to categorical processes. Possibly, /t/ may be categorically absent in a
small number of (high frequency) words.
The second type of evidence comes from the types of variables that affect /t/
reduction (see Table 2.5), since the effects of all these variables may result from co-
articulation. Like all co-articulation processes, /t/ was more often reduced in more
informal speech and at higher speech rates. Moreover, it was also more reduced
if preceded by a voiceless obstruent, particularly /s/. If articulatory gestures are
decreased in magnitude (Browman & Goldstein, 1990), a /t/ may be realized with
Table 2.5: Significant predictors for the presence and duration of /t/.

an incomplete closure and consequently be difficult to distinguish from a preceding
obstruent. This is especially the case if this preceding obstruent is /s/, which shares
its place of articulation with /t/. Finally, we found that /t/s were longer in chunk final
position, especially in less informal speech. The chunks in read speech more often
coincided with the ends of prosodic units (e.g., intonational phrases) than the chunks
in conversational speech. As a consequence, the end of a chunk in read speech is
more likely to show final lengthening (see Cambier-Langeveld, 2000).
Thirdly, the duration and presence of /t/ are influenced by exactly the same vari-
ables. The only exception is the position of the word in the chunk, which affected
only /t/, duration. We probably did not find an effect of this variable on the presence
of /t/ because analyses of binomial factors usually have less statistical power than
analyses of continuous measures. Also this similarity in variables suggests that the
absence of /t/ mainly results from gradient shortening.
The results for schwa reduction are similar to those of /t/ reduction in that most
effects on the presence and duration of schwa (see Table 2.6) can be interpreted as
resulting from co-articulation. First, like other co-articulation processes, schwa reduc-
tion was more frequent in more informal speech and at higher speech rates. Second,
schwa was more often absent after longer consonants, which strongly suggests that
its absence often resulted from the articulatory overlap of the preceding consonant
and schwa (Browman & Goldstein, 1990). Third, schwa tended to be longer if the
places of articulation of the preceding and following consonants were identical. This
finding is in line with findings by Walter (2007), who argues that the production of two
subsequent consonants with the same place of articulation requires more effort than
the production of a non-repetition sequence, which leads to longer vowels between
two consonants with the same place of articulation.
Fourth, we found a clear effect of the different word-initial syllables. In general,
schwa tended to be more often present in be- and ver- than in ge-. We found the
same effect for the duration of schwa, but only in read speech. The difference be-

tween the syllables probably results from their morphological functions. The syllables
be- and ver- are derivational prefixes and therefore contain crucial semantic informa-
tion about the identity of the word, as illustrated by the minimal word pair /b@talt/
betaald ‘paid’ versus /v@rtalt/ vertaald ‘translated’. In contrast, the syllable ge- is
an inflectional prefix in 375 of the 387 examined word types, indicating that the word
is a past participle (as in /x@fitst/ gefietst ‘cycled’, whose stem does not occur with
other prefixes), which is usually expected given the context. As a consequence, the
syllables be- and ver- tend to be less redundant than ge-, and this may result in dif-
ferences in reduction (see Chapter 5 of this dissertation for an overview of the role
of predictability in reduction). Probably, the effect on duration is only demonstrated
in read speech since, in this register, speakers are more aware of the listener and
their speech tends to be more listener-driven than in less formal registers (Lindblom,
1990).
Finally, we found an interaction of word length with speech rate, with schwa being
more often absent in bi-syllabic than in longer words, especially at higher speech
rates. The direction of this effect is unexpected given previous studies which have
shown that vowels tend to be shorter if they are followed by more syllables in the
word (Lindblom, 1963; Nooteboom, 1972). We therefore conducted further analyses
and found that bi-syllabic and longer words did not only differ in terms of the number
of syllables, but that they also differed in several measures of contextual predictability:
for instance, the bi-syllabic words are significantly more frequent (mean log frequency:
9.06) than the longer words (mean log frequency: 7.68; t = 10.94, p < 0.0001). Since
more predictable words are more likely to be reduced, especially at higher speech
rates (e.g., Pluymaekers et al., 2005), the effect of word length may actually be an
effect of contextual predictability.
The variables affecting schwa reduction thus indicate that the absence of schwa
also results from gradient shortening. In addition, the absence of schwa may result
from categorical processes, as is indicated by two other types of results. First, the
density plot of the duration of schwa (Figure 2.2) clearly shows two modes: one mode
representing the absent schwas and the other mode containing the present schwas.
Second, if the absence of a segment only results from gradient shortening, we expect
that its presence and duration would be affected by the same variables, as we found
for /t/ above, and as has been found in several other studies (e.g., Torreira & Ernes-
tus, 2010b; Chapter 3 of this dissertation). In contrast to this expectation, we found
that the presence of schwa, but not its duration, is affected by word length, an inter-
action of word length with speech rate, and the duration of the preceding consonant,
whereas its duration, but not its presence, is affected by an interaction of the identity
of the first syllable with speech register and by whether the surrounding consonants
share their place of articulation (see Table 2.6). Moreover, we found that the presence
of schwa was influenced by more variables than its duration. Given that analyses of
continuous variables generally have greater statistical power than analyses of bino-
mial factors, this difference is unexpected if the presence and duration of schwa result
30
Mental representation and processing of reduced words in casual speech
from the same articulatory process.
There is, however, one possible explanation for the greater number of predictors
for the absence of schwa versus its duration. The duration data set contained 31.6%
fewer data points than the data set on the presence of schwa, and the duration ana-
lysis may therefore have had less statistical power. However, for /t/ the duration data
set also contained 22.1% fewer data points than the data set on its presence, and
for /t/ we did not find that its duration was conditioned by fewer variables than its
presence. It seems therefore unlikely that the difference in number of data points
can explain the difference in the number of significant effects in the analyses of the
presence and duration of schwa.
Furthermore, we examined whether a difference in the sizes of the data sets ex-
plains why the presence of schwa was affected by more variables than its duration,
whereas this is not the case for /t/. We restricted the schwa data set to those 1162
tokens that also occur in the /t/ data set. Due to the smaller sample size, this data
set showed fewer effects on the presence of schwa than the original data set (see
the Appendix). Importantly, the variables that condition the presence and duration
of schwa are still different. For /t/, we expanded the data set in order to obtain a
data set that was as large as the original schwa data set. Since the corpus did not
contain past participles that met all restrictions and that were not yet part of the data
set, we expanded the data set with other word types (e.g., adjectives and other verb
forms). This new data set consisted of 1993 tokens in total. The presence and dura-
tion of these new tokens of /t/ were determined with the same procedures described
in Study 2. This analysis yielded three additional effects influencing both the pres-
ence and duration of /t/ (see the Appendix). Overall, these re-analyses show the
same patterns as the original analyses. Apparently, statistical power cannot explain
the differences in conditioning variables.
On the basis of these findings, we conclude that the absence of schwa in Dutch
can result both from gradient and categorical reduction processes. In future research,
the evidence for categorical reduction may be extended with more detailed acoustic
analyses of our data, like the analyses reported on French c’était ‘it was’ by Torreira
& Ernestus (2011).
Thus far, categorical reduction processes have only been identified for highly fre-
quent words or word combinations (e.g., /e/-deletion in French c’était, Torreira &
Ernestus, 2011) and for phenomena that do not only occur in informal conversations,
but also in formal speech or in words uttered in isolation (e.g., word-internal schwa
deletion in French, Bürki, Ernestus, et al., 2011). Gradient reduction has been ob-
served for reduction that affects many words, but only if uttered in connected informal
speech (e.g., vowel devoicing in French, Torreira & Ernestus, 2010b). In line with
this pattern, we found that reduction of word-final /t/ in Dutch, which affects many
words in connected informal speech, is mainly gradient in nature. In contrast, the
results for schwa point to a more complex picture. The comparison of the variables
conditioning the absence and duration of schwa as well as the distribution of schwa
31
Chapter 2
Processes underlying acoustic reduction: a corpus study
duration suggest that extreme vowel shortening is not the only process that can result
in its absence. Hence, categorical reduction is not restricted to highly frequent word
combinations or phenomena that also occur in formal speech registers.
The categorical process that results in the absence of schwa may consist of ei-
ther the application of phonological rules or the selection of a reduced pronunciation
variant from the mental lexicon during speech production. If the absence of schwa
results from phonological rules, we expect these rules to apply to all words equally
often (word-specific rules would be similar to the storage of the reduced pronuncia-
tion variants together with their frequencies). Our analyses showed that the random
factor word type has a standard deviation of 0.81, which indicates that words differ
substantially in their probability that schwa is absent (approximately 20%). This sug-
gests that words are not reduced equally often. The categorical absence of schwa is
therefore not likely to result from phonological rules, but from variant selection. This
implies that for many words, the mental lexicon contains at least two pronunciation
variants.
Our findings raise the question why the absence of /t/ results from a gradient pro-
cess, whereas the absence of schwa can result from both a gradient and a categorical
process. One possible explanation is that the schwa and /t/ in past participles dif-
fer in their perceptual prominence. Whereas schwa is part of the initial syllable, the
/t/ is in word-final position. In addition, schwa is part of a prefix that contributes to
the meaning of the past participle or signals that the word is a past participle, and
therefore carries information. The /t/, in contrast, only indicates the past participle
function, which in most cases is also signaled by the prefix (if it is ge-) or by the syn-
tactic structure of the sentence. Finally, schwa is probably more prominent because
of its acoustic characteristics: a reduced schwa is most likely to be clearly audible,
whereas a /t/ with a weakened burst may be difficult to perceive. As a consequence
of this difference in perceptual prominence, language users may more easily detect
the absence of schwa in the prefix of past participles, and build lexical representations
of pronunciation variants without schwa. They may less often notice the absence of
word-final /t/ and may interpret its absence as resulting from its low prominence.
Accordingly, they may be less inclined to create lexical representations for past par-
ticiples without /t/.
Unexpectedly, our data showed no effects of the word’s (contextual) predictability
on schwa and /t/ reduction. We believe that this is due to our conservative analysis
method: we only retained those variables in our statistical models that were significant
and improved the model’s AIC value. If we do not apply this AIC criterium, effects of a
word’s frequency of occurrence and its predictability given the following word emerge.
Unfortunately, it is currently not possible to draw general conclusions about the role
of predictability in reduction. On the one hand, predictability effects reported in earlier
studies may disappear if our conservative analysis method is applied to these studies.
On the other hand, since past participles tend to be more predictable than other types
of content words, predictability may play no substantial role in the production of these

particular verb forms.
An advantage of using corpus data over experimental data is that the examined
speech is more natural. Our results suggest that corpus data can indeed be used
to infer insights on the processes that drive pronunciation variation. More reliable
phonetic transcriptions will even further increase the usefulness of corpus data. The
findings based on corpus data should nevertheless be confirmed by data obtained
from controlled experiments. It is currently not clear which experimental task would
allow us to investigate the production of casual speech. Chapter 3 of this disser-
tation demonstrated, for instance, that one experimental paradigm that may seem
promising, the shadowing task, elicits fast speech that cannot be compared to casual
speech.
In summary, our results show that the absence of word-final /t/ results from ex-
treme shortening. The absence of schwa, in contrast, can result from gradient vowel
shortening as well as from a categorical process. We therefore conclude that re-
duction phenomena that mostly occur in informal conversations and that affect many
different words can also result from categorical processes. This categorical process
is probably the selection of a variant without schwa from the mental lexicon, which
implies that for many words, the mental lexicon contains at least two pronunciation
variants.
Appendix
To examine whether the difference in power explains why the presence of schwa was
affected by more variables than its duration, we re-analyzed schwa and /t/ with better
matched data sets. The statistical models for schwa showed the same significant
effects as Study 1, but the main effects of syllable and word length and the interaction
between word length and speech rate on the presence of schwa were absent.
For /t/, the statistical models showed the same effects as in Study 2 plus some ad-
ditional effects (see Table 2.7 for these additional effects): word-final /t/ tended to be
more often absent and shorter in word types other than past participles, and in chunk
non-final position, particularly in words other than past participles. Furthermore, /t/
was more likely to be reduced in chunk non-final position if not preceded by fricatives.

Abstract
This chapter investigated whether a shadowing task can provide insights in the na-
ture of reduction processes that are typical of casual speech. We focused on the
shortening and presence versus absence of schwa and /t/ in Dutch past partici-
ples. Results showed that the absence of these segments was affected by the same
variables as their shortening, suggesting that absence mostly resulted from extreme
gradient shortening. This contrasts with results based on recordings of spontaneous
conversations. We hypothesize that this difference is due to non-casual fast speech
elicited by a shadowing task.

Chapter 3
Processes underlying acoustic reduction: a production experiment
Introduction
One main characteristic of casual speech is that many words are not produced in
their full forms, but in reduced pronunciation variants. For example, the English word
hilarious may be produced as /hlErEs/ instead of /hIlEri2s/ (Johnson, 2004). This
production study investigates the processes underlying two of these reduction phe-
nomena in Dutch and compares the results to those of a corpus study. This chapter
contributes to our knowledge of speech reduction and shows the advantages and
disadvantages of two very different research methods for the study of casual speech
phenomena.
Processes underlying speech reduction may be gradient. The altered pronunciation
or even absence of a segment then originates from gradient overlap and decrease in
magnitude of articulatory gestures (Browman & Goldstein, 1992). For instance, /t/
in must be may be partly or even completely hidden by the closure of the following
bilabial stop, which results in /m2sbi/.
In addition, the absence of segments may result from categorical deletion pro-
cesses, which may be phonological rules or the selection of a reduced pronunciation
variant from the variants stored in the mental lexicon. So far, two types of reduction
phenomena have been found to be categorical: processes that affect only highly fre-
quent words or word combinations (e.g., /e/-deletion in French c’était /setE/ ‘it was’;
Torreira & Ernestus, 2011), and phenomena that not only occur in casual, connected
speech, but also in words produced in isolation or formal speech (e.g., word-internal
schwa deletion in French; Bürki et al., 2010).
So far, only one study has investigated the nature of reduction phenomena that
affect many different words and are restricted to connected informal speech (Chap-
ter 2 of this dissertation). It examined schwa and /t/ reduction in past participles in
two speech corpora of Dutch. The results showed that the presence and duration of
/t/ are affected by roughly the same phonetic variables, suggesting that absence of
/t/ results from the same gradient process as its shortening. Also the presence and
duration of schwa were mainly influenced by phonetic variables, but the presence of
schwa was affected by more and different variables than its duration. The authors
therefore argued that schwa reduction can result from gradient as well as categorical
processes.
A disadvantage of corpus studies is that they are often restricted to highly frequent
word types, and that these are represented by a widely varying number of tokens.
Also, the segmental context of units under study cannot be well-controlled for. These
disadvantages do not apply to controlled production experiments, but it is currently
unclear which experimental task can elicit casual speech.
We conducted a shadowing experiment, in which, like in Chapter 2, we focused on
schwa and /t/ reduction in Dutch past participles. These words usually consist of
/x@/, the verbal base, and /t/ (e.g., gedanst /x@+dAns+t/ ‘danced’). We examined
36
Mental representation and processing of reduced words in casual speech
whether this controlled experiment produces results similar to those of the corpus
study mentioned above.
Method
Participants
We tested 35 Dutch native speakers aged between 18 and 27 (mean 20 years).
Materials
Our experiment consisted of 180 target past participles starting with ge- (140 end in
/t/) and 100 filler past participles starting with ver- or be- (88 end in /t/). These past
participles consisted of two or three syllables and the schwa in the initial syllable was
followed by a consonant. They spanned the entire range of frequency of occurrence,
which was based on the Spoken Dutch Corpus (Oostdijk, 2002).
Each past participle was embedded in the middle of a sentence (which on average
consisted of 10 words). Sentence accent was never on the past participle. Also, past
participles were never preceded by a fricative, and those ending in /t/ were never
followed by /t/ or /d/. Whereas we created one sentence for each filler, we created
two sentences for each target: in one sentence the past participle was followed by
a vowel, and in the other by a consonant. For example, the sentences for the tar-
get getankt /x@tEnkt/ ‘refueled’ were (1) Ze had per ongeluk diesel getankt in plaats
van benzine ‘She accidentally refueled diesel instead of gas’, and (2) Hij heeft voor-
namelijk getankt waar de brandstof goedkoop is ‘He mainly refueled where fuel was
cheap’. All sentences were recorded by a native Dutch female speaker in a casual
(average sentence duration: 2019 ms) and careful way (average sentence duration:
2208 ms). On the basis of automatically generated transcriptions (using the same
procedure as described below), we observed that schwa was absent in 125 of the
180 casually produced sentences, while it was never absent in the carefully produced
sentences. The average durations of the present schwas were 28.1 ms (sd: 9.7 ms)
in the casual and 49.2 ms (sd: 12.9 ms) in the careful condition. Participants heard
every past participle only once, that is, only in the casual or in the careful condition,
and followed either by a consonant or a vowel.
The experiment started with a practice block of 10 filler trials followed by four ex-
perimental blocks, each consisting of 45 target and 25 filler sentences. The first block
after the practice trials started with seven fillers, while the other blocks started with
three fillers. Within one block, we presented either casual or careful sentences. If
block one and two contained casual sentences, blocks three and four consisted of
careful sentences, and vice versa.
We created three pseudo-randomizations of all stimuli, in which no more than three
target sentences occurred in succession. On the basis of each randomization, we
37
Chapter 3
Processes underlying acoustic reduction: a production experiment
created four lists. In each list, half of the target past participles were followed by a
vowel, and the other half by a consonant. Moreover, half of the stimuli in a list had
been produced in a casual way, and the other half in a careful way. Together all four
lists contained all sentences in both speech styles.
Procedure
Each participant was tested individually in a sound-attenuated booth. We presented
sentences via headphones, and asked participants to repeat these sentences as
quickly and accurately as possible, and to start repeating as soon as possible. We
recorded responses on an R-09 Edirol recorder. Each trial started with a fixation point
shown for 500 ms on a computer screen, and after an interval of 100 ms the stimulus
was presented. The next trial started 1500 ms after the end of this stimulus. Each
session lasted approximately 30 minutes.
Data processing
For all target sentences produced, we created automatic broad phonetic transcrip-
tions by means of forced alignment as described in Chapter 2 of this dissertation. The
automatic system selected the variant for each word that best matched the speech
signal from a lexicon that contained, among others, pronunciation variants in which
schwa and /t/ were present or absent. Since the acoustic models consisted of three
emitting states and the frame shift was 5 ms, the system assigned to each segment
a duration of at least 15 ms. If a segment was in reality shorter than 15 ms, its
boundaries were placed within the neighboring segments (which were consequently
assigned a shorter duration than they really had). We validated the automatic tran-
scriptions by manually transcribing 100 target schwas, and found that the agreement
on the presence of schwa between two transcribers (90%) was very similar to those
between each transcriber and the forced alignment (85% and 87%). The average
differences in duration were smaller than 13 ms, which is usually considered as ac-
ceptable for this type of speech (Wesenick & Kipp, 1996). As expected, given the
automatic method used, the durations assigned by the automatic system were gene-
rally greater than the durations assigned by the human transcribers.
We excluded 35% of the 6300 trials in two steps. First, 1866 trials were excluded
on the basis of the transcriptions. We excluded transcriptions that indicated a si-
lence directly before or after the target word, since in these trials the target words
are not embedded in stretches of connected speech. In addition, we excluded tran-
scriptions that were likely to be incorrect. We identified these incorrect transcriptions
by means of a set of criteria, which we determined by checking 200 automatically
generated transcriptions. Transcriptions were excluded that contained three or more
segments of 15 ms in the preceding, target, or following word, which typically indi-
cates that the sentence was produced incompletely or with a wrong word order, or
38
Mental representation and processing of reduced words in casual speech
that the forced alignment system had selected a non-suitable pronunciation variant.
Further, we also excluded trials if the longest phoneme was the schwa or shorter than
50 ms, which are highly likely to be transcription errors. Finally, we excluded those
targets in which the longest phoneme was suspiciously long, as this often indicates
that multiple phonemes are transcribed as one long phoneme. We set the boundary
for suspiciously long plosives at 175 ms, for vowels and fricatives at 165 ms, and for
other consonants at 155 ms. In the second step, we listened to all remaining trials,
and excluded from further analyses those 339 trials in which the speaker had not pro-
duced the target word or the directly preceding or following word fluently. The fact that
we discarded 2205 out of 6300 trials shows that the task was difficult. Interestingly,
the number of disregarded trials varied among participants from 23 to 104 trials.
Predictors
We tested the influence of several predictors on the presence and duration of schwa
and /t/. Three of these predictors were defined on the basis of the experimental
design. The first predictor is the register (careful or casual) in which the stimulus was
presented. The second predictor tested whether there were differences between the
blocks of the experiment. The third predictor is the duration of the sentence presented
to the participant.
Further, we added other predictors to our statistical models that the literature has
shown to be relevant. One of these is speech rate, since segments tend to be more
reduced in faster speech (e.g., Dalby, 1984). We defined speech rate as the number
of syllables per second in the whole sentence produced by the participant. In addition,
we tested a factor word length, which indicates whether the past participle consisted
of two or three syllables, as segments are often shorter if they are followed by more
syllables (Nooteboom, 1972).
We also examined three measures of word predictability, since words tend to be
more reduced if they are more predictable (e.g., Bell et al., 2009). One measure was
the log-transformed word’s frequency of occurrence. The second and third measures
were the conditional probabilities (CP) of the target word (wtarget) given the preceding
word (wpreceding) or the following word (wfollowing), which were calculated with formu-
lae 3.1 and 3.2, respectively. The frequencies used for these predictability measures
were based on all components of the Spoken Dutch Corpus (Oostdijk, 2002).

Frequency(wpreceding, wtarget) + 1
Frequency(wpreceding) + 1
) (3.1)
log2(
Frequency(wtarget, wfollowing) + 1
(wfollowing) + 1
) (3.2)
Finally, the surrounding segments may affect reduction (e.g., Dalby, 1984). For
schwa, we therefore tested the log-transformed durations of the preceding and fol-
lowing consonants, the place and manner of articulation of the following consonant,
39
Chapter 3
Processes underlying acoustic reduction: a production experiment
as well as its voicing, and whether it was velar. For /t/, we examined the place and
manner of articulation of the preceding segment, the log-transformed durations of the
preceding and following segments, and whether the following segment was a vowel
or a consonant (henceforth type).
Analyses
We used mixed effects regression models with contrast coding (i.e., for factors, one
level is placed on the intercept, and all other levels are compared to this default level).
In order to account for differences between individual stimuli and participants, the
models contained target word and participant as crossed random effects. Each pre-
dictor was added individually to a model, and only remained in that model if it was
significant and improved the AIC value. Duration analyses were based on present
segments only.
Results and discussion for schwa
Table 3.1 presents the two final statistical models for the presence and duration of
schwa. As expected, schwa was more often absent and shorter if the stimulus was
produced in a casual (29.8%; 42 ms) compared to a careful way (22.9%; 45 ms).
However, this difference in duration was much smaller than the difference between
the stimuli in the two conditions.
Replicating earlier findings (Bell et al., 2009), schwa was more often absent and
shorter in past participles with higher frequencies of occurrence. Highly frequent
words are produced more often, and their production has therefore become more
automatized and efficient. This typically results in more overlapping gestures.
Also, the consonants surrounding schwa affected its reduction. The main effect of
the manner of articulation of the following consonant showed that schwa was signifi-
cantly longer if this consonant was a plosive (47 ms), and shorter if it was a fricative
(38 ms; other segments: 44 ms). We hypothesize that schwa can more easily be
co-articulated with a following fricative than a following plosive, since fricatives are
continuants.
In addition, we found an effects of the duration of the following consonant. Since
the duration of the following consonant correlated with its manner of articulation, we
orthogonalized these variables: we replaced this duration by the residuals of a model
that predicted duration as a function of manner of articulation. Schwa tended to
be shorter if the preceding and following consonants were longer. Schwa was also
more likely to be absent if the preceding consonant was longer, especially in block
1 and 3. Moreover, this vowel was more often absent if the following consonant
was longer, especially if this consonant was voiced. The effect of the duration of
the surrounding consonants can also be explained by co-articulation: schwa appears
shortened or completely hidden by the preceding or following consonants, which are

then assigned longer durations. Schwa may often be absent especially before long
consonants that are voiced, since it is more difficult to observe (for both humans and
automatic speech recognizers) a short, co-articulated, voiced vowel next to a voiced
rather than a voiceless consonant.
Finally, speech rate correlated with stimulus register, which we had therefore or-
thogonalized. Schwa was more likely to be shorter at higher speech rates, but only
41
Chapter 3
Processes underlying acoustic reduction: a production experiment
in bi-syllabic past participles. A possible explanation is that vowels tend to be longer
in the initial syllables of bi-syllabic than tri-syllabic words (Nooteboom, 1972). Conse-
quently, schwa in bi-syllabic words can show more variation in its duration (as short-
ening is less likely to result in deletion), and may therefore be more easily affected by
gradient reduction processes like speech rate.
Results and discussion for /t/
The final statistical models for the presence and duration of /t/ are presented in
Table 3.2. Since the duration and type (vowel versus consonant) of the following seg-
ment were correlated, we had orthogonalized them. First, as expected, the models
show that /t/ was shorter at higher speech rates. In addition, /t/ was more likely to
be absent and shortened if it was followed by a consonant (28.3%; 58 ms) than a
vowel (10.5%; 66 ms). The articulatory gestures of /t/ are more similar to those of
other consonants than to those of vowels, since vowels require a relatively open vo-
cal tract whereas consonants typically involve a (almost) closed one. Therefore, /t/s
may more easily overlap with and be hidden by other consonants. If so, they may
be difficult to distinguish from these overlapping consonants, and appear acoustically
shortened or even absent.
Word-final /t/ was also more likely to be absent and shorter if the following segment
was longer, but only if this was a consonant. An explanation may be that if /t/ overlaps
with a following consonant, (part of) its duration may be attributed to this following
consonant. For the presence of /t/, the effects of the following consonant were also
greater if the word was more predictable given the following word. Word combinations
that are often used together are more automatized, can thus be produced more easily,
and are consequently more likely to show effects of co-articulation.
Further, we investigated the roles of the duration of the preceding segment and
its manner of articulation. Since these two predictors were correlated, they were
orthogonalized (following the method for orthogonalization described above). Word-
final /t/ tended to be shorter if the preceding segment was longer, especially if this
segment was a fricative or nasal. If the gestures of /t/ overlap with a preceding
fricative or nasal, its closure may be incomplete, and /t/ may therefore be hard to
distinguish from this fricative or nasal, which then appears longer.
In addition, the interaction of the durations of the preceding and following segments
showed that /t/ was more likely to be absent and shorter if either the preceding or
following segment is longer, especially if the other immediately neighboring segment
is shorter. This suggests that gestural overlap of /t/ with an adjacent segment is
larger if it overlaps less with the other adjacent segment.
Finally, /t/ tended to be shorter and more often absent in words that are more
predicable given the following word. These predictability effects are likely the result
of more sloppy pronunciations of more often repeated and thus more automatized
words or word sequences.

Processes underlying acoustic reduction: a production experiment
General discussion
We demonstrated that the shortening and absence of schwa and /t/ show patterns
that can easily be interpreted as resulting from co-articulation. Furthermore, we found
that their presence and duration were conditioned by similar variables, suggesting
that the absence of these segments is the extreme result of their shortening, and
thus of a gradient underlying process. Note that we did find slightly more effects for
the duration measures, as expected, since analyses of a continuous variable have
generally more statistical power than analyses of a factor.
We expected participants to repeat the pronunciation variants that were presented,
and thus that many more schwas would be absent in the casual than in the careful
condition. However, these percentages were relatively low in both conditions (29.8%
and 22.9%, respectively). Our results thus suggest that participants did not aim at
repeating the variant they heard, but at producing the word’s full form. This would
explain why we did not find evidence for categorical absence of schwa, as reported
in the corpus study of Chapter 2 of this dissertation. Our shadowing task did elicit re-
duction phenomena resulting from co-articulation. Apparently, this task evokes non-
casual fast speech. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that several words which
are often drastically reduced in casual speech (e.g., eigenlijk /EIx@l@k/ is often re-
duced to /EIk/, allemaal /Al@mal/ to /Am/, and helemaal /hel@mal/ to /hem@/) are never
produced in these extremely reduced forms by the participants. We therefore recom-
mend, when studying natural speech, to always use this task in combination with
another research method.
In conclusion, our production experiment shows that the shadowing task elicits non-
casual fast speech, in which reduction of schwa and /t/ in Dutch past participles is
only affected by gradient co-articulation.

Exemplar effects in word comprehension
Chapter 4
This chapter is a reformatted version of:
Iris Hanique, Ellen Aalders, and Mirjam Ernestus (submitted). How robust are exemplar effects
in word comprehension?
Abstract
This chapter studies the robustness of exemplar effects in word comprehension by
means of four long-term priming experiments with lexical decision tasks in Dutch. A
prime and target represented the same word type and were presented with the same
or different degree of reduction. In Experiment 1, participants heard only a small num-
ber of trials, a large proportion of repeated words, and stimuli produced by only one
speaker. They recognized targets more quickly if these represented the same degree
of reduction as their primes, which forms additional evidence for the exemplar effects
reported in the literature. Similar effects were found for two speakers who differ in
their pronunciations. In Experiment 2, with a smaller proportion of repeated words
and more trials between prime and target, participants recognized targets preceded
by primes with the same or a different degree of reduction equally quickly. Also, in
Experiments 3 and 4, in which listeners were not exposed to one but two types of pro-
nunciation variation (reduction degree and speaker voice), no exemplar effects arose.
We conclude that the role of exemplars in speech comprehension during natural con-
versations, which typically involve several speakers and few repeated content words,
may be smaller than previously assumed.

Chapter 4
Exemplar effects in word comprehension
Introduction
Several models of speech comprehension assume that the mental lexicon stores the
pronunciation of a word with two types of representations, namely abstract repre-
sentations and exemplars (e.g., Goldinger, 2007; McLennan et al., 2003). Abstract
representations are strings of sound symbols like phonemes or phonological fea-
tures, which only contain information about acoustic properties that distinguish be-
tween these symbols. In contrast, clouds of exemplars represent many occurrences
of words that the language user has uttered or heard. Each exemplar is a detailed
representation corresponding to the speech signal of one occurrence and thus con-
tains subtle acoustic information, for example about the word’s exact pronunciation or
the speaker’s voice. Many articles in the literature point to a role of exemplars in word
comprehension. This study investigates the robustness of these exemplar effects.
Exemplar effects have been established in several priming experiments (e.g., Brad-
low et al., 1999; Craik & Kirsner, 1974; Goh, 2005; Goldinger, 1996; Janse, 2008;
Mattys & Liss, 2008; McLennan et al., 2003; McLennan & Luce, 2005; Palmeri et al.,
1993). These experiments contained repeated words and the comprehension of the
second occurrence of a word (the target) is expected to be facilitated by the first oc-
currence (the prime). Primes and targets were completely identical, that is the same
token, or they differed in speech rate, time-compression, the realization of a certain
segment (e.g., intervocalic /t,d/ produced as [t,d] or as a flap in American English), or
the speaker’s voice. Most experiments showed that participants reacted more quickly
or produced fewer errors on the target if it was identical to the prime. Presumably,
participants stored primes with all their acoustic detail and, if targets were acousti-
cally identical to these primes, they could quickly recognize them via these exemplars
formed by the primes.
Not all experiments showed these exemplar effects. McLennan et al. (2003) stud-
ied allophonic variability and found exemplar effects only when participants processed
stimuli relatively fast. Conversely, for indexical variability (e.g., variability in speaker
voice and speech rate) McLennan & Luce (2005) only observed exemplar effects if
processing was slow. To account for this, McLennan and Luce suggest that more ab-
stract features are generally dominant early in processing and show effects when par-
ticipants are fast, while surface features (e.g., indexical details) dominate later stages
and show effects when participants are slow. However, surface representations can
still show effects at an early stage if they represent variants that are relatively frequent
(e.g., representations containing flaps instead of underlying /t/ and /d/).
Palmeri et al. (1993) also observed that exemplar effects do not always occur. In
an old-new judgment task they investigated whether exemplar effects remain if primes
and targets are separated by a large number of words, and therefore they varied the
lag between primes and targets (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, or 64 words). In addition, the
authors examined whether exemplar effects are influenced by the number of speakers
heard (1, 2, 6, 12, or 20 speakers). Primes and targets were produced by either the
46
Mental representation and processing of reduced words in casual speech
same or a different speaker. Their results suggest that exemplar effects are only
present at lags smaller than 64 words. Exemplar effects did not differ for the different
numbers of speakers.
Goldinger (1996) investigated similar issues. He studied the extent to which exem-
plar effects decrease if the time interval between primes and targets increased (from
five minutes, to one day, to a week). In the same experiment, Goldinger investigated
whether exemplar effects arise if stimuli were produced by two, six, or ten speakers.
Speaker voice for a given prime and corresponding target was either the same or
different and participants performed one of two tasks (identifying the words in white
noise or judging whether the word has been presented before). The identification task
showed exemplar effects for all time intervals, yet for the old-new judgments a week’s
interval was enough to block these effects. This provides additional evidence that
exemplar effects become more difficult to access over time. The effect of the number
of speakers in the experiment is less clear.
Our study also investigates the issue of when exemplar effects arise in speech
comprehension. More specifically, this study investigates whether exemplar effects
are robust under more natural conditions than those typically tested in the literature,
providing us with information about the role of exemplars in the comprehension pro-
cess. Following McLennan & Luce (2005), we conducted four long-term priming ex-
periments using lexical decision only. This way, participants had to process words
completely - unlike in, for example, phoneme monitoring or shadowing - and did not
have to rely on explicit memory (as in old-new judgment).
Our targets were Dutch verbs that start with the unstressed prefixes be- or ver-.
Words of this type are common in Dutch and their prefixes often contain reduced
schwas in casual speech (Chapter 2 of this dissertation; Pluymaekers et al., 2005).
In all four experiments, primes and targets could differ in their degree of reduction:
segments in the reduced tokens were shorter than in the unreduced tokens, and
some segments were completely missing. Our unreduced tokens therefore represent
tokens that are typically found in slow speech, while our reduced tokens represent
tokens that can be found at a high speech rate in casual speech. We hypothesized
that if participants react more quickly to targets showing the same degree of reduction
as their primes, participants must have accessed the exemplars of these primes.
First, we examined whether exemplar effects arise for different speakers, by using
two very different speakers. Speakers tend to differ in whether and how they reduce
words at high speech rates in casual conversations (e.g., Chapter 6 of this disserta-
tion). In Experiments 1 and 2, we investigated whether exemplar effects were larger if
the difference in degree of reduction between the reduced and unreduced tokens was
larger. Both experiments consisted of two subexperiments that were identical except
for speaker voice.
Second, we investigated whether exemplar effects also occur if the repetition of
words is less clear for participants in our experiment than in experiments reported in
the literature. In the experiments in the literature, the number of trials varied from 48
47
Chapter 4
Exemplar effects in word comprehension
(McLennan & Luce, 2005) to 436 (Craik & Kirsner, 1974) and between 50% and 100%
of the words were repeated. Furthermore, the majority of these experiments used an
explicit memory task (old-new judgments). Since it was clear to the participants that
many words were repeated, they may have used a strategy in which they directly
accessed exemplars. In Experiments 1 and 3 of our study, participants listened to
288 trials in which 33% of the words were repeated. In Experiments 2 and 4, the
number of trials was increased to 800 and 864 respectively, and the percentage of
repeated words decreased to approximately 12%.
Third, in previous experiments, listeners only heard one type of variation in the
speech signal. For instance, in Bradlow et al. (1999), speech rate, amplitude, and
speaker were varied, but each participant only heard one of these variations. In
Experiments 3 and 4, we investigated whether exemplar effects also arise if the stimuli
in the experiment differ in two indexical properties: degree of reduction and speaker
voice.
Finally, our experiments differ from previous experiments in that the prime and the
target were never completely identical. We chose to always have different productions
of the same word in order to obtain results that are ecologically more valid. In real life,
listeners are very unlikely to hear a given word produced twice in exactly the same
way.
Experiment 1
Method
Participants
We tested 48 native speakers of Dutch aged 18 to 28 (mean 21 years). Nine were left-
handed and ten were male. In this experiment, as in all other experiments presented
in this paper, none of the participants reported any hearing impairment, all were paid
for their participation, and they had not participated in any of the other experiments in
this study.
Materials
The materials consisted of an equal number of existing Dutch words and pseudo-
words; all were tri-syllabic infinitives. Half of them started with the prefix be- and
the other half with ver-, (e.g., beschrijven ‘to describe’ and vertolken ‘to interpret’).
The pseudo-infinitives did not contain phonotactically illegal phoneme sequences. All
primes were existing infinitives and primes and targets represented the same word
types.
Table 4.1 presents an overview of the number of the different types of stimuli. The
experiment contained 48 pairs of primes and targets. We wished to keep the number
of trials intervening between primes and targets small so that, at least in this respect,

our experiment resembled the experiments in the literature that showed exemplar
effects. These 48 prime-target pairs were therefore divided over two parts. Each part
consisted of two blocks: the first block had 24 primes and 48 foils and the second
block contained the corresponding 24 targets and 48 foils. Each word type occurred
in only one part of the experiment. In order to better hide the aim of the experiment,
in the second block of each part, we repeated existing words (the targets) as well as
24 pseudo-infinitives (foils).
We used two pronunciation variants for the primes, targets, and foils: an unreduced
one, carefully articulated at a slow speech rate, and a reduced one, with shorter and
possibly absent segments. A prime and target represented either the same or a dif-
ferent pronunciation variant. All stimuli were recorded by two Dutch native speakers:
one male (henceforth Speaker A) and one female (Speaker B). Stimuli were recorded
over the course of multiple recording sessions. Since speakers typically do not pro-
duce casual speech in front of a microphone, we had to tell our speakers that the
reduced stimuli had to sound as if uttered in casual speech. The instructions given
to the speakers determined whether tokens were categorized as reduced or unre-
duced. For each word type that occurred as prime and target or as repeated foil,
each speaker recorded several unreduced and reduced tokens (see Figure 4.1 for
an example). From these tokens we selected the two best tokens for each pronun-
ciation variant for a given speaker, so that primes and targets (and repeated foils)
were always different tokens. For the remaining foils, we recorded either reduced or
unreduced variants and selected the best token for a given speaker.

We analyzed the recordings to examine whether the reduced and unreduced sti-
muli differed in degree of reduction, and whether the speakers varied in the degree
of the pronunciation difference between reduced and unreduced stimuli. For the 384
recorded primes and target tokens, we created broad phonetic transcriptions using
the forced alignment procedure described by Schuppler et al. (2011). From these
transcriptions we extracted the duration of the whole word and determined whether
schwa was present. The averages are presented in Table 4.2. Subsequently, we
analyzed these two measures as dependent variable. For the presence of schwa, we
fitted logistic mixed effects regression models and for word duration we fitted mixed
effect regression models, with prefix (be- vs. ver-), speaker (Speaker A vs. B), and
variant (reduced vs. unreduced) as fixed effects and word type (e.g., vertolken or
beschrijven) as random effect. Table 4.3 shows the resulting models. As shown in
Figure 4.2, reduced stimuli were significantly shorter than unreduced stimuli. This dif-
ference was larger for stimuli produced by Speaker B. Similarly, schwa was more of-
ten absent in reduced stimuli and in stimuli produced by Speaker B. The automatically
generated transcriptions suggest that schwa was even frequently absent in Speaker
B’s unreduced realizations (10.4%). In general, our analyses clearly demonstrate
that the reduced tokens are more reduced than the unreduced tokens. In addition,
Speaker B shows a larger difference between the reduced and unreduced tokens
than Speaker A.

Exemplar effects in word comprehension
To test whether the differences between the unreduced and reduced tokens and
between two speakers could also be perceived by naïve listeners, we conducted a
rating experiment. We asked 50 participants aged between 18 and 29 (mean 21) to
rate 60 foils and all primes and targets on a 6-point scale ranging from very unintel-
ligible (rating score 1) to very intelligible (rating score 6). We created eight different
pseudo-randomized orders of the stimuli, so that together the eight lists contained ev-
ery token of each word (i.e., two primes and two targets produced by each speaker).
Each participant heard one list in which each word type occurred once and which
contained both reduced and unreduced stimuli produced by Speaker A as well as
Speaker B. Since the rating scores were not normally distributed, we converted the
scores to a factor in which scores 1, 2, and 3 were treated as unintelligible and scores
4, 5, and 6 as intelligible. We then fitted a logistic linear mixed effects model (Faraway,
2006) based on all primes and targets with word type and participant as crossed ran-
dom effects. This model yielded significant effects of speaker (β = 2.89, z = 10.51,
p < 0.0001) and pronunciation variant (β = 3.86, z = 9.46, p < 0.0001) and their
interaction (β = -2.39, z = -3.51, p < 0.001), indicating that reduced items were less
intelligible than unreduced items, especially if the items were produced by Speaker
B (Speaker A: reduced 96.7% intelligible and unreduced 99.2%; Speaker B: reduced
72.5% and unreduced 98.7%). The two speakers clearly differed in their pronuncia-
tion and intelligibility of the reduced variants and it is therefore interesting to compare
exemplar effects for these two speakers.
In the main experiment, the order in which the stimuli were presented to the parti-
cipants was identical for those listening to Speakers A and those listening to Speaker
B. We created four master lists for each speaker which tested priming for a given
word only once. In each of the blocks of these lists, half of the primes or targets and
approximately half of the foils were unreduced, and the other half were reduced. The
four lists represented four different pseudo-randomizations of the trials. These ran-
domizations had to obey four restrictions: (1) each block started with at least one foil;
(2) each prime and target was followed by at least one foil; (3) at most eight words
or eight pseudo-words occurred in succession; (4) prime and target were separated
by a maximum of 100 trials (average: 67; range: 19 to 100). Trials with primes and
targets were randomly assigned to one of the four possible combinations of the prime
and target’s pronunciation types: unreduced prime and unreduced target, unreduced
prime and reduced target, reduced prime and unreduced target, and reduced prime
and reduced target. For each master list, we created three other lists with the same
words in the same order: together the four lists formed a set that represents all four
possible combinations of the prime and target’s pronunciation variants for each word.
The combination of these four sets of four lists for each speaker resulted in 32 sti-
mulus lists. Each list was randomly assigned to one or two participants with half of
the participants receiving lists with Speaker A and the other half receiving lists with
Speaker B.
52
Mental representation and processing of reduced words in casual speech
Procedure
The experiment was conducted in a sound-attenuated booth, and participants were
tested individually. Participants listened to the stimuli over headphones and per-
formed a lexical decision task. They responded by pressing buttons on a button box;
yes-responses were always given with the dominant hand and no-responses with the
other hand. In each trial, one stimulus was presented and the next trial was initiated
one second after a response was given or 3.5 seconds after the end of the stimulus.
There was a pause between the two parts of the experiment, and one session lasted
approximately 15 minutes.
Analyses
We analyzed the accuracy of the answers to the targets by means of logistic mixed
effects models and the log-transformed response times to the targets by means of
mixed effects regression models, with word type and participant as crossed random
effects. Random slopes were tested for all fixed effects. The analysis of the re-
sponse times was based only on those trials that received a correct response and
for which the corresponding prime had also elicited a correct response. Response
times for which the residual standard errors deviated more than 2.5 times from the
values predicted by the statistical model were regarded as outliers and discarded.
Subsequently, the model was refitted.
We tested the influences of three predictors of interest, namely variant match,
which indicated whether the prime and target represent the same (i.e., match) or
a different pronunciation variant (i.e., mismatch), speaker (Speaker A vs. B), and the
distance in trials between the prime and target. In addition, we added several control
predictors to the statistical models which, in earlier studies, have been shown to af-
fect speech processing (e.g., Van de Ven et al., 2011): trial number, experiment part
(part 1 vs. 2), the pronunciation variant of the target (reduced vs. unreduced), pre-
fix (be- vs. ver-), the log-transformed target duration, the log-transformed response
times to the prime (RT prime) and to the preceding trial (RT preceding), and the
log-transformed word frequency (based on counts from the Spoken Dutch Corpus;
Oostdijk, 2002). Interactions were tested for the predictors of interest only. All non-
significant effects and random slopes were excluded from the model.
All correlating variables were orthogonalized before they were added to our statis-
tical model: If a continuous predictor A was correlated with predictor B, we replaced
predictor A by the residuals of a linear regression model predicting predictor A as a
function of predictor B. If the correlation involved two continuous predictors, the influ-
ence of the least interesting one (in the example above, predictor B) was partialled
out. Thus, in Experiment 1 we had four residualized predictors in our model: fre-
quency (correlated with prefix), target duration (correlated with speaker and prefix),
RT preceding (correlated with speaker ), and RT prime (correlated with RT preceding,
speaker, and prefix).
53
Chapter 4
Exemplar effects in word comprehension
Results and discussion
Participants made errors in 5% of the target trials. Analysis of these trials did not
show an effect of any of the variables of interest. The same holds for the errors in
Experiment 2, 3, and 4.
As none of the participants made errors in more than 20% of the trials, none were
excluded from our analyses of the response times. We restricted our analyses to
those target words for which more than 80% of the responses were correct, which
led to the exclusion of the word bekransen ‘to garland’. Table 4.4 shows the statis-
tical model based on the remaining 1980 trials (85.9% of all trials). Response times
measured from word onset were 943 ms on average and ranged from 522 to 2375
ms. The effects of our control predictors showed that responses were faster to words
carrying the prefix be- (mean: 913 ms) than ver- (971 ms); to words produced by
Speaker B (mean: 879 ms) compared to Speaker A (1003 ms); and to words with a
higher frequency of occurrence. In addition, responses were faster if the word itself
or its prime was shorter. Finally, responses were faster the faster the response to the
prime or the preceding trial.
Importantly, we found a significant main effect of variant match, which indicated that
responses were faster if the prime and the target represented the same pronunciation
variant (mean: 933 ms) compared to different variants (952 ms). Variant match did

not significantly interact with the random effects word type or participant, suggesting
that the effect does not depend on a subset of word types or participants. Further-
more, the interaction between variant match and speaker was not significant, which
suggests that the effect of variant match does not differ for the two speakers. We
examined whether the effect was also significant for the two speakers separately and
it was (Speaker A: β = 0.018, t = 2.29, p < 0.05; Speaker B: β = 0.021, t = 2.61, p <
0.05).
The effect of variant match appears to be reliable and indicates that exemplar ef-
fects arise even in experiments in which only 33% of the words are repeated. Al-
though our phonetic analyses and the rating study clearly showed differences be-
tween the stimuli produced by the two speakers, the effect of variant match is similar
for both speakers. A possible explanation is that each participant heard only one
speaker. As listeners typically adapt very rapidly to a new speaker (e.g., Dahan,
Drucker, & Scarborough, 2008), participants had probably already adapted to the
speaker during the first block. Consequently, the differences between the speakers
did not play a substantial role.
To further investigate the robustness of exemplars, in Experiment 2 we increased
the number of non-repeated foils. This experiment consisted of 800 trials. As only
12% of the words were repeated, this setup closely approximates natural conversa-
tions, in which speakers avoid repetition by often replacing content words by pro-
nouns. As we were not able to create large numbers of stimuli using the prefixes be-
and ver- only, Experiments 2 also contained foils with the prefixes in-, aan-, and ont-.
In addition, we increased the average number of trials between primes and targets.
Since we thought these manipulations would make it harder to find exemplar effects,
we tested more participants.

Method
Participants
All 130 participants were native speakers of Dutch (21 male), aged between 18 and
31 (mean 21); 14 were left-handed.
Materials
We used the same stimuli as in Experiment 1 plus additional foils. The Dutch lexi-
con contains approximately 500 tri-syllabic infinitives with the prefix be- or ver- and a
unique stem (Celex; Baayen, Piepenbrock, & Gulikers, 1995), including very low fre-
quency infinitives (e.g., verzoeten ‘to sweeten’, bewolken ‘to cloud over’, and verza-
gen ‘to saw up’). The additional foils therefore also represented three other prefixes:
in-, aan-, and ont-. In order to ensure that each of the five prefixes was presented

160 times in the entire experiment, we added 32 infinitives starting with be- and ver-
and 480 infinitives carrying either the prefix in-, aan-, or ont- (see Table 4.5). The
number of existing and pseudo-infinitives starting with in-, aan-, or ont- was unequal,
as only a limited number of existing ont-infinitives are available. To avoid repetition
of the prefixes be- and ver- only, 30 foils with the prefix in-, aan-, and ont- were also
presented twice.
Furthermore, we increased the number of trials between primes and targets and
presented all stimuli in one part with two blocks. The first block consisted of 48 primes
and 352 foils, and the second of 48 targets and 352 foils. The number of trials be-
tween the primes and targets was entirely random (average: 405; range: 79 to 765
trials).
Both speakers recorded all new foils only once, in either a reduced or unreduced
pronunciation variant. As each participant only heard stimuli from one speaker, both
occurrences of the 30 repeated fillers with the prefixes in-, aan-, and ont- were the
same recording (token).
Procedure
We used the same procedure as in Experiment 1, except that all stimuli were pre-
sented in one part with a pause between the two blocks. A session lasted approxi-
mately 37 minutes.
56
Mental representation and processing of reduced words in casual speech
Results and discussion
We analyzed the response times of Experiment 2 with the same method and pre-
dictors1 as used in Experiment 1 except for the predictor experiment part. Three
participants and the word bekransen ‘to garland’ were excluded from analyses as
their error rates were above 20%. Table 4.4 shows the statistical model based on the
remaining 5111 trials (81.9% of all trials). The average response time was 981 ms
(range: 525 to 2108 ms). All control predictors that were significant in Experiment 1
were also significant in this experiment.
Although the statistical power of Experiment 2 was greater than that of Experiment
1 (due to the larger number of participants), we found no main effect of variant match
or an interaction between variant match and speaker. Hence, in an experimental set-
ting with a smaller proportion of repeated words and more trials between prime and
target, targets preceded by primes representing the same or a different pronuncia-
tion variant are recognized equally quickly. This experiment therefore suggests that
the exemplar effects found in Experiment 1 only arise in short experiments with little
variation.
In Experiment 3, we further investigated the robustness of exemplar effects. We
returned to the stimuli and set up of Experiment 1 and investigated whether exemplar
effects are found if the prime and target may differ in two, instead of one, indexical
property. The experiment tested four experimental conditions: (1) speaker match and
variant match between primes and targets, (2) speaker match and variant mismatch,
(3) speaker mismatch and variant match, (4) speaker mismatch and variant mismatch.

All 49 participants were native speakers of Dutch (six male), aged between 18 and

Materials and procedure
We used the same stimuli and recordings as in Experiment 1. In contrast to the pre-
vious experiments, half of the trials in a stimulus list were produced by Speaker A
and the other half by Speaker B. Furthermore, whereas primes were either reduced
or unreduced, targets were always reduced. We created three different pseudo-
randomizations of the trials with the same restrictions as Experiment 1. We created

a session were identical to those of Experiment 1.
Analyses
Except for the pronunciation variant of the target, which was always reduced, we used
the same predictors2 as in Experiment 1; note that speaker refers to the speaker of
the target. In addition, we used the new predictor of interest speaker match (match
vs. mismatch between the speaker of the prime and target).
Results and discussion
As the error rates of all participants were lower than 20%, no participants were ex-
cluded from analyses. The word bekransen ‘to garland’ had an error rate above 20%
and was again omitted from further analyses. The statistical model of Experiment 3
was based on the remaining 2004 trials (85.2% of all trials) and is shown in Table 4.6.
Response times were, on average, 943 ms (range: 540 to 1943 ms). The control
predictors that were significant in the preceding experiments were again significant
and showed similar effects. In addition, we found a difference between the two expe-
riment parts, indicating that responses obtained in the second part (mean: 921 ms)
were faster than in the first part (966 ms).
Importantly, neither variant match nor speaker match showed a significant effect,
nor did they interact with each other or with speaker. An effect of variant match is ab-
sent although the statistical power of Experiment 1 was similar to the power of Expe-
riment 3 (Experiment 1: 24 match responses from 24 participants for both speakers;
Experiment 3: 12 match responses from 49 participants also for both speakers).
The difference found between Experiments 1 and 3 was supported by an analy-
sis of the combined dataset of the responses to Speaker A in Experiment 1 and the
responses in Experiment 3, which shows an interaction between experiment and vari-
ant match (β = -0.031, t = -2.7, p < 0.05): whereas variant match explains variance
in Speaker A’s part of Experiment 1, it does not in Experiment 3. An analysis of the
combined dataset of the responses to Speaker B in Experiment 1 and the responses
in Experiment 3 gave the same result (β = -0.023, t = -2.1, p < 0.05). These results
suggest that exemplar effects were greater in Experiment 1, if they were present in
Experiment 3 at all.
Neither Experiment 2 nor Experiment 3 showed exemplar effects. Nevertheless,
we decided to conduct Experiment 4, which is a combination of Experiments 2 and 3:
2 We residualized the following predictors: frequency (correlated with prefix and experiment part), target
duration (correlated with speaker, prefix, and experiment part), RT preceding (correlated with prefix and
experiment part), and RT prime (correlated with RT preceding and experiment part).

participants heard the targets in the same four conditions as in Experiment 3, while
the experiment was identical to Experiment 2 in the number and diversity of the foils
and in the distances between primes and targets. If the null results in Experiments 2
and 3 were due to Type II errors, we would expect to find exemplar effects in Expe-
riment 4. Moreover, we can combine the results from Experiment 4 with those from
Experiments 2 and 3 to see whether these increased datasets present evidence for
exemplar effects.
Experiment 4
Method
Participants
The participants were 68 native speakers of Dutch (17 male), aged between 18 and
27 years (mean 21); seven were left-handed.
Materials and procedure
The stimuli were the same set as those presented in Experiment 2. In line with Expe-
riment 3, half of the stimuli presented to each participant were produced by Speaker
59
Chapter 4
Exemplar effects in word comprehension
A and the other half by Speaker B. Furthermore, as in Experiment 3, all targets were
reduced. To make sure that not all reoccurring stimuli were reduced, we added 32
foils (16 existing and 16 pseudo-words) with the prefixes be- and ver- that also reoc-
curred and were unreduced in Block 2 (these were reduced or unreduced in Block 1).
Each participant was presented with a stimulus list of 864 trials. The procedure was
identical to that of Experiment 2. One session lasted approximately 40 minutes.
Results and discussion
To analyze the response times, we used the predictors3 from Experiment 3, except
for experiment part. All participants and target words were included in the analyses,
except for the target words bekransen ‘to garland’ and beschaven ‘to civilize’, as they
had error rates higher than 20%. The statistical model of Experiment 4, based on
the remaining 2459 trials (75.3% of all trials), is presented in Table 4.6. The average
response time was 956 ms (range: 549 to 2444 ms). The same significant control
effects were found as in Experiment 3, with the exception of word frequency.
Similar to Experiments 2 and 3, we found no effects of the predictors of interest.
Hence, in the experimental setting with the most variation and in which only a small
proportion of stimuli were primed, no evidence for the use of exemplars was found.
In an analysis of the combined data of Experiments 2, 3, and 4, we found no main
effect of variant match nor an interaction of variant match with experiment. This
indicates that exemplars did not play a substantial role in any of these experiments.
Additional analysis of all experimental data
So far, we investigated the presence of exemplar effects by analyzing the datasets
with two categorical predictors (variant match and speaker match). The variation
between a reduced and an unreduced realization differs between speakers (see Fi-
gure 4.2), word types, and word tokens. We therefore also analyzed all datasets with
a continuous predictor indicating the similarity in reduction between the prime and
target, namely the absolute difference between the log-transformed duration of the
prime and the log-transformed duration of the target. Only the analysis of Experiment
1 showed a significant main effect of this continuous predictor (β = 0.17, t = 2.2, p <
0.05), indicating that responses were faster if the duration difference between prime
and target was smaller. In addition, none of the experiments showed an interaction
between this predictor and speaker. These results indicate that even a more sensitive
predictor shows no exemplar effects in Experiments 2, 3, and 4, and thus confirm the
results obtained with the categorical predictors variant match and speaker match.
3 We residualized the following predictors: target duration (correlated with speaker and prefix) and RT prime
(correlated with RT preceding and prefix).

Mental representation and processing of reduced words in casual speech
General discussion
In this chapter, we investigated exemplar effects in a series of priming experiments
with lexical decision tasks, in which primes and targets represented the same or a
different pronunciation variant. We examined the robustness of exemplar effects un-
der more natural conditions than in experiments reported in the literature so far (e.g.,
Craik & Kirsner, 1974; McLennan & Luce, 2005; Palmeri et al., 1993) and did so in
four ways. First, we studied the generalizability of exemplar effects over two very
different speakers. Second, we investigated whether exemplar effects arise if the rep-
etition of words is less clear for participants than in experiments showing exemplar
effects reported in the literature. Third, we investigated if exemplar effects arise when
listeners are exposed to not one but two types of pronunciation variation in the ex-
periment (i.e., pronunciation variant and speaker voice). Finally, in contrast to earlier
studies, primes and targets were never completely identical.
In Experiment 1, 33% of the 288 words were repeated and each participant only
listened to one of the two speakers. This experiment showed a clear exemplar effect:
responses were faster to targets that represented the same pronunciation variant as
their primes. In contrast to earlier studies (e.g., Mattys & Liss, 2008; McLennan et
al., 2003; McLennan & Luce, 2005; Palmeri et al., 1993), in our experiments, primes
and targets were always different recordings, even when they represented the same
pronunciation variant produced by the same speaker. The results of Experiment 1
thus show that even if the target is not completely identical to the prime, its processing
can be facilitated by the exemplar formed by its prime.
The exemplar effects arose regardless of the number of trials intervening between
the prime and target. This shows that the priming effects remained constant during
the first five minutes following the presentation of a prime. In this respect, our results
differ from those obtained by Palmeri et al. (1993), who found that exemplar effects
were only present if the interval between prime and target was smaller than 64 trials.
A likely explanation for this difference in results is that Palmeri et al. (1993) used an
old-new judgment task while we used lexical decision.
The exemplar effect was significant for both speakers, who clearly differ in their
pronunciations and intelligibility. Hence, exemplar effects can be found for very dif-
ferent speakers. Our results appear to contrast with those obtained by Mattys & Liss
(2008), who found that the size of exemplar effects depends on the level of intelligibil-
ity of the speakers: participants who listened to dysarthric speakers showed longer
response times and larger exemplar effects. Following McLennan & Luce (2005), the
authors argue that exemplar effects are larger if performance latencies are longer. In
our study, the less intelligible speaker did not elicit longer response times. Therefore,
these authors would correctly predict similar exemplar effects for both speakers.
Experiment 1 provides data that are informative about speech processing in natu-
ral conditions. The percentage of words repeated within an interval of 100 words in
lectures and classes from the Spoken Dutch Corpus (i.e., component n of the cor-
61
Chapter 4
Exemplar effects in word comprehension
pus; 53045 words) is as high as 46.6% (18.8% if only content words are taken into
account). Our results thus hold for a substantial number of word tokens that listeners
hear during classes and when listening to, for instance, news bulletins.
While the repetition of words in Experiment 1 was already less obvious than in pre-
vious studies, participants may still have noticed it, which may have increased their
use of exemplars. This was further investigated in Experiment 2, where the repetition
of words was made less obvious by simultaneously increasing the number of trials
between a prime and target from 67 to 405 on average and reducing the proportion
of reoccurring words to 12%. This more closely approximates natural conversations,
in which the frequent replacement of content words by pronouns decreases the rep-
etition of content words. Although the statistical power of Experiment 2 was greater
than Experiment 1 (due to the larger number of participants), Experiment 2 showed
no exemplar effects. This indicates that exemplars effects are negligible when the
repetition of words is less clear for participants.
The difference in delay between primes and targets in Experiments 1 and 2 may
explain why we found priming effects in Experiment 1 but not in Experiment 2. The
decay of the primes’ exemplars (or of their activation) may have been too large at
the moment the target was presented in Experiment 2. Only a small percentage of
prime-target pairs (1.1%) were separated by maximally 100 trials and only 9.8% was
separated by maximally 180 trials. Moreover, the block of primes was separated from
the block of targets by a pause. Earlier findings that exemplar effects can be present
even after one week (Goldinger, 1996) seem to contradict this explanation. How-
ever, exemplars may contain information about the context in which the occurrence
was heard (e.g., the laboratory). If so, words presented in the laboratory after one
week are more similar to exemplars with the same context information than exem-
plars encountered in a different context in that intervening week. When participants
re-entered the laboratory after a week in Goldinger’s experiment, they may have re-
activated the exemplars specific to that laboratory. Consequently, at the moment a
target word was presented, the number of different activated exemplars was probably
larger in Experiment 2 than in Goldinger’s experiment after one week, resulting in
smaller priming effects. Further research is necessary to test this explanation.
Like Experiment 1, Experiment 2 did not show an effect of the distance between
the prime and the target. This was probably due to the high number of prime-target
pairs that were separated by a large number of trials. These pairs may not have
shown priming effects at all, precluding a main effect of or interaction with the distance
between prime and targets.
Experiment 3 studied the role of exemplars if the speech signal contained more
than one type of variation (i.e., degree of reduction and speaker voice). Although the
proportion of reoccurring words was the same as in Experiment 1, we found no effect
of the similarity in pronunciation variant nor of the similarity in speaker voice. The sta-
tistical powers of Experiment 1 and 3 were the same, as were the average response
latencies. A possible explanation comes from the earlier finding that if memory load
62
Mental representation and processing of reduced words in casual speech
is higher, listeners tend to use less acoustic detail in speech comprehension (e.g.,
Mattys & Wiget, 2011). The combination of two types of variation in Experiment 3
made Experiment 3 more demanding than Experiment 1, since the greater variation
made linking the acoustic signal to semantic representations more effortful for the
participants. As a consequence, participants may have paid less attention to acoustic
similarity.
Another possible explanation for the absence of exemplar effects has to do with the
difference in reduction patterns between our speakers. As illustrated in Figure 4.2, a
reduced pronunciation produced by Speaker A may be very similar in word duration
to an unreduced pronunciation produced by Speaker B. Primes and targets which
constitute a variant mismatch may therefore be very similar, whereas those that con-
stitute a match may be very dissimilar. This may explain why we did not find an effect
of variant match. In order to test this hypothesis, we conducted additional analyses
(presented above, after Experiment 4) investigating whether the difference in word du-
ration between the prime and target predicts reaction times. This appeared not to be
case for Experiments 2, 3, and 4, which may be taken as evidence that the absence
of an effect of variant match in Experiment 3 is not due to differences in reduction pat-
terns between the two speakers. However, the speakers may not only differ in their
speech rate in the two pronunciation variants, but also in their exact realization of the
different segments of these variants. For instance, Speaker B may always weaken
liquids after vowels, whereas Speaker A may produce them very clearly, at least in
the unreduced tokens. Therefore, the absence of an effect of pronunciation variant in
Experiment 3 may be due to substantial differences between the tokens representing
one single variant produced by the two speakers. This explanation implies that lis-
teners do not classify a given word token as unreduced or reduced depending on the
speaker, which is in line with models assuming acoustically detailed representations
for pronunciation variants.
This second possible explanation can also account for why Experiment 3 did not
show a main effect of speaker match. If substantial exemplar effects only arise if a
speaker match is combined with a variant match, they can only be expected in one of
the four conditions in the experiment. Possibly, our experiment had too little power to
show the difference between this condition and the three other ones. Future research
has to show which of these explanations is most likely.
Regardless of the underlying cause, the absence of exemplar effects in Experiment
3 raises the question of what role exemplars play in speech comprehension in daily
life. Most speech that people perceive is produced in spontaneous conversations
involving several speakers in which degree of reduction varies greatly. The absence
of exemplar effects in Experiment 3 suggests that, under these conditions, abstract
lexical representations play a more important role than exemplars.
Finally, to complete the series of experiments, in Experiment 4 we examined the two
types of variation simultaneously, in an experiment in which only a small proportion
of stimuli reoccurred. In line with the results of Experiments 2 and 3, this experiment
63
Chapter 4
Exemplar effects in word comprehension
also showed no exemplar effects. These results confirm our findings that exemplar
effects are absent in experimental setups like those of Experiments 2 and 3.
The results of this study have implications for modelling spoken word comprehen-
sion. The absence of exemplar effects in Experiments 2 to 4 disqualifies pure exem-
plar models but leaves hybrid models a viable option. Hybrid models do require fur-
ther specification to explain under which conditions exemplars can affect comprehen-
sion. Our findings can also be accounted for in a model assuming only abstract lexical
representations, provided that it assumes domain-general episodic memory. The ex-
emplar effect found in Experiment 1 should then be reinterpreted as an episodic effect
that arose because it was so obvious to participants that many words were repeated:
participants were encouraged to base decisions on episodic rather than abstract re-
presentations.
In conclusion, we conducted four priming experiments, and found exemplar effects
in only the simplest experiment with no speaker variation and the largest proportion
of repeated words. In spontaneous conversations, listeners may hear more than one
speaker and content words are often replaced by pronouns. Hence, this paper sug-
gests that, in a situation where more variation is available to the listener, like natural
conversation, exemplars play a smaller role than has been previously assumed.

The role of morphology in acoustic
reduction

e Linguaggio, 2012(2), 147–164.
Abstract
This chapter examines the role of morphological structure in the reduced pronun-
ciation of morphologically complex words by discussing and re-analyzing data from
the literature. Acoustic reduction refers to the phenomenon that, in spontaneous
speech, phonemes may be shorter or absent. We review studies investigating effects
of the repetition of a morpheme, of whether a segment plays a crucial role in the
identification of its morpheme, and of a word’s morphological decomposability. We
conclude that these studies report either no effects of morphological structure or ef-
fects that are open to alternative interpretations. Our analysis also reveals the need
for a uniform definition of morphological decomposability. Furthermore, we examine
whether the reduction of segments in morphologically complex words correlates with
these segments’ contribution to the identification of the whole word, and discuss pre-
vious studies and new analyses supporting this hypothesis. We conclude that the
data show no convincing evidence that morphological structure conditions reduction,
which contrasts with the expectations of several models of speech production and of
morphological processing (e.g., WEAVER++ and dual-route models). The data col-
lected so far support psycholinguistic models which assume that all morphologically
complex words are processed as complete units.

Chapter 5
The role of morphology in acoustic reduction
Introduction
One common type of variation in spontaneous speech is the reduced pronunciation
of words. For instance, ordinary may be pronounced as [Anôi] and apparently as
[phER̃I]. As reported by Johnson (2004), over sixty percent of the words in sponta-
neous American English deviate from their full form in at least one segment, and six
percent of the words are pronounced with at least one syllable missing. This highly
frequent phenomenon also occurs in other languages (see Ernestus & Warner, 2011,
for an introduction to the phenomenon).
Whether segments are reduced depends on many variables, like the rate of speech
(e.g., Dalby, 1984), the speech style (e.g., Van Son & Pols, 1999), the surrounding
segments (e.g., Van Bergem, 1994), and the predictability of the segment or word
(e.g., Bell et al., 2009). Knowledge about these variables informs us about the speech
production process and the nature of the mental lexicon.
In this chapter, we investigate whether the production of reduced pronunciation
variants in conversational speech is also affected by morphological structure. We for-
mulate several hypotheses about how morphological structure may affect the degree
of reduction and discuss new analyses and data from the literature bearing on these
hypotheses.
Our first hypothesis concerns the effect of the repetition of morphemes on their de-
gree of reduction. Previous studies have shown that words tend to be more reduced
the more often they are repeated in a conversation (e.g., Fowler & Housum, 1987).
If morphological structure plays a role in acoustic reduction, this may also hold for
the repetition of morphemes. That is, morphemes may be more reduced if they are
repeated, even in different words.
Our second hypothesis is based on previous studies which show that segments
tend to be less reduced if they are more relevant for the identification of a linguistic
unit (e.g., Van Son & Pols, 2003). If morphemes play a role in acoustic reduction,
we expect that a segment’s degree of reduction also depends on its contribution to
the identification of its morpheme in morphologically complex words. A segment is
more important for the identification of a morpheme if it is its only segment (i.e., for
single segment affixes, like the plural s in words) or its initial segment than if it is its
final segment. Segments forming single segment affixes as well as morpheme-initial
segments are therefore expected to be less reduced than segments at the end of
longer morphemes (Losiewicz, 1992).
Importantly, words differ from each other in their morphological decomposability.
The effect of a word’s morphological structure on acoustic reduction is expected to
depend on this morphological decomposability. Semantically opaque words (e.g.,
department) are more difficult to parse in their morphemes than semantically trans-
parent words (e.g., attachment). Hay (2003), however, argues that also semantically
transparent words can differ in their decomposability. The effect of a word’s morpho-
66
Mental representation and processing of reduced words in casual speech
logical structure on acoustic reduction is expected to be greater for words that are
more easily decomposable.
Hay (2003) quantified decomposability as the relation of the frequency of the word
to the sum of frequencies of the word’s base and what she called its inflectional vari-
ants (e.g., for softly, the sum of frequencies of soft, softer, and softest). If the word
frequency is higher than the inflectional variants frequency, Hay assumes the word
to be less decomposable and that its morphological structure only plays a minor role
in processing. In contrast, if the inflectional variants frequency is higher than the
word frequency, Hay assumes that the word is more easily decomposable. Then,
morphological structure could play a more important role in speech production, and
segments that are crucial for the identification of morphemes would be less likely to
be reduced. This hypothesis has also been addressed by other researchers (Bürki,
Ernestus, et al., 2011; Schuppler et al., 2012), who all use different quantifications of
decomposability.
If, contrary to the hypotheses formulated above, morphological structure has no
role in reduction, the reduction of morphologically complex words is expected to be
conditioned by the same factors as monomorphemic words. One such factor is a seg-
ment’s importance in distinguishing the complete word from its competitors (hence-
forth word information load ; e.g., Van Son & Pols, 2003). Segments that are more
relevant for the identification of the complete word are hypothesized to be less re-
duced.
After having discussed data bearing on these hypotheses, we discuss the impli-
cations for models of speech production. Models differ in the way they assume
words are represented in the mental lexicon and processed during speech produc-
tion: Some models assume that complex words are stored and processed as com-
plete units (e.g., Bybee, 2001; Skousen, 1989), whereas other models assume that
regular complex words are processed on the basis of their morphemes (e.g., Chom-
sky & Halle, 1968; Pinker, 1991; Taft & Ardasinski, 2006), or they combine the two
ways of processing (e.g., Levelt et al., 1999; Schreuder & Baayen, 1995). We exam-
ined which existing psycholinguistic model best explains the available data on the role
of morphological structure on acoustic reduction.
In short, this paper provides an overview and discussion of studies that investi-
gated the role of morphological structure in acoustic reduction. We first examine the
question whether morphemes tend to be more reduced if they are repeated, even
in different word types. Then, we investigate the hypothesis that a segment is less
reduced if it forms an affix by itself, and subsequently focus on the hypothesis that
reduction is influenced by the word’s morphological decomposability. We thereafter
discuss data supporting the contrasting hypothesis that acoustic reduction is not con-
ditioned by morphological structure, but rather by a segment’s word information load.
In addition to reviewing existing literature, we present new analyses of our own data.
Finally, we discuss the implications of our findings for several psycholinguistic models
of speech production.

Chapter 5
The role of morphology in acoustic reduction
The repetition of morphemes
Several studies have reported that words tend to be shorter if they are repeated in
a spontaneous conversation (e.g., Fowler & Housum, 1987). If morphological struc-
ture plays an important role in acoustic reduction, we expect that this also holds for
morphemes within complex words.
Viebahn, Ernestus, & McQueen (2012) examined whether Dutch past participles
that occur closely together (but do not necessarily directly succeed each other) in
casual speech tend to be reduced in the same degree. Importantly, they investigated
if the similarity in reduction between these co-occuring words is affected by the si-
milarity of their morphological structure. The authors differentiated three degrees of
morphological similarity: identical words, different words starting with the same pre-
fix, and completely different words also carrying different prefixes. This study focused
on schwa in the prefix of 1848 past participles extracted from the Ernestus Corpus of
Spontaneous Dutch (Ernestus, 2000) and the interview and read speech components
of the Spoken Dutch Corpus (Oostdijk, 2002). Results showed that schwa tended to
be short if the schwa in the preceding past participle was also short, but only if the two
co-occurring past participles were tokens of the same word. That is, the schwa in, for
instance, the past participle gelopen ‘walked’ tended to be as short as in a preceding
token of gelopen, but not as short as in another preceding past participle, like gefietst
‘cycled’. Hence, repetition of just the prefix does not influence its degree of reduction.
The unit that plays an important role in speech production appears to be the com-
plete complex word. This finding challenges the hypothesis that the morphological
structure of complex words plays a large role in their pronunciation.
Single segment affixes
As explained in the Introduction, if morphological structure plays a role in acoustic
reduction, we would expect that a segment tends to be less reduced if it forms an affix
by itself than if it is positioned at the end of a longer morpheme. Losiewicz (1992)
tested this hypothesis in a production experiment studying the correlation between
the reduction of English word-final /t/ and /d/ and these segments’ morphological
status. The stimuli consisted of six minimal word pairs (see Table 5.1): one word of
each pair was a regular past tense verb ending in the suffix -ed (either pronounced
as [t] as in tacked or as [d] as in swayed), in which /t/ or /d/ functioned as a single
segment affix, while the other word was a monomorphemic homophone ending in
stem-final /t/ or /d/. These twelve words were placed in lists and read aloud once
by sixteen participants. Losiewicz found that the morphemic /t/ or /d/ of the regular
past tense verbs was on average five milliseconds longer than the non-morphemic
/t/ or /d/, which suggests that a segment’s duration is affected by its morphological
status (i.e., whether it forms a single segment affix or is the final segment of the stem).

shortest final segment is also the word with the highest frequency of occurrence.

Losiewicz selected her stimuli so that they had frequencies below 10 tokens in Car-
roll, Davies, & Richman (1971) and Francis & Kucera (1982). These frequency lists
are based on relatively small corpora: one and five million word tokens, respectively.
Currently, frequency lists are available based on larger corpora and consequently
are more reliable. For instance, the CELEX database (Baayen et al., 1995) provides
counts based on 17.9 million word tokens. In Table 5.1, we list the word frequencies
from CELEX. These counts show that for four of the six word pairs (in bold), the word
with the shortest final segment has the highest frequency of occurrence4. Since many
studies have shown that more frequent words tend to be more reduced (e.g., Bell et
al., 2009; Pluymaekers et al., 2005), the morphological effect found by Losiewicz may
also be a word frequency effect.
A second study that examined the role of a segment’s morphological status in
acoustic reduction is Schuppler et al. (2012). Initially, the authors focused on word-
final /t/ in all Dutch content words and extracted 5130 word tokens ending in /t/ from
the Ernestus Corpus of Spontaneous Dutch. In contrast to Losiewicz, they did not find
that the morphological status of /t/ significantly influenced its presence or absence.
Schuppler et al. (2012) subsequently focused only on Dutch singular present tense
verb forms ending in /t/. In regular Dutch verbs, the first person singular is equal
to the stem of the verb (e.g., /fits/ fiets ‘cycle’), and the third person singular is
created by adding the suffix /t/ (e.g., /fits+t/ fietst ‘cycles’). Importantly, if a stem
ends in /t/ or /d/, this stem-final segment and the third person singular suffix /t/
are degeminated, which results in the pronunciation of a single /t/ (e.g., /nit+t/, [nit]
niet ‘staples’; /bid+t/ [bit] biedt ‘offers’). If the stem ends in /d/, the third person
4 Frequency counts based on the 85 million words of the spoken component of the Corpus of Contemporary
American English (Davies, 2008) also show that for four word pairs the most frequent word is the one with
the shortest final segment.

singular is spelled with dt. This form therefore differs from the first person singular in
orthography and the two forms can be easily identified in a corpus of spontaneous
speech with orthographic transcriptions. Note that the crucial difference between the
first and third person singular verb forms is that all first person forms end in a [t]
that is part of the stem only (e.g., /bid/ [bit] bied ‘offer’), whereas all corresponding
third person forms end in a [t] that is part of the stem and is a suffix (e.g., /bid+t/
[bit] biedt ‘offers’). Schuppler et al. (2012) analyzed 366 tokens. In agreement with
Losiewicz (1992), they showed that suffix /t/ was significantly less likely to be absent
than non-suffix /t/.
However, like Losiewicz’s results, this finding by Schuppler et al. (2012) should be
interpreted carefully. It is again based on a dataset consisting of a small number of
tokens, which represent nine word types only. Moreover, this dataset is not balanced,
as for the third person singular present tense verb forms antwoordt ‘answers’, biedt
‘offers’, and snijdt ‘cuts’, it does not contain the corresponding first person forms (i.e.,
antwoord, bied, and snijd). In addition, the word wordt is often followed by a /d/-
initial function word (e.g., wordt dat ‘becomes that’). Due to degemination, this type
of sequence is nearly always produced with only one alveolar stop, independently of
whether the stop of wordt is present. Furthermore, the /t/ of the first person verb form
houd ‘love’ is never produced in casual speech, which is reflected in informal writing
(as in ik hou van je ‘I love you’). Finally, the word type vind ‘find’ often occurs in highly
frequent word combinations (e.g., vind ik ‘believe I’), in which the /t/ is often absent,
which is sometimes also reflected in writing (e.g., vinnik ). These word combinations
are likely to be lexicalized items, in which word-final /t/ is no longer present. Due
to these problems with the dataset, Schuppler and colleagues’ (2012) findings do
not convincingly support the hypothesis that the morphological status of a segment
influences its degree of reduction.
We also investigated the role of a segment’s morphological status using the dataset
from Chapter 2 of this dissertation, which consists of Dutch past participles. Most
Dutch regular past participles consist of the prefix ge- /x@/, a verbal stem, and the
suffix /t/ (e.g., /x@+wEns+t/ gewenst ‘wished’). In past participles of verbal stems
ending in /t/, /t/ is analyzed as resulting from degemination of the stem-final /t/ and
suffix /t/ (e.g., /x@+prat+t/ [x@prat] gepraat ‘talked’). We focused on word-final /t/
and analyzed 1166 tokens of past participles ending in /t/ (in 165 tokens, /t/ was
part of the stem and the suffix, as in /x@+prat+t/ [x@prat] gepraat ‘talked’, and in
1001 tokens, /t/ only represented the suffix, as in /x@+wEns+t/ gewenst ‘wished’).
All tokens were extracted from the Ernestus Corpus of Spontaneous Dutch and the in-
terview and read speech components of the Spoken Dutch Corpus. Analyses showed
that the morphological status of /t/ did not affect its duration, but it did affect its pres-
ence: word-final /t/ was more likely to be absent if it was not part of the stem but
only represented the suffix. This is unexpected given the hypothesis that segments
forming single segment affixes are generally less likely to be reduced. We will return
to this finding in the section on word information load.

Mental representation and processing of reduced words in casual speech
This overview shows that, so far, no study has convincingly demonstrated an effect
of a segment’s morphological status on acoustic reduction. Some studies showed no
effects of morphological status at all (the overall dataset of Schuppler et al. (2012),
and our new analyses reported in this section), while the effects observed in other
studies are open to alternative interpretations (Losiewicz, 1992; the verb form dataset
in Schuppler et al., 2012).
Morphological decomposability
As explained in the Introduction, morphological structure may only play a role in the
pronunciation of words that are easily decomposable. Morphemes are more impor-
tant in easily decomposable words, and only in these words, may segments at mor-
pheme boundaries be expected to be less often reduced. In order to investigate this
hypothesis, researchers have quantified decomposability in several ways.
According to Hay (2003), a word’s morphological decomposability is reflected by
the relation between its own frequency and the cumulative frequency of its inflectional
variants. Hay hypothesized that if a word occurs more frequently than its variants, it
is less decomposable and its segments at morpheme boundaries are therefore more
likely to be reduced. Hay tested this hypothesis on the basis of /t/ in pairs of English
adverbs (see Table 5.2), of which one word is more frequent than its inflectional vari-
ants (e.g., the frequency of swiftly is higher than the cumulative frequency of swift,
swifter, and swiftest), and the other word is less frequent than its variants (e.g., the
frequency of softly is lower than the cumulative frequency of soft, softer, and softest).
These adverbs were placed at the end of sentences, which were read aloud four times
by six participants. For each participant, the duration of /t/ in the first production of a
word was ranked with respect to the duration of /t/ in the first production of the other
word in the pair. The second, third, and fourth productions were ranked similarly,
Table 5.2: Word pairs used by Hay (2003). The accompanying word frequencies
and cumulative frequencies of the inflectional variants are based on Celex.

71
Chapter 5
The role of morphology in acoustic reduction
and then average rankings were calculated for each word. Analysis of these average
rankings showed that /t/ was more reduced in words that are less decomposable.
There are, however, several reasons for interpreting these results with caution.
First, as shown in Table 5.2, this study is only based on five word pairs. Second,
the analyses are based on rankings of the durations rather than on the durations
themselves. Third, it is unclear why Hay’s decomposability measure does not take
into account the frequency with which the stem of the adverb occurs in derived words
(e.g., for soft, the frequency of softness was not taken into account).
Following Hay (2003), Schuppler et al. (2012) also investigated the correlation be-
tween decomposability and reduction. Their study analyzed the presence versus
absence of affixal /t/ in Dutch third person singular present tense verb forms (e.g.,
/Von+t/ woont ‘lives’). Their dataset consisted of 2110 verb forms extracted from the
Ernestus Corpus of Spontaneous Dutch. They quantified a word’s decomposability
as the ratio of its word frequency (e.g., woont ‘lives’) and the frequency with which
its stem occurs without affixal /t/, that is, the frequency of the first person singular
present tense (e.g., woon ‘live’). In contrast to Hay (2003), they found that /t/ was
more likely to be absent in words that are more decomposable.
In order to investigate whether this dataset would also show an effect if the quantifi-
cation of decomposability was more in line with Hay’s definition, we re-analyzed the
data. We quantified the decomposability of the third person singular present tense
as the frequency of this word divided by the cumulative frequency of all words in the
verbal paradigm (e.g., we investigated the effect of the frequency of woont relative
to the sum of frequencies of gewoond, wonen, wonend, wonende, woon, woonde,
woonden, and woont). Since it is unclear whether decomposability is only sensitive
to word forms containing exactly the same form of the stem, we calculated two mea-
sures of decomposability for irregular verbs: one based on only those verb forms
that contain exactly the same form of the stem (e.g., zoekt ‘searches’ versus zoek,
zoeken, zoekend, zoekende, and zoekt), and one based on all verb forms of the ver-
bal paradigm (e.g., zoekt ‘searches’ versus gezocht, gezochte, zocht, zoek, zoeken,
zoekend, zoekende, and zoekt). None of these relative frequencies significantly cor-
related with the presence versus absence of /t/. This raises the question whether
decomposition does play a role, as claimed by Schuppler et al. (2012).
We observed that the decomposability measure defined by Schuppler et al. (2012,
e.g., the frequency of zoekt relative to the frequency of zoek ) correlates (r = -0.19)
with the stem frequency of the verb form, that is with the sum of frequencies of the
verb forms containing exactly the same stem (e.g., the sum of frequencies of zoek,
zoeken, zoekend, zoekende, and zoekt). We examined which frequency measure
(their decomposability measure or stem frequency) better predicts the absence of /t/
by conducting a regression analysis with both measures as predictors. We orthogo-
nalized these measures by replacing stem frequency with the residuals of a regres-
sion model predicting stem frequency as a function of the decomposability measure.
The model predicting absence of /t/ showed significant effects of both measures.
72
Mental representation and processing of reduced words in casual speech
We then orthogonalized the measures by replacing the decomposability measure
with the residuals of a regression model that predicted this decomposability measure
as a function of stem frequency. Absence of /t/ correlated with stem frequency but
not with the residuals of the decomposability measure, which suggests that stem fre-
quency better predicts reduction of /t/ than the decomposability measure. The stem
frequency effect shows that /t/ is more likely to be absent at the end of words with
higher stem frequencies. An explanation may be that all words belonging to highly fre-
quent paradigms can be retrieved more easily and quickly, resulting in more reduced
pronunciations.
Another reason for why the effect reported by Schuppler et al. (2012) may in fact
not be driven by decomposability is that, of the 155 word types in their dataset, many
of the third person singular present tense verb forms are homophones of the cor-
responding first person singular forms (e.g., /Vet/ [Vet] weet ‘know’ versus /Vet+t/
[Vet] weet ‘knows’) or differed substantially from the first person singular form (e.g.,
/hEb/ [hEp] heb ‘have’ versus /heft/ [heft] heeft ‘has’). Schuppler et al. (2012) did
not differentiate between the different syntactic functions of a form, and considered
the frequency of each syntactic function to be the total frequency of the correspond-
ing form. For homophones, the decomposability measure therefore does not divide
just the frequency of the third person singular by the frequency of the first person
singular, but the total frequency of the form, that is, of the first, second, and third
person singular by exactly this same sum frequency. Hence, it cannot be compared
to the measure for non-homophone verb forms. For the irregular third person forms,
such as heeft, there is another problem with the decomposability measure: word-final
/t/ is completely predictable given the preceding part of the word and therefore does
not itself carry morphological information. If both the homophone and irregular items
are excluded from the dataset, the decomposability measure used by Schuppler et
al. (2012) is no longer significant. We conclude that whether the data analyzed by
Schuppler et al. (2012) show morphological effects remains open to discussion.
We also examined possible effects of decomposability on the basis of word-final
/t/ in Dutch past participles (Chapter 2 of this dissertation). We used the two de-
composability measures with which we re-analyzed the data provided by Schuppler
et al. (2012, see above). The presence versus absence and duration of /t/ were not
significantly affected by either of these relative frequencies.
Finally, Bürki, Ernestus, et al. (2011) studied the influences of a word’s morpholog-
ical decomposability on the reduction of French word-internal schwa (as in /K@+diK/
redire ‘to say again’). The authors extracted 4294 words with an internal schwa from
the ESTER corpus (Galliano et al., 2005), which contains radio-broadcast news. Their
measure for decomposability was different from the measures described above: five
native speakers of French were asked to assess each schwa on a five-point scale
from being clearly morpheme-internal (as in /S@mẼ/ chemin ‘way’) to being clearly
at a morpheme boundary (as in /K@+diK/ redire ‘to say again’). For each word, the
average value over assessors was used as a measure of the decomposability of the
73
Chapter 5
The role of morphology in acoustic reduction
word. Bürki, Ernestus, et al. (2011) observed that the presence versus absence and
duration of schwa did not correlate with this decomposability measure.
In conclusion, so far, only two studies have reported an effect of decomposability
and they did so by using different quantifications of decomposability. Since there are
no clear theoretical reasons to prefer one quantification over another and since the
effects observed may in fact not be morphological in nature, we conclude that so
far the literature does not provide any convincing evidence for the role of a word’s
morphological decomposability in reduction.
Word information load
Since we have, so far, found no convincing evidence that morphological structure
plays a role in the reduced pronunciation of morphologically complex words, this sec-
tion examines whether an important factor conditioning reduction in monomorphemic
words may also be relevant for complex words. Previous studies (e.g., Van Son &
Pols, 2003) have shown that a segment tends to be less reduced the more it con-
tributes to the identification of a word, and therefore to distinguishing the word from
other words. If morphological structure does not play a role, this word information
load hypothesis should also hold for segments in morphologically complex words:
the less a segment contributes to distinguishing the complete word from other words,
the more it may be reduced.
In the section on single segment affixes, we presented data that support this hy-
pothesis. We reported that word-final /t/ in Dutch past participles is more reduced
if it only represents a suffix (i.e., it is not both part of the stem and a suffix). This
would be unexpected if morphological structure played a role in reduction, since the
/t/ is the affix’s only segment, and reduction of /t/ would therefore lead to weaker
acoustic cues to morphological structure. In contrast, this finding is expected if word
information load is relevant: as most regular Dutch past participles end in suffixal /t/,
this segment is highly predictable and thus does not contribute much to distinguishing
the word from its competitors.
Pluymaekers, Ernestus, Baayen, & Booij (2010) investigated whether morphologi-
cal structure or word information load is a better predictor for reduction of the cluster
/xh/ in the Dutch word-final string /@xhEit/ -igheid. Dutch words ending in -igheid
either have the morphological structure stem+igheid (e.g., vast+igheid ‘security’) or
stem+heid, in which case the stem ends in -ig (e.g., zuinig+heid ‘thriftiness’). If mor-
phological structure plays a role in reduction, /xh/ is expected to be less reduced in
+heid words than in +igheid words, since in +heid words, the cluster /xh/ contains
a morphological boundary between the stem and -heid, whereas in +igheid words,
/xh/ is a cluster within the morpheme (Booij, 1995). If word information load plays
a more important role, the opposite reduction pattern is expected. In +igheid words
(like vastigheid), the cluster /xh/ eliminates inflectional variants (like vaste ‘solid’) and
compounds (like vasteland ‘main land’ and vastenavond ‘Mardi Gras’). In contrast,
74
Mental representation and processing of reduced words in casual speech
since stems ending in -ig (like zuinig) do not occur in compounds, +heid words based
on these stems solely compete with a few inflectional variants (like zuinige ‘thrifty’ and
zuinigste ‘most thrifty’). As a consequence, the cluster /xh/ has a much lower word
information load in stem+heid than in stem+igheid and is therefore hypothesized to
be more often reduced in +heid words. Pluymaekers et al. (2010) extracted 432 to-
kens ending in -igheid from the read speech component of the Spoken Dutch Corpus
and demonstrated that the duration of /xh/ was significantly shorter in +heid than in
+igheid words. This finding supports the word information load hypothesis.
A final study that we reviewed investigated the role of morphological structure and
word information load in the weakening of word-final /s/ in Spanish (Torreira & Ernes-
tus, 2012). The authors distinguished three types of /s/. First, /s/ can be part of a
stem as in martes ‘Tuesday’, in which case /s/ distinguishes the word from other
words (e.g., marte ‘Mars’). Second, /s/ can be a suffix that is redundant given the
context, like the plural suffix in años ‘years’ when preceded by cuatro ‘four’. In this
case, the suffix’s word information load is low. Third, /s/ can be a non-redundant
suffix carrying new information, as the plural suffix in quiero cosas ‘I want things’.
Torreira & Ernestus (2012) extracted 930 tokens of word-final /s/ from the Nijmegen
Corpus of Casual Spanish (Torreira & Ernestus, 2010a). Type of /s/ neither affected
the maximal difference in high-frequency intensity between the midpoint of /s/ and
the beginning of the following vowel nor the duration of the low-frequency intensity
dip in vowel-/s/-vowel sequences, but it significantly influenced voicing. Word-final
/s/ tended to be voiced less often if it was part of the stem (48% voicing) or a non-
redundant suffix (50%) compared to a redundant suffix (56%). This difference be-
tween redundant and non-redundant suffixes is best explained by word information
load. It is also in line with previous studies showing that context plays a role in reduc-
tion. For example, Bell et al. (2009) have shown that words tend to be more reduced
if they are more likely to occur given their context.
To summarize, one study directly addressed the question whether word informa-
tion load (i.e., a segment’s contribution to the identification of a word) or morphologi-
cal structure better predicts acoustic reduction, and provided evidence in favor of an
important role for word information load (Pluymaekers et al., 2010). The results of
two other studies also appear to be better explained by the word information load
hypothesis (Torreira & Ernestus, 2012; our new analyses discussed in the section on
single segment affixes). We therefore conclude that word information load is more
important in predicting degree of reduction than morphological structure.
General discussion
This paper provides an overview of studies from the literature and adds new analy-
ses on the role of morphological structure in acoustic reduction. In this section, we
discuss our findings and relate them to models of speech processing.
75
Chapter 5
The role of morphology in acoustic reduction
We first examined the role of morphological structure by investigating whether a
morpheme tends to be more reduced if it is repeated. Previous studies have shown
that complete words tend to be more reduced the more often they occur in the con-
versation (Fowler & Housum, 1987). The only study investigating whether this also
holds for morphemes in complex words is by Viebahn et al. (2012). This study did not
find a similar repetition effect for inflectional prefixes, unless the complete word was
repeated. This suggests that the pronunciation process does not analyze morphologi-
cally complex words into morphemes and consequently that morphological structure
does not play a major role in speech production.
This conclusion can also be drawn on the basis of the data discussed in the section
on single segment affixes. We examined whether segments forming single segment
affixes are less likely to be acoustically reduced than segments at the end of longer
morphemes, as segments forming single segment affixes are more important for the
identification of the word’s morphological structure. We carefully reviewed each study
that has investigated this hypothesis in either production experiments or on the basis
of speech corpora, including Losiewicz (1992), Schuppler et al. (2012), and our new
analyses of data reported in Chapter 2 of this dissertation. We concluded that none
of these provided clear evidence that a segment’s morphological status affects its
degree of reduction. In some studies, no effects of morphological status were found
at all, and in others the effects found may not be morphological in nature.
We then examined whether acoustic reduction was influenced by a word’s mor-
phological decomposability. Since words differ in how easily they may be decom-
posed into their morphemes, morphological structure may not affect the reduction of
all words to the same extent. For instance, single segment affixes may only be less
reduced than stem final segments if these affixes are part of highly decomposable
words. Several studies have investigated this hypothesis. They quantified a word’s
decomposability by comparing the frequency of the word with the frequencies of all
or some words that are morphologically related, or by asking native speakers to rate
the word’s decomposability. Two studies (Bürki, Ernestus, et al., 2011, and our new
analyses of the data reported in Chapter 2 of this dissertation) did not observe de-
composability effects. The other studies (Hay, 2003; Schuppler et al., 2012) reported
an effect of decomposability, but in both studies the effects observed are open to
alternative interpretations.
None of the four studies on morphological decomposability discussed in this paper
provided a clear argumentation for why they operationalized decomposability in the
way they did, and it is therefore difficult to choose between the measures. This is
important, as the two datasets that show a correlation between decomposability and
reduction (Hay, 2003; Schuppler et al., 2012) only do so if they quantify decomposa-
bility in different ways (i.e., decomposability was quantified as the word’s frequency
relative either to the frequency of all inflectional variants or to the frequency of the
stem). To determine the role of decomposability in acoustic reduction, we therefore
need a uniform definition of decomposability that is well-grounded in morphological
76
Mental representation and processing of reduced words in casual speech
theory and that can be easily quantified. Since this definition is currently not available
and the experimental and corpus-based studies conducted do not provide convincing
evidence for a role of decomposability in reduction, we conclude that, so far, the data
on acoustic reduction do not support the hypothesis that morphological decomposa-
bility affects speech production.
Finally, we examined whether a segment’s importance in identifying a word (i.e.,
its word information load) plays a more important role in acoustic reduction than a
segment’s importance for identifying a word’s morphological structure. The studies
that we found related to this issue (i.e., Pluymaekers et al., 2010; Torreira & Ernestus,
2012) support the word information load hypothesis. This again suggests that the
important units in speech production are words rather than morphemes.
Our review of the literature and our new analyses strongly suggest that morphemes
do not play a major role in speech production. This challenges traditional models of
morphological processing that assume that regular complex words are not stored in
the mental lexicon, but are computed from their morphemes on the basis of rules
(e.g., Chomsky & Halle, 1968; Pinker, 1991; Taft & Ardasinski, 2006). In addition, our
results challenge speech production models such as WEAVER++ (Levelt et al., 1999).
In this model, the word to be produced (lemma) is first selected from the mental
lexicon. If this word is morphologically complex, it is either treated as if it is monomor-
phemic (e.g., semantically opaque words), or it is processed via its morphemes (many
completely regular complex words). In this model, morphological structure is there-
fore important in speech production.
This lack of clear evidence for the role of a word’s decomposability in speech pro-
duction has implications for theories assuming that a speaker tailors a word’s degree
of reduction to the listener’s needs. Hay (2003) based her hypothesis that a word’s de-
composability affects its reduction on the dual-route models for word comprehension
(e.g, Schreuder & Baayen, 1995). These models assume that complex words can be
recognized via two routes: a decomposition route in which the word is decomposed
into its morphemes, and a direct route in which the entire word is directly retrieved
from the mental lexicon. Hay assumed that words are more likely to be processed via
the decomposition route the easier they are to decompose. Decomposition would be
facilitated if a word’s pronunciation contained clearer cues to its morphological struc-
ture. Hay hypothesized that speakers therefore mark morphological structure more
clearly in words that can best be recognized via the decomposition route, that is, in
words whose stem often occurs in inflectional variants. The absence of convincing
evidence for a role of a word’s decomposability in reduction means that there is no
clear evidence that speakers adapt their pronunciations of morphologically complex
words in order to facilitate the listener’s task.
The absence of data convincingly supporting a role of a word’s decomposability
in acoustic reduction also has consequences for the Hyper- and Hypospeech theory
(Lindblom, 1990). This theory assumes that speakers prefer to hypo-articulate, unless
this is harmful for the listener. The lack of clear evidence that speakers fine-tune the
77
Chapter 5
The role of morphology in acoustic reduction
degree of reduction to their listener’s needs strongly suggests that this theory does not
hold for how speakers produce every individual segment in a word. This conclusion
is in line with the finding by Bard et al. (2000), that speakers reduce repeated words
independently of whether the current listener has heard the previous token.
We conclude that the words of the language are stored as complete units in the
mental lexicon and are accessed directly. How easily the production of a segment
is planned depends on several factors, including its predictability given the preceding
part of the word and the preceding wider context (i.e., its information load). If this pro-
cess of planning only takes a little time, the speaker can produce the segment more
quickly, which may result in more reduced pronunciations (Bell et al., 2009). This
view supports analogical models of speech production (e.g., Bybee, 2001; Skousen,
1989), in which morphological structures are not highly relevant for speech produc-
tion. The connections between related words reveal the morphological structure,
which the speaker can use in the formation of new morphologically complex words.
Importantly, our overview not only demonstrates that there is currently no evidence
that morphological structure plays a substantial role in acoustic reduction, it also
makes clear that several studies which present support for a role of morphological
structure seem to do so because the effect that they report is not only correlated with
morphological structure but also with, for instance, word information load. This again
shows that researchers should carefully consider conflicting explanations for the pat-
terns in their data before concluding that one of them plays a role. Moreover, this
shows that progress in research can only be made if researchers make their datasets
available to other researchers. In this paper, we only re-analyzed datasets on which
we had worked ourselves, as these were the only ones available to us.
In sum, the studies conducted so far show no convincing evidence for a role of
morphological structure in acoustic reduction. Future studies first have to provide a
better definition of morphological decomposability before we further investigate the
role of morphological structure in speech processing. Moreover, they have to avoid
confounds of morphological structure and word information load. Should these future
studies not provide clear evidence for a role of morphological structure, this will have
serious implications for the existing psycholinguistic models of speech production.

Individual differences in the choice and
pronunciation of words
Chapter 6
This chapter is a reformatted version of:
Iris Hanique, Mirjam Ernestus, and Lou Boves (submitted). Choice and pronunciation of words:
Individual differences within a homogeneous group of speakers.
Abstract
This paper investigates whether individual speakers forming a homogeneous group
differ in their choice and pronunciation of words when engaged in casual conversa-
tion, and if so, how they differ. More specifically, it examines whether the Balanced
Winnow classifier is able to distinguish between the twenty speakers of the Ernes-
tus Corpus of Spontaneous Dutch, who all have the same social background. To
examine differences in choice and pronunciation of words, instead of characteris-
tics of the speech signal itself, classification was based on lexical and pronunciation
features extracted from hand-made orthographic and automatically generated broad
phonetic transcriptions. The lexical features consisted of words and two-word combi-
nations. The pronunciation features represented pronunciation variations at the word
and phone level that are typical for casual speech. The best classifier achieved a
performance of 79.9% and was based on the lexical features and on the pronunci-
ation features representing single phones and triphones. The speakers must thus
differ from each other in these features. Inspection of the relevant features indicated
that, among other things, the words relevant for classification generally do not contain
much semantic content, and that speakers differ not only from each other in the use
of these words but also in their pronunciation.

Individual differences in the choice and pronunciation of words
Introduction
Language users have a multitude of different words at their disposal, and individu-
als may differ in their choice of words. For instance, some people may prefer the
word start to the word begin or may use big instead of large. In speech, an addi-
tional type of variation is the exact pronunciation of words. Many words produced in
casual speech show a range of possible pronunciations from the full pronunciation
variant to highly reduced ones, in which phones are replaced by others or are com-
pletely missing. For instance, probably may be pronounced as [prAb@bli], [prAbli],
[prAli], and [prA]. Deviations in one phone from the full form occur in over 60% of the
word tokens in casual American English, and two or more phones deviate in 28% of
the tokens (Johnson, 2004). Similar numbers have been found for other languages
(Ernestus & Warner, 2011). In this paper, we focus on a socially homogeneous group
of speakers and investigate whether these speakers differ in their choice and pro-
nunciation of words in casual conversations, and if so, how they differ. Research on
individual differences in conversational speech will improve our understanding of the
speech production process, and help us improve psycholinguistic models of speech
processing.
Previous research on individual differences in word choice has focused on written
text and function words (e.g., Ebrahimpour et al., 2013; Koppel, Schler, & Argamon,
2009; Stamatatos, 2009). Content words, such as table and sleeping, and word com-
binations, such as old tree, are very context dependent. In contrast, function words,
such as that and but, are not likely to vary greatly with the topic of the text and
can consequently more easily reveal topic independent individual differences in word
choice. In the present study, we investigate the roles of both function words and con-
tent words, henceforth unigrams, and also of combinations of two words, henceforth
bigrams.
Differences in acoustic reduction have been shown between groups of speakers.
Several studies have reported effects of gender; for example, in Dutch, men tend
to reduce words ending in the suffix /l@k/ -lijk more often than women (e.g., in
/mox@l@k/ mogelijk ‘possible’; Keune et al., 2005), and, in American English, they
more often delete word-final /d/ and /t/ (Guy, 1980) and glides (Phillips, 1994). Fur-
ther, younger speakers tend to reduce more than older speakers. This has been
demonstrated, for instance, for the absence of word-final /d/ and /t/ in American
English (Guy, 1980) and for the absence of segments in spontaneous Dutch (Strik et
al., 2008). Finally, speakers of Dutch in Flanders tend to reduce less than speakers
of Dutch in the Netherlands (Keune et al., 2005).
There is also some evidence that individual speakers may differ from each other in
their reduction of words, even if they are members of the same social group. Ernes-
tus (2000, p. 143) studied a group of twenty speakers who were all highly educated
men aged between 21 and 55, and who were all born and raised in the western
part of the Netherlands. She observed differences in the pronunciation of the Dutch
80
Mental representation and processing of reduced words in casual speech
word /natyrl@k/ natuurlijk ‘of course’. Whereas most speakers only produced the ex-
tremely reduced variant [tyk] in the middle of Intonational Phrases, one speaker also
pronounced [tyk] in the initial and final positions of the Intonational Phrase and even
in isolation. This raises the question whether differences between individual speak-
ers can also be observed for other reduction phenomena that are typical for casual
conversations.
To study differences in the choice and reduction of words between individual speak-
ers, we applied a classification algorithm, in which speech fragments are attributed
to their speakers on the basis of lexical and pronunciation patterns. If classification
results in high performance scores, this would indicate that speakers differ in their
speech habits. To examine how speakers differ, we inspected which words and pro-
nunciation variants were important for distinguishing a speaker from others.
Our study is based on human-made orthographic and automatically generated
broad phonetic transcriptions. These show the words that were used and how these
words were pronounced at the phone level. By using broad phonetic transcriptions,
we ignore all detailed information in the spectro-temporal representation of the speech.
We do so because this spectro-temporal representation not only contains linguistically
relevant information about how words were exactly articulated, but also paralinguistic
information including voice quality, and these two types of information cannot easily
be separated.
We are not the first to apply speaker classification to phonetic transcriptions. Van
Bael & Van Halteren (2007) studied the effects of the speaker’s age, gender, regional
background, and level of education on word choice and pronunciation variation by
classifying speakers belonging to groups differing in these characteristics. Using au-
tomatically generated broad phonetic transcriptions of the telephone dialogues of the
Spoken Dutch Corpus (Oostdijk, 2002), the authors generated two sets of classifi-
cation features: one set of approximately 150000 lexical features, including average
utterance length, part-of-speech tags, and uni-, bi-, and trigram counts, and another
set of 94 pronunciation features representing phone differences between full pronun-
ciations of words and their actual phonetic transcriptions. The classification algorithm
that they used was able to classify speakers according to their age, gender, and re-
gional background on the basis of lexical features. Interestingly, classification was
hardly effective on the basis of the pronunciation features. The authors suggested
that this may be due to the broadness of the phonetic transcriptions, the limited set of
pronunciation features, or the heterogeneity within their speaker groups.
In this paper, we study Dutch speakers who have the same regional background,
gender, and educational level; that is, a homogeneous set of speakers. We investi-
gate whether these speakers show individual differences in their choice and pronun-
ciation of words in casual conversations, and if so, how these speakers differ.

Individual differences in the choice and pronunciation of words
Method
Speech data
For our study, we used the Ernestus Corpus of Spontaneous Dutch (ECSD; Ernes-
tus, 2000), which consists of 15 hours of casual dialogues produced by ten pairs of
speakers. These twenty speakers together uttered 155294 word tokens representing
9044 word types. On average, each speaker produced 7765 word tokens (ranging
from 5419 to 10936 tokens). The speakers form a very homogeneous group: they
are all males who hold academic degrees. Further, they are all native speakers of
standard Dutch born and raised in the western part of the Netherlands. The main
characteristic in which these speakers vary is their age, which ranges from 21 to 55
years.
Schuppler et al. (2011) generated broad phonetic transcriptions for the ECSD using
an automatic speech recognition (ASR) system based on the Hidden Markov Model
Toolkit (Young et al., 2002). An ASR system uses speech fragments and orthographic
transcriptions of these fragments as input. In addition, it requires a pronunciation
lexicon containing the full form and possible pronunciation variants for each word
in the corpus (e.g., for the Dutch word gewoon ‘just’ the lexicon contained the full
form /x@won/ and the variants /xwon/ and /xon/). These pronunciation variants
were created with 32 rules that had been formulated on the basis of earlier observa-
tions of pronunciation variation and that insert, alter, or delete phones. Finally, the
ASR system uses 37 monophone acoustic models consisting of three states with 32
Gaussians per state (Hämäläinen et al., 2009). On the basis of these phone models,
which had been trained on the read speech component of the Spoken Dutch Corpus,
the ASR system determined for each word in the orthographic transcriptions which
variant from the pronunciation lexicon best matched the speech signal.
Schuppler et al. (2011) validated this transcription procedure by comparing its out-
put for the IFA corpus (Van Son, Binnenpoorte, Van den Heuvel, & Pols, 2001) with
manual transcriptions of this corpus. They calculated how often phones in the au-
tomatic transcriptions deviated from those in the manual transcriptions in terms of
insertions, replacements, and deletions. They observed an overall agreement of
86.0%, which is similar to agreements among human transcribers reported in the
literature (e.g., Kipp et al., 1997, reported agreements between human-made tran-
scriptions of spontaneous German of 78.8%, 79.9%, and 82.6%; for more information
on agreements typically obtained for phonetic transcriptions see Ernestus & Baayen,
2011). Chapter 2 validated the automatically generated transcriptions of the ECSD
with human-made transcriptions on the basis of 148 schwas in the initial syllables of
past participles (as in /x@mIst/ gemist ‘missed’). Two human transcribers agreed on
the presence versus absence of schwa in 82.4% of the tokens, while they agreed
with the ASR system in 75.7% and 77.0% of the tokens. These agreements did not
differ significantly from each other. Given these evaluations, and since obtaining bet-
82
Mental representation and processing of reduced words in casual speech
ter transcriptions for such a large corpus is difficult, we accepted these automatic
transcriptions as being valid.
As automatic phonetic transcriptions can only be created for uninterrupted speech
(i.e., without, for instance, overlapping speech or laughter), the number of transcribed
words is lower than the number of words in the entire corpus. Our transcriptions
contain 95173 word tokens and 6965 word types, ranging from 1 to 3459 word tokens
per word type. The most frequent word types were ik ‘I’ and dat ‘that’ with 3459
and 3402 tokens respectively. On average, for each speaker 4759 word tokens were
transcribed, representing 944 word types.
For our classification tests (see below), we used the automatically generated pho-
netic transcriptions and the corresponding orthographic transcriptions. Moreover, we
divided the transcriptions of each speaker into ten equally sized fragments. The size
of these fragments was different for each speaker: it varied between 375 and 742
word tokens, and had an average of 479 tokens.
Classification Features
Classification algorithms distinguish between classes (in our case speakers) on the
basis of features which represent properties of these classes (e.g., single words such
as window or the absence of a phone such as /t/). We represented each of the
200 fragments in our dataset (10 fragments per speaker) as a list of features that are
based on the fragment’s orthographic and phonetic transcription.
To investigate word choice, we extracted all unigrams and bigrams from the tran-
scriptions. If a word was not preceded or followed by another word, a bigram was
created including a silence before or after the word. We then selected those uni-
grams and bigrams that occurred more than twenty times in the entire corpus and
that were produced by at least two speakers. This resulted in 403 unigrams, each of
which on average occurred 195 times in the entire corpus (range: 21 to 3459) and
in 61 fragments (range: 12 to 200). The total number of bigrams was 642, each of
which on average occurred 75 times in the corpus (range: 21 to 1931) and in 44
fragments (range: 12 to 199). Following Van der Sijs (2002), we considered prepo-
sitions, conjunctions, determiners, pronouns, and numerals as function words, and
nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and interjections as content words. The selected
unigrams consisted of 158 function word types and 245 content word types.
To study individual differences in the pronunciation of words, we included pronun-
ciation features. Since we focused on how speakers reduce words in casual speech,
we ignored three well-known types of variation in Dutch pronunciation, because these
occur as often in read speech as in casual speech. First, we ignored the variation
in the pronunciation of Dutch word-final -en, which is mostly pronounced as [@] and
sometimes as [@n] except in the east of the Netherlands. Second, we also ignored the
insertion of phones, for example, the pronunciation of /mElk/ melk ‘milk’ as [mEl@k],
as this is not reduction.
83
Chapter 6
Individual differences in the choice and pronunciation of words
Third, we ignored the variation in the pronunciation of obstruents as voiced or voice-
less (e.g., /v/ versus /f/). The voicing of obstruents is highly variable in Dutch,
especially as spoken in the western part of the Netherlands. Like most speakers
from this area, our speakers often replaced voiced fricatives by their voiceless coun-
terparts (Schuppler et al., 2011) and frequently applied regressive and progressive
voice assimilation (Ernestus, Lahey, Verhees, & Baayen, 2006) Moreover, the auto-
matic transcriptions that were used in our study have been generated by means of
acoustic models that may not reliably encode voicing for obstruents, since they had
been trained with speech for which the voicing of obstruents may not have been re-
liably transcribed. We therefore collapsed the members of the obstruent pairs /z,s/,
/v,f/, /d,t/, /g,k/, /b,p/, /Z,S/, and /G,x/.
We examined pronunciation variation at the phone level, henceforth phone fea-
tures, and at the word level, henceforth word pronunciation features. Our phone
features provided information whether a phone was produced as it would be if the
word had been produced in careful speech. For each phone in a word token, we
determined whether it was unreduced, i.e., produced as in the full pronunciation of
the word, was replaced by another phone, or was completely absent. For example,
the Dutch word /hel@mal/ helemaal ‘completely’ may be pronounced as [h@lmal], in
which we considered all consonants and the final vowel as being unreduced, the first
vowel as being replaced by schwa, and the second vowel as being absent.
For each phone, we defined four types of possible features. One type was the
phone itself without any neighboring phone, henceforth uniphones; for example, /e/
replaced by schwa. Two possible feature types included either the preceding or fol-
lowing phone from the full form, henceforth biphones; for example, /e/ replaced by
schwa and followed by /l/. The final possible feature type represented the phone
and both neighboring phones from the full form, henceforth triphones; for example,
/e/ replaced by schwa in the sequence /hel/. If the phone was positioned at a word
boundary, we took the neighboring phone from the neighboring word, for example, in
[h@lmalni] helemaal niet, the phone following the final [l] of helemaal was /n/.
Each possible feature was only used if it met the following two criteria. First, it
had to occur more than twenty times in the entire corpus. Second, there had to be
at least one other pronunciation of that phone (sequence) that occurs at least twice
in the entire corpus; for example, the feature replacement of /e/ by schwa followed
by /l/ was only used if another variant, that is a present or absent /e/ followed by
/l/, occurred at least twice. In total, we used 955411 phone features that represent
2394 phone feature types. Table 6.1 presents the numbers of the phone features
split to uniphones, biphones, and triphones, and whether the phone was unreduced,
replaced, or absent. On average, a phone feature occurred 399 times (ranging from
21 to 41799 times) and in 87 fragments (ranging from 4 to 200 fragments).
Word pronunciation features represent pronunciation variation at the word level.
For instance, the word mensen ‘people’ can be produced in the unreduced form
[mEns@] or in a reduced variant, such as [mEns] or [mEs]. We selected as word

pronunciation features, word pronunciations that occurred more than twenty times in
the entire corpus and produced by at least two speakers. In addition, the words they
represented had to have at least one other pronunciation variant that occurred at least
twice in the entire corpus. This is to ensure that the features could indeed capture
pronunciation variation and not just lexical information, which would certainly be the
case if there is only one pronunciation variant. Note that if the other pronunciation
variant does not meet the selection criteria, this other variant is not used as a feature.
In total, 290 word pronunciation variants met these restrictions, and these variants
represent 157 word types (52 word types had one pronunciation variant; 86 word
types had two variants; eleven word types had three variants; seven word types had
four variants; and one word type had five variants). These variants represented 128
unreduced forms, for example [mEns@] mensen ‘people’, and 162 reduced variants,
for example [mEs], a variant of mensen ‘people’.
Classification algorithm
We used the Balanced Winnow classifier (Dagan, Karov, & Roth, 1997; Littlestone,
1988) implemented in the Linguistic Classification System (LCS; Koster, Seutter, &
Beney, 2003; Koster & Beney, 2009). This algorithm assigns two weights (w+ and
w−) to each feature for every speaker, and the overall (Winnow) weight is their differ-
ence. Features of a certain speaker with a positive overall weight are used to classify
a fragment as belonging to that speaker, whereas those with a negative overall weight
are used for classification as not belonging to that speaker. The value of an overall
weight indicates how useful the feature is to distinguish the speaker from all other
speakers in the corpus. The output for each speaker from the LCS is a model, hence-
forth speaker profile, which consists of two lists, one with positive overall weights and
one with negative overall weights. We used them to identify the speaker of a new
fragment and thus to test how well the classifier performed. In addition, we used the
profiles to characterize the differences among speakers: in a certain speaker pro-
file, features with a positive overall weight are assumed to be characteristic for that
85
Chapter 6
Individual differences in the choice and pronunciation of words
speaker, whereas those with a negative overall weight are assumed to be uncharac-
teristic for that speaker.
The classifier created speaker profiles in the training phase in which it receives all
(training) fragments as input, labeled as a positive or negative example for a given
speaker. A fragment produced by a certain speaker is a positive example for only
that speaker and is a negative example for all other speakers. The classifier first
constructs initial speaker profiles on the basis of all fragments. Each initial profile
consists of a list of all features with their initial weights, calculated through the LTC
algoritm (Salton & Buckley, 1988). Subsequently, these speaker profiles are adapted
during multiple training iterations, in each of which all (training) fragments are again
presented to the classifier. For each fragment, the classifier calculates the correspon-
dences between that fragment and every speaker based on the fragment’s features
and the weights for these features in each of the speaker profiles. Balanced Winnow
is a mistake-driven classifier, which means that weights in a speaker profile are only
updated if a fragment is classified incorrectly during training. If a fragment belonging
to a speaker scores for that speaker above threshold θ+, the fragment is correctly
classified as a positive example and the weights remain unchanged. In contrast,
if it scores below this threshold, the classification is treated as a mistake and the
weights in the speaker profile are updated by multiplying the positive weights of the
active features, i.e. those that occur in both the fragment and the speaker profile,
with parameter α and the negative weights of the active features with parameter β.
In addition, if a fragment that does not belong to a given speaker has a score for that
speaker below another threshold, θ−, it is correctly classified as a negative example,
whereas if this fragment scores above the threshold, the weights of the active features
in that speaker’s profile are updated by multiplying positive weights with β and nega-
tive weights with α. After testing values for the parameters around the default settings
of LCS, we used those settings that resulted in the highest performance, namely α =
1.05, β = 0.98, θ+ = 0.8, θ− = -0.8, and a maximum of 20 training iterations.
Classification tests
To test how well the classifier performed, we used ten-fold-cross-validation: the clas-
sifier was trained on 180 fragments (nine from each speaker) and tested with the
remaining 20 fragments (one from each speaker). This procedure of training and
testing was repeated ten times, so that each fragment was used as a test fragment
exactly once. Each fragment used in this study belonged to only one speaker, and
therefore our tests are mono-classifications.
The order in which the training module of the classifier processes the fragments
cannot be controlled and is entirely random. As a consequence, running the classi-
fier twice does not usually lead to exactly the same results. We therefore ran each
ten-fold-cross-validation 100 times. From the 100 performances of each classification
test, we determined the lowest, highest, and average performance. The difference
86
Mental representation and processing of reduced words in casual speech
between the lowest and highest performance was on average 7.24% (range: 5.5%
to 9.5%). Average performances are reported in the Results. To compare the per-
formance of different classification tests, we performed several unpaired t-tests on
obtained performance scores (see below). As we performed multiple t-tests, we ap-
plied Bonferroni correction and used an alpha level of 0.0045.
To obtain information about which features contribute to the identification of speak-
ers and thus in what aspects of choice and pronunciation of words speakers differ
from each other, we manually inspected speaker profiles. For this manual inspection,
we trained the classifier with the best performing combination of features (see be-
low). Furthermore, we used all 200 fragments for training and thus obtained speaker
profiles that are based on as much data as possible. As these speaker profiles are
created by running the classifier only once, running it again will probably result in
slightly different speaker profiles. To use only those features that are robust, i.e.,
likely to be part of the speaker profiles if we run the classifier again, we examined
only those features that have an overall Winnow weight that is larger than the me-
dian weight, which was calculated separately for positive and negative weights. The
positive overall weights ranged from 0.00025 to 2.54 with a median of 0.08, and the
negative overall weights varied between -0.005 and -6.43 with a median of -0.15.
We focused on the features that are characteristic for only a few speakers and thus
provide information about differences between speakers. We therefore determined
which features have a positive overall weight larger than the positive median for only
one to four speakers and a negative weight larger than the negative median for 15 or
more speakers.
Results and discussion
As it is only meaningful to investigate differences between speakers with a well-
performing classifier, we first investigated how well our best classifier performs in gen-
eral. We therefore examined how often it correctly classified a fragment. Moreover,
we investigated whether speakers in the same conversation were often confused with
each other, which may be due to the topic of the conversation or to interactive speech
alignment (Pickering & Garrod, 2004). Thereafter, we investigated the relevance of
the different types of features by comparing classifiers trained and tested with various
combinations of feature sets. Furthermore, for each feature type, we examined which
features are especially relevant for characterizing individual speakers. As a perfor-
mance measure for these classifiers, we used the harmonic means of their precision
and recall (F1), presented in Table 6.2.
General performance
The best performing classifier made use of both lexical features and of the uniphone
and triphone features. The average performance of this classifier is as high as

79.86%, which may be surprising given the homogeneity of the group of speakers. As
shown in the confusion matrix (Table 6.3), the percentage of correct classifications for
individual speakers ranged from 43.7% to 100%. Some speakers (e.g., Speakers J,
N, and O) were seldom confused with other speakers. In contrast, a substantial num-
ber of fragments were incorrectly attributed to Speakers G and T, as were fragments
of Speakers E and I to other speakers. Apparently, some speakers were more difficult
88
Mental representation and processing of reduced words in casual speech
to classify than others. Note that the classifier was still able to correctly classify the
more difficult speakers well above chance level (i.e., 5%), suggesting that they were
not indistinctive in their word choice or pronunciations.
We examined whether speakers who participated in the same conversation were
more often confused with each other than with other speakers. Speakers in the same
conversation discuss the same topics, which inevitably results in the use of the same
content words. Moreover, several studies have shown that speakers tend also to align
their speech on other levels, including syntactic and phonological levels (interactive
speech alignment, e.g., Pickering & Garrod, 2004). As a consequence, speakers
in the same conversation may be more confused with each other than with other
speakers. This was only the case for six out of the twenty speakers. As shown
by the underlined numbers in Table 6.3, Speakers A, E, I, K, Q, and U were more
often classified as the other speaker in the conversation than as speakers from other
conversations. Interestingly, the partners for Speakers A, I, K, and U (i.e., Speakers
B, S, L, and V respectively) were not more often classified as the other speaker in
the conversation, which suggests that these speakers also display more idiosyncratic
properties.
Only the speakers of the pair E-Q were often confused with each other. Twenty-
one percent of these two speakers’ top 50 positive features concern a content word,
which is either eens ‘once’, is ‘is’, ja ‘yes’, kunnen ‘can’, maken ‘make’, natuurlijk ‘of
course’, nu ‘now’, vind ‘find’, weet ‘know’, or wil ‘want’. These content words are not
very informative about what the speakers talked about. It is therefore unlikely that
confusion between Speakers E and Q is the result of the topic of the conversation. It
probably results from alignment at various linguistic levels or coincidental similarities
between these speakers.
Lexical features
In order to investigate differences in speakers’ choice of words, we first trained and
tested the classifier on the basis of lexical features only, namely uni- and bigrams.
These tests are presented in the first three rows of Table 6.2. T-tests showed that
including both unigrams and bigrams resulted in a significantly better performance
than using only unigrams (t(198.0) = -104.4, p < 0.0001) or bigrams (t(197.5) = -69.6,
p < 0.0001). The performance with both unigrams and bigrams was approximately
74% (row 3), indicating that speakers greatly differ in their choice of words.
Table 6.4 shows features that are characteristic for only a few speakers. The ma-
jority of the characteristic bigrams contain a silence (e.g., ∅ dus ‘∅ so’), indicating
that speakers differ especially in which words they produce directly before or after
a pause. Furthermore, the majority of the features are function words (e.g., want
‘because’ and we ‘we’) and those that are content words are highly frequent and
semantically relatively weak (e.g., goed ‘good’ and nee ‘no’).
To further investigate the contribution of content and function words to the classifi-

Mental representation and processing of reduced words in casual speech

cation performance, we also trained and tested the classifier on unigrams only in-
cluding either of these word types. Based on function words only, we obtained a
performance of 26.0%, whereas classification based on content words only resulted
in a performance of 39.5%. Both results were significantly lower than the classifica-
tion performance of 51.7% based on all unigrams (function words: t(198.0) = 121.2,
p < 0.0001; content words: t(196.8) = 59.6, p < 0.0001), suggesting that neither of
the word types can solely account for the performance based on all unigrams. In-
terestingly, classification based on content words performed significantly better than
the classification based on function words (t(197.2) = 66.0, p < 0.0001). Importantly,
the number of features cannot explain this difference in classification performance,
since the number of content word features (27381) was lower than the number of
function word features (51377). These results suggest that speakers differ from each
other especially in their use of semantically weak content words, such as discourse
markers.
Phone features
We refrained from testing models with pronunciation features only, as these would
mainly signal lexical variation instead of pronunciation variation. For instance, when
using this type of classifier, if we found that the word pronunciation variant /tyk/
for natuurlijk ‘of course’ is characteristic for a few speakers, this would probably be
because these speakers more often produced this word and not because they pro-
nounced it differently from the other speakers. All our classifiers therefore included
lexical features.
We first combined the lexical features with phone features. The best performance
was obtained with the classification including the uniphone and triphone features
(compare row 10 of Table 6.2 to rows 4 to 9 and 11 to 14). This set of features
improved performance by approximately 6% compared to the classification that was
based on lexical features only (row 3 vs. 10: t(197.9) = -28.4, p < 0.0001).

Chapter 6
Individual differences in the choice and pronunciation of words
As classification including biphones resulted in lower performances than classifica-
tion including triphones, information about either neighboring segment is apparently
less helpful than information about both neighboring phones. The probable explana-
tion is that the exact pronunciation of a phone depends on both the preceding and
following phone (e.g., /@/ may especially be absent after /x/ and before a sonorant);
both neighboring phones are therefore necessary for variation to be meaningful.
Table 6.5 presents the phone features that are characteristic for only a few speak-
ers. There are two reasons for not being able to directly conclude that these differ-
ences among speakers reflect individual differences in reduction. First, if only one
variant is incorporated as a phone feature, speaker differences in the use of these
phone features cannot represent individual differences in pronunciation; they show
that speakers differ in how often they produce words with these phones. Second, if
speakers differ in the words in which these phones occur, differences among these
speakers may reflect differences in word choice rather than in phone realization. Re-
search has shown that a segment is more likely to be reduced in one word than in
another depending on the word’s frequency of occurrence, the preceding or follow-
ing segment, and whether the segment carries stress (e.g., Bell et al., 2009; Cho &
McQueen, 2005; Mitterer & Ernestus, 2006).
Two-thirds of the features in Table 6.5 represent unreduced phones with their neigh-
boring phones. For 51.1% of these unreduced characteristic features (which is 35.4%
of all features in Table 6.5), counterparts with an absent or replaced phone do not
occur frequently enough in the corpus to be included in the phone features. For in-
stance, the unreduced feature /tyr/ was characteristic for Speaker I, who produced
it in the words /natyrl@k/ natuurlijk ‘of course’, /pros@dyr@(s)/ procedure(s) ‘proce-
dure(s)’, /lit@rAtyr/ literatuur ‘literature’, /dyr/ duur ‘expensive’, /dyr@/ dure ‘expen-
sive’, /dyrt/ duurt ‘lasts’, and /dyrd@/ duurde ‘lasted’ (remember that voiced and

voiceless obstruents have been collapsed in the pronunciation features). Its counter-
part in which /y/ is absent occurs only twice in the entire corpus (both occurrences
concern an inflection of /kYltyrel/ cultureel ‘cultural’ produced by Speaker K) and the
replacement of this segment occurs only once (in the pronunciation [natYr] /natyr/
natuur ‘nature’ produced by Speaker H). Since this phone sequence is only repre-
sented with its full pronunciations in the feature sets, its relevance cannot be attributed
to pronunciation variation but probably results from variation in word choice.
In contrast, the remaining 48.9% of the unreduced characteristic features appear
to represent pronunciation variation. For example, an unreduced schwa in the se-
quence /x@t/ is characteristic for Speakers P and T, who produced it mainly in /x@dan/
gedaan ‘done’, /zEx@/ zeggen ‘say’ followed by /t/ or /d/, /tex@/ tegen ‘against’ fol-
lowed by /t/ or /d/, and /x@delt@/ gedeelte ‘part’. In contrast, the absence of this
schwa is characteristic for Speakers K, L, P, R, and V. These speakers produced the
sequence /x@t/ mainly in the words /x@dan/ gedaan ‘done’, /zEx@/ zeggen ‘say’ fol-
lowed by /t/ or /d/, and /x@tAl/ getal ‘number’. As the sequence /x@t/ occurs in
approximately the same words for the two speaker groups, the difference in pronun-
ciation between these two groups is not likely the result of differences in word choice
but in genuine pronunciation variation.
A second example represents the unreduced pronunciation of the sequence /Al@/,
which is characteristic for Speaker V only. He produced this sequence in the words
/Al@/ alle ‘all’, /Al@s/ alles ‘everything’, /Al@rlEI/ allerlei ‘all kinds of’, /Al@mal/ alle-
maal ‘all’, /antAl@/ aantallen ‘numbers’, and /x@vAl/ geval ‘case’ followed by a schwa.
The counterpart in which /l/ was absent was characteristic for six other speakers,
namely Speakers E, H, M, P, R, and T. These speakers produced this counterpart
in the word /Al@mal/ allemaal ‘all’ only. Speaker V therefore differs from these other
speakers in how he pronounces the sequence /Al@/ in the semantically weak word
allemaal.
The other third of all phone features in Table 6.5 represent absent and replaced
phones in approximately the same numbers. All but one (i.e., sen → s@n) of these
features have unreduced counterparts in the feature set and are therefore likely to
represent genuine pronunciation variation. The absence of schwa in /j@t/ is an ex-
ample of a feature that clearly represents pronunciation variation. It is characteristic
for Speaker H and uncharacteristic for sixteen other speakers. Sixteen of this fea-
ture’s occurrences (84.2%) represent the word /j@/ je ‘you’ followed by a /t/ or /d/,
while the remaining occurrences represent the word types /spœytj@/ spuitje ‘little sy-
ringe’, /festj@/ feestje ‘little party’, and /betj@/ beetje ‘a little’ followed by /t/ or /d/.
The unreduced pronunciation of /j@t/ was characteristic for five different speakers
(i.e., Speakers E, F, K, L, and Q) and uncharacteristic for ten speakers (i.e., B, H, I,
M, N, O, R, S, T, and U). These five speakers produced this sequence also mainly
in the word /j@/ je ‘you’ followed by a /t/ or /d/ (83.9%). This indicates that the
absence of schwa in /j@t/ represents pronunciation variation, primarily in the seman-
tically weak word je, and is not likely to result from lexical choice. Our data thus show
93
Chapter 6
Individual differences in the choice and pronunciation of words
that our socially homogeneous group of speakers are not at all homogeneous in their
pronunciation of the phone sequence /j@t/.
Since some phone features appear to represent occurrence of phone sequences
rather than pronunciation variation, the question arises whether genuine pronunci-
ation variation really contributes to speaker identification. In order to answer this
question, we ran an additional classifier based only on lexical features and the full
pronunciations of the phone features. For instance, the uniphone feature absence of
/x/ was converted to unreduced /x/ and replacement of /a/ by /@/ was replaced
by unreduced /a/. All unreduced features remained unchanged. This classifier thus
contained no features representing pronunciation variation. Consequently, if the best
performing classifier so far uses information about pronunciation variation, the clas-
sifier without pronunciation variation should perform worse. The performance of the
classifier without pronunciation variation was 70.0% (not incorporated in Table 6.2),
which is significantly less than the classification based on lexical features and uni-
phone and triphone features (row 10 of Table 6.2; t(198.0) = -48.1, p < 0.0001).
Interestingly, this performance is also worse than the performance of the classifier
based on lexical features only (row 3; t(197.9) = -19.0, p < 0.0001). We conclude
that pronunciation variation contributes to classification, and speakers thus differ in
how they pronounce phones and phone sequences.
Interestingly, the classifier achieved better performance if it was not only based
on lexical and triphone features but also on uniphone features (Table 6.2 row 7 vs.
10: t(197.9) = -3.4, p < 0.001). This suggests that variation in the single phones,
regardless of the context, also reflects speaker-specific behavior. Most of the re-
levant uniphones represent reductions (see Table 6.5). For instance, the absence
of /x/ is characteristic for Speaker V. This speaker did not produce /x/ 33 times
out of 422 times, and this was mainly in the semantically weak words /nOx/ nog
‘yet’ and /tOx/ toch ‘still’ (also in /x@xan/ gegaan ‘went’, /EIx@l@k/ eigenlijk ‘actually’,
/Onx@ver/ ongeveer ‘approximately’). As only one of the characteristic uniphones is
an unreduced pronunciation, we conclude that speakers hardly differ in how often
they produce most single phones. In contrast, they differ in how they reduce single
phones.
Comparison of the relevant features that regard vowels and consonants (Table 6.5)
showed that for both unreduced and absent uniphones and triphones, the numbers
are approximately the same (i.e., unreduced: 24 vowels and 21 consonants; absent:
6 vowels and 5 consonants). This is unsurprising for the uniphones, given the simi-
larity in the numbers of vowels and consonants among the unreduced and absent
uniphones provided to the classifier (i.e., unreduced: 16 vowels and 15 consonants;
absent: 14 vowels and 13 consonants). In contrast, the numbers of vowels and con-
sonants differ among triphones in the input (i.e., unreduced: 450 vowels and 379
consonants; absent: 202 vowels and 149 consonants). The fact that approximately
the same number of triphones with vowels and consonants characterize speakers
94
Mental representation and processing of reduced words in casual speech
therefore suggests that, for both the unreduced and absent segments, a larger pro-
portion of the consonants than vowels is speakers specific.
Furthermore, the replaced phones that distinguish speakers from each other are all
vowels. This is in line with the number of replaced vowel and consonant features in the
input of the classifier: 22 uniphone and 47 triphone replacements concerned a vowel,
but only 1 uniphone and 7 triphone replacements concerned a consonant which all
concerned the pronunciation of [m] instead of /b/ or /p/. A likely explanation is
that vowels are easily reduced to schwa, while consonants are not often replaced
by another consonant (aside from the consonant that has the same characteristics
except for voicing; e.g., /v/ is often replaced by /f/). As explained in the Method,
variation in voicing is not specific for casual speech and was therefore ignored.
In conclusion, the classification including phone features showed that speakers
differ in their pronunciations of single phones and of sequences of three phones. In-
terestingly, we found that several triphone features mainly originate from semantically
weak words, which shows that speakers differ in the pronunciations of these words.
Word pronunciation features
Finally, we ran a classifier that used all types of features, that is, lexical features,
phone features, and word pronunciation features. To avoid words being represented
by both lexical and word pronunciation features, words that could be represented by
both were only included as word pronunciation features. For instance, in the clas-
sification tests without word pronunciation features, the word mensen ‘people’ was
represented as unigram, in five bigrams (i.e., mensen die ‘people who’, die mensen
‘those people’, de mensen ‘the people’, mensen ∅ ‘people ∅’, and ∅ mensen ‘∅ peo-
ple’), and in the phone features. As [mEns@], [mEs@], [mEns], and [mEs] were part of
the word pronunciation features, when including these, we replaced each occurrence
of mensen that was produced as one of these variants by its actual pronunciation. If
an occurrence of mensen was pronounced differently from the pronunciations that are
part of the word pronunciation features (e.g., as [mEns@n] or [mEsn]), the occurrence
was not replaced. For bigram features, this means that none of the words, both of the
words, or either of the words could be replaced. This procedure gave a preference
to the word pronunciation features over the lexical features and thus gave the word
pronunciation features every chance to distinguish between speakers.
The best performance including word pronunciation features was achieved with the
combination of all lexical features, phone features, and word pronunciation features
(78.9%; final row of Table 6.2). Importantly, this performance is significantly worse
than the best performance with lexical and phone features only (row 10; t(196.9) =
4.9, p < 0.001). Hence, the addition of word pronunciation features does not result in
an improvement. One explanation may be that speakers do not differ in their pronun-
ciations for complete words. This is however unlikely as classification based on lexical
and word pronunciation features only (i.e., without any phone features) resulted in an
95
Chapter 6
Individual differences in the choice and pronunciation of words
improved performance compared to classification with only lexical features (row 15
vs. row 3 of Table 6.2; t(186.5) = -10.3, p < 0.0001). An alternative and more prob-
able explanation is that the variation in the pronunciation of entire words is already
captured by the phone features. This is supported by the triphone features discussed
in the previous section which upon closer inspection appeared to represent a small
number of words (e.g., reduced /j@t/ mainly represented the word je ‘you’ followed by
/t/ or /d/ and unreduced /Al@/ represented mainly the word allemaal ‘all’). Moreover,
all words are also represented by uniphone and triphone sequences. For example,
the pronunciation [mEs] for /mEns@/ mensen ‘people’ is presented as a word pro-
nunciation variant, but is also represented in the uniphones /m/, /E/, absence of
/n/, /s/, and absence of /@/, and in the triphones /?mE/ (in which ? indicates any
possible preceding segment), /mEn/, absence of /n/ in /Ens/, /ns@/, and absence
of /@/ in /s@?/ if these features met the restrictions described in the Method. The
phone features outperformed the word pronunciation features probably because they
additionally capture variation that spans word boundaries (e.g., resulting from cross-
word assimilation), and they therefore contain more information about the speaker’s
pronunciation habits than word pronunciation features.
General discussion
This paper investigated whether individual speakers sampled from a socially homo-
geneous group differ in their choice and pronunciation of words when engaged in
casual conversations, and if so how. We studied the homogeneous group of twenty
male speakers of the ECSD and tested whether a classification algorithm was able
to distinguish between these speakers. In order to focus on the speakers’ choice
and pronunciation of words rather than characteristics of the speech signal (includ-
ing voice characteristics), we trained and tested the classifier on the basis of features
extracted from hand-made orthographic and from automatically generated broad pho-
netic transcriptions. We hypothesized that if the classifier was able to distinguish be-
tween these speakers, they have to differ in their choice and pronunciation of words.
To study how speakers differ from each other, we inspected which features in the
speaker profiles created by the classifier were relevant for classification.
Our classification tests based on only lexical features resulted in a high perfor-
mance (73.9%), indicating that the speakers differed in the words they used. Two
types of words appeared to be relevant in distinguishing between speakers. The first
are function words (e.g., want ‘because’ and dat ‘that’), which is as expected as they
are often regarded as useful features in research on authorship attribution (e.g., Kop-
pel et al., 2009; Stamatatos, 2009). The second type are highly frequent content
words that are semantically relatively weak (e.g., goed ‘good’ and no ‘nee’). In au-
thorship attribution, content words are often argued to be topic dependent and thus
less suitable for distinguishing between writers. Our results suggest that including se-
96
Mental representation and processing of reduced words in casual speech
mantically weak content words may provide more information than including function
words only and may thus be beneficial.
Classification tests including features that represent pronunciation variation typi-
cal for casual speech performed better than tests based on lexical features alone.
However, inspection of the relevant pronunciation features showed that some of them
probably represent lexical information rather than pronunciation variation. Others rep-
resent pronunciation variation and, importantly, they are the ones responsible for the
increase in classifier performance.
These pronunciation features show that speakers differ in how often they reduce
certain phones and phone sequences. Closer inspection of the speaker specific tri-
phone features showed that some of them mainly originate from a few semantically
weak words, including allemaal ‘all’ and the pronoun je ‘you’. This suggests that
speakers differ in how they realize phones not only given the immediate phone con-
text but also given the carrier word. Moreover, it shows that semantically weak words
contribute to speaker classification at two levels: speakers differ in their use and pro-
nunciation of these words.
Interestingly, the performance of classification with uniphones and triphones was
higher than that of classifications including biphones. Apparently, the pronunciation
of single phones by themselves or with two neighboring segments is more informative
than the pronunciation of these phones given only one neighboring segment. A likely
explanation is that generally a phone’s pronunciation does not only depend on one
of the neighboring phones but on both neighbors. Moreover, as mentioned above,
speakers differ from each other in how much they reduce certain semantically weak
words and a given word is better identified by a triphone than by a biphone.
Another type of pronunciation feature that did not increase classification perfor-
mance is formed by the word pronunciations. In the classification including pronun-
ciation features at the word level, we replaced lexical features that were also repre-
sented as word pronunciation features by their actual pronunciation. By doing so, we
favored the word pronunciation features. Nevertheless, all classifications including
word pronunciation features performed worse than the classification with lexical fea-
tures and uniphone and triphone features. Probably, the triphone features contained
all information present in the word pronunciation features, in addition to pronunciation
variation spanning word boundaries.
Previous research has shown that speakers participating in the same conversation
tend to align their speech at for instance lexical, syntactic, and phonological levels
(e.g., Pickering & Garrod, 2004). We expected that this alignment would demonstrate
itself in that speakers within a conversation would be more often confused with each
other than with other speakers in general. This expectation was borne out for only
30% of the speakers. This low number indicates that the properties of the speech
produced by a given speaker at a given moment is colored more by idiosyncratic
speech habits than by processes of speech alignment with the conversation partner.
97
Chapter 6
Individual differences in the choice and pronunciation of words
Van Bael & Van Halteren (2007) investigated classification of groups of speak-
ers on the basis of phonetic transcriptions and reported that classification based on
pronunciation features performed poorly. The authors discussed several possible ex-
planations for this finding. Our results indicate which of their explanations is most
likely. First, the authors noted that their pronunciation feature set may have been too
small as it contained only 94 pronunciation features. This is a likely explanation since
we used many more pronunciation features and our classification improved when we
added any type of pronunciation features to the lexical features (see Table 6.2). A
second explanation provided by Van Bael & Van Halteren (2007) concerns the he-
terogeneity within their classes. They classified speakers in terms of social groups
defined by, for instance, regional background and age. As a consequence, one class
contained multiple speakers who may have had different pronunciation habits. Our
findings suggest that this is also a highly probable explanation, as our classifier was
able to distinguish between speakers within the same social group.
Van Bael & Van Halteren (2007) also suggested that their phonetic transcriptions
may not have been sufficiently detailed to capture pronunciation differences among
speakers. Since the transcriptions that we used were also broad phonetic transcrip-
tions without any fine-phonetic detail, our results suggest that this is an unlikely ex-
planation. However, we agree with these authors that individual differences may be
larger if also fine-phonetic detail is taken into account. Whereas our study only inves-
tigated whether speakers differ in which segments they realize or substitute by other
segments (i.e., categorical reduction), previous research has shown that reduction
may also be gradient in nature (e.g., Browman & Goldstein, 1990; Davidson, 2006;
Torreira & Ernestus, 2010b, Chapter 2): only a part of a segment may be reduced
or segments may not be reduced sufficiently to be identified as different phones. Fu-
ture studies focusing on both categorical and gradient reduction may report larger
individual differences.
Currently, psycholinguistic models explain how the average speaker produces his
speech. Our finding that individual speakers differ in their choice and pronunciation
of words needs to be incorporated in these models. For instance, in a production
model like WEAVER++ (Levelt et al., 1999), speakers should differ in the resting acti-
vation levels of words and perhaps even of pronunciation variants. Exemplar-based
production models, such as the one described by Goldinger (1998), should assume
that speakers differ in their number of exemplars for some words and pronunciation
variants. Furthermore, speech comprehension models may assume that a listener
adapts to the specific pronunciations of the speaker he is listening to.
In conclusion, the speakers that we investigated belonged to a homogeneous group,
and may therefore be expected to show similar speech habits. Nevertheless, our clas-
sification tests showed that these speakers differ in the words they use, as well as in
how they pronounce the words in casual conversations. Individual differences be-
tween speakers’ pronunciations can be observed, even if these speakers have the
same social background.

General discussion and conclusions
Chapter 7
The aim of this dissertation was to improve our understanding of the way language
users produce and recognize acoustically reduced words in casual speech. It pre-
sented a series of studies on reduction processes typical for natural Dutch conversa-
tions. In this chapter, we discuss what these empirical chapters have taught us about
how to investigate the production and comprehension of reduced speech. Moreover,
we examine the results of these studies and discuss the implications for psycholin-
guistic models of speech production and comprehension.
Methodology
While conducting our studies, we encountered three main types of methodological
challenges. The first of these concerns the analysis of corpus data and experimen-
tal data. Our analyses were difficult, as variation in the data could be explained by
many different predictors, which were not necessarily those we were interested in.
For instance, in Chapter 4, we had no special interest in the effects of word dura-
tion, although it is known to be an important predictor for response times. If we had
excluded word duration from our analyses, any variation it could have captured may
then have been captured by other variables, including the predictors of interest. As a
consequence, any effects of the predictors of interest might then have (partly) been
caused by word duration. We therefore had to include a large number of predictors.
However, the inclusion of many predictors can lead to overfitting, which has to be
prevented. The second challenge is the method that we used in Chapter 6, namely
classifying speakers on the basis of their choice and pronunciation of words. As
this method has not often been used to study individual differences in pronunciation
variation, we had to develop a new approach to adapt this method for our research
question. The third challenge concerns the fact that this dissertation focuses on re-
duction processes in casual speech, while speakers usually do not produce this type
of speech when placed in front of a microphone in a laboratory setting.
Analyses
In Chapters 2, 3, and 4, we statistically analyzed our corpus data or experimental data
using mixed effects regression models. We first fitted a model with all fixed effects,
99
Chapter 7
General discussion and conclusions
namely predictors of interest and control predictors, and eliminated non-significant
effects (backward elimination). Subsequently, we tested for interactions between the
remaining fixed effects and predictors of interest (forward selection). Furthermore, we
tested the included fixed effects as random slopes, as recommended by Barr, Levy,
Scheepers, & Tily (2013), and kept those random slopes that were significant. In
our studies, this procedure led to the inclusion of many fixed effects and interactions;
some of these had very small effect sizes, some were uninterpretable higher-order
interactions, and others were not replicable and probably resulted from overfitting.
To improve the reliability of our results, we adopted more conservative statistical ap-
proaches with respect to the inclusion of fixed effects. Which conservative approach
was used depended on the aim of the analyses.
In Chapters 2 and 3, the aim was to find out which variables predict the degree of
reduction of a segment and to compare the predictors that influence the shortening of
a segment with those that influence its absence. In order to base this comparison on
reliable predictors, we included only those predictors that were statistically significant
and improved the quality of the model. The model’s relative quality was determined by
means of the Akaike Information Criterion (Akaike, 1973), which takes the goodness
of fit of the model and the complexity of the predictors into account. This procedure
led to a manageable number of interpretable predictors.
In Chapter 4, we set out to examine how robust priming effects are that provide
evidence in favor of the storage of exemplars. In these analyses, only a few predictors
were of specific interest. One predictor allowed us to investigate generalizability over
the two speakers who recorded the stimuli. Two other predictors indicated whether
primes and targets were similar in their degree of reduction, and whether they were
produced by the same speaker. We tested for main effects of these predictors of
interest as well as several control predictors, but restricted our analyses to interactions
between the predictors of interest. In this way, we obtained clear and interpretable
results.
In Chapter 5, we reviewed several studies that have argued that segments im-
portant for a word’s morphological structure tend to be less reduced. This review
showed that not only the selection of the best statistical model has to be conducted
with care, but also the interpretation of this model. We questioned the interpretations
of data patterns revealed in several of the studies. For instance, some studies based
their conclusions on the comparison of two small sets of words that not only differed
in morphological structure but also in other properties, such as frequency of occur-
rence. These differences in other properties instead of difference in morphological
structure may be responsible for the difference in pronunciation observed between
these two sets of words. Furthermore, several researchers investigated the ease
with which a morphologically complex word can be decomposed, and used different
quantifications of this decomposability, which resulted in opposite findings. Since the
researchers did not provide theoretical justifications for their quantification methods,
these findings are difficult to interpret.

Mental representation and processing of reduced words in casual speech
This dissertation thus demonstrates that many statistical approaches can be used
to analyze the same speech data and that these do not necessarily lead to the same
results. There is currently no standard statistical approach and this dissertation can
be viewed as a contribution to the development of such a standard. Furthermore, it
demonstrates that some results can be explained by multiple hypotheses, and that
these hypotheses should all be carefully considered before strong conclusions are
drawn.
Classification
Chapter 6 presented the results of a study on individual differences in the choice
and pronunciation of words. We classified speakers using lexical and pronunciation
features. Examples of lexical features are the single word allemaal ‘all’ and the word
combination ze zeggen ‘they say’, whereas examples of pronunciation features are
the pronunciation of /EIk/ for the word /EIx@l@k/ eigenlijk ‘actually’ and the absence
of the segment /x/. The classifier provided insights into which features are relevant
for the identification of the speaker of a speech fragment. We inspected the relevant
features, however, as running the classifier twice resulted in slightly different results
and thus slightly different relevant features, not all features identified as relevant by
a given classifier were reliable. We therefore used the weights assigned to these
features which indicate how relevant a feature is relative to the other features, and
inspected only those features with a weight higher than the median weight.
The original aim of Chapter 6 was to focus on differences in pronunciation only.
However, we had to consider differences in word choice as well because some pro-
nunciation features appeared to reflect lexical differences rather than pronunciation
differences. For instance, the sequence /tyr/ did not occur in the feature set as a
reduced sequence, in which /y/ is absent or replaced, but only occurred as an unre-
duced sequence. The speaker for whom this unreduced feature was characteristic
therefore differed from other speakers in the frequency with which he produced the
sequence, regardless of the pronunciation. To determine whether speakers really
differed in degree of reduction, our classifiers were also based on lexical features,
representing differences in word choice. As a consequence, the pronunciation fea-
tures are more likely to really capture pronunciation variation. Moreover, we exam-
ined every relevant pronunciation feature as to whether it really reflected differences
in pronunciation, by determining by hand whether the speakers not only differed in
the pronunciation of the relevant phonemes, but also in the words containing these
phonemes.
Casual versus laboratory speech
In a substantial part of this dissertation, we focused on the question of whether re-
duced pronunciation variants have their own lexical representations. This has previ-
ously been examined by means of psycholinguistic experiments investigating whether
101
Chapter 7
General discussion and conclusions
the frequencies of these variants influence speech processing (e.g., Bürki et al., 2010;
Ranbom & Connine, 2007; Pitt et al., 2011). These researchers argue that if these
frequencies influence speech processing, they have to be stored, together with the
variants they belong to. Unfortunately, the role of variant frequency in speech pro-
cessing can only be studied well in words presented in isolation, but many reductions
only occur in words in the middle of sentences.
In Chapter 2, we therefore used a different method to investigate whether reduced
pronunciation variants have their own lexical representations. We based our inves-
tigations on recordings of spontaneous conversations between speakers who knew
each other well. As these conversations took place in an informal setting in which the
speakers were able to talk freely, the speech of these recordings mirrors everyday ca-
sual speech. We focused on two reduction processes in Dutch that affect many word
types and only occur in casual, connected speech, namely reduction of schwa and
/t/. Following Bürki, Ernestus, et al. (2011) and Torreira & Ernestus (2011), for each
of these segments we compared the sets of predictors that influence the shortening
and absence of the segment. If a segment’s absence is influenced by the same set of
predictors as its shortening, its absence is likely to be the extreme result of its short-
ening. In contrast, if the sets of predictors differ, the segment’s absence is not likely
to be the result of extreme shortening; rather, it results from a process that makes
the segment categorically absent, such as the retrieval of a pronunciation variant in
which this segment is completely missing. As the data were extracted from spon-
taneous conversations, the segments investigated differed from each other in many
aspects, which could all influence their shortening and absence but which could not
all easily be established and tested (e.g., prosodic position, speech rate, frequency of
the carrier word, and surrounding segments). This raises the question of whether it is
possible at all to find the same sets of predictors in this type of data and thus whether
our research method is valid. Torreira & Ernestus (2010b) also studied highly ca-
sual speech and found that complete and partial devoicing of vowels in spontaneous
French are influenced by the same sets of predictors. Moreover, in our own data, we
found that the absence and shortening of /t/ are influenced by the same sets of pre-
dictors. Finally, Chapter 3 showed that finding the same sets of predictors is possible
on the basis of less variable data. This demonstrates that if differences in the sets of
predictors are found (as we did for schwa in Chapter 2), this cannot be ascribed to
chance, but that it is meaningful.
The segments studied in Chapter 2 differed from each other in many aspects, in-
cluding those that could not easily be determined, such as prosodic position. We
therefore tried to replicate our results on the basis of speech in which the segments
studied only differed in easily determinable aspects, whereas other aspects were kept
the same. We constructed sentences in which these segments, for instance, differed
in the preceding segment but occurred in the same prosodic position. One speaker
recorded these sentences twice: once in a formal speech style and once in a ca-
sual speech style, including many reductions. In a shadowing experiment, we then
102
Mental representation and processing of reduced words in casual speech
asked participants to repeat these sentences as quickly as possible. We hoped that
this procedure would result in casual realizations of the sentences. Unfortunately, it
did not. The speech elicited did not contain any extremely reduced forms that are
typical of casual speech, such as /EIk/ for /EIx@l@k/ eigenlijk ‘actually’ or /Am/ for
/Al@mal/ allemaal ‘all’. Moreover, the number of absent schwas in the participants’
responses was relatively small regardless of the degree of reduction of the sentence
they heard, indicating that participants did not repeat the pronunciation variants they
heard, but aimed at producing full forms. These results suggest that the shadowing
task is inappropriate for eliciting casual speech.
During the preparation of the experiments described in Chapter 4, we also experi-
enced how difficult it is to elicit a certain type of speech. We asked two speakers to
record words in a reduced and an unreduced way. As one of these speakers normally
produces speech with a larger degree of reduction than the other speaker, we in-
formed the speakers of the type of stimuli we wanted to obtain, hoping that this would
result in similar reduced stimuli as well as similar unreduced stimuli. The speaker
who normally produces highly reduced speech made an effort to clearly and slowly
pronounce the unreduced stimuli, and the speaker whose speech is typically not very
reduced made an effort to produce the reduced stimuli by pronouncing them quickly
and sloppily. Unfortunately, the degree of reduction of the reduced and unreduced
stimuli was still larger for the speaker who tends to reduce more.
In sum, corpus studies allow us to investigate speech phenomena as they occur in
natural conversations, but the data differ from each other in many aspects, making it
more difficult to investigate why one speech unit differs from another. Moreover, cor-
pus data cannot easily provide information about the time course of the production
process and the predictors that influence this time course. This is, however, relevant
for our understanding of the speech production process. The data from experimental
studies tend to vary in fewer aspects and may provide information about the time-
course of speech processing. However, as the shadowing task used in Chapter 3
was unable to elicit casual speech, still more research is required in order to find an
experimental paradigm that allows us to study the production of this type of speech.
Currently, research needs to use both corpus and experimental studies complemen-
tarily, which ideally will provide converging evidence.
Experimental results
Mental representations
Chapters 2 and 3 reported on the processes underlying the absence of a segment. A
segment’s absence can result from extreme gradient shortening of the segment dur-
ing articulation. Alternatively, it may result from a categorical process, for instance,
the retrieval of a stored pronunciation variant in which segments are completely (ca-
tegorically) absent. In both chapters, we investigated whether the absence of schwa
103
Chapter 7
General discussion and conclusions
and /t/ in Dutch are gradient or categorical by comparing the predictors that influence
a segment’s shortening and absence.
In Chapter 2, we examined natural casual conversations, and in Chapter 3, we
studied speech elicited by a shadowing task. As the speech studied in Chapter 3
appeared to be less casual than the speech studied in Chapter 2; we in fact, studied
both segments in two types of speech. The results for /t/ indicate that the shortening
and absence of this segment are influenced by the same set of predictors in both
types of speech. This was also found for schwa but only in the less casual speech
elicited by the shadowing task. The relevant predictors are phonetic in nature; for
example, schwa tended to be shorter and more often absent if the preceding seg-
ment was longer, and /t/ tended to be shorter and more often absent if the preceding
segment was a fricative rather than another preceding segment. Both examples sug-
gest that schwa and /t/ may be co-articulated with their preceding segment. The
absence of these segments therefore appears to be the extreme result of segment
shortening, and thus of a gradient process. This result is in line with earlier pa-
pers reporting gradient reduction processes underlying absence of English /t/ and
schwa (Browman & Goldstein, 1990, 1992), absence of schwa in English consonant-
schwa-consonant sequences (Davidson, 2006), absence of French schwa (Bürki et
al., 2010), and French vowel devoicing (Torreira & Ernestus, 2010b).
The sets of predictors for the absence and for the shortening of schwa in ca-
sual conversations showed similarities as well as clear differences (Chapter 2). Both
schwa’s absence and shortening were influenced by, for instance, speech rate and
the syllable that the schwa belonged to. These predictors suggest that, at high speech
rates, schwa can be co-articulated with its surrounding consonants, and its absence
can thus result from extreme gradient shortening. Predictors that influenced either
schwa’s absence or shortening include word length and duration of the preceding
consonant, which influenced schwa’s absence but not its shortening, and the place
of articulation of the surrounding consonants, which only influenced schwa’s shorten-
ing. These results strongly suggest that the absence of schwa may also result from a
categorical process. Earlier support for categorical reduction is based on processes
that only affect highly frequent word combinations (e.g., /e/ in French /setE/ c’était
‘it was’; Torreira & Ernestus, 2011) or affect words both in casual and formal speech
or both in context and in isolation (e.g., French word-internal schwa; Bürki, Ernestus,
et al., 2011). Our results contribute to these findings by showing that reduction pro-
cesses may be categorical, if they affect many word types and only occur in casual,
connected speech.
Further, our finding that the absence of schwa may result from a categorical pro-
cess in casual speech, whereas it typically results from extreme shortening in less
casual speech, raises questions about the production processes underlying different
speech styles. If other reduction processes that are categorical in casual, connected
speech are gradient in less casual speech, the production processes underlying dif-
ferent speech styles may be qualitatively different: the role that lexical representations
104
Mental representation and processing of reduced words in casual speech
for reduced pronunciation variants play during speech production then depends on
the speech style.
In Chapter 4, we focused on the role of exemplars in the comprehension of reduced
speech. A role for exemplars is supported by earlier studies reporting priming effects
if primes and targets were acoustically identical, whereas these effects were smaller
or even absent if primes and targets differed in, for instance, the speaker or the real-
ization of a certain segment (e.g., Bradlow et al., 1999; McLennan et al., 2003). We
investigated how robust these exemplar effects are by focusing on reduction and ex-
amining whether they also arise in conditions more similar to natural conversations.
Most reduced stimuli used in this study contained acoustic traces of all their segments
and thus represented gradient reduction. As these pronunciation variants cannot be
stored in abstract representations, any priming effects would therefore provide evi-
dence for exemplars.
Only one of the four priming experiments showed exemplar effects. This was the
simplest experiment in which participants were presented with one type of varia-
tion (i.e., degree of reduction), participants only heard one speaker, the lag between
primes and targets was small, and a large proportion of the words were primed, which
probably made the repetition of words clear to the participants. This experiment was
most similar to earlier priming experiments showing exemplar effects. The other three
experiments tested exemplar effects under conditions more similar to those of natu-
ral conversations and did not show any exemplar effects. In Experiments 2 and 4,
a smaller proportion of words were primed and the lag between primes and targets
was longer; in Experiments 3 and 4, participants were presented with differences in
both degree of reduction and speaker voice (participants heard two speakers). Over-
all, in Chapter 4, we suggest that in casual conversations, exemplars do not play a
large role in speech comprehension. Perhaps exemplars are only relevant in situa-
tions where a stimulus that created an exemplar is likely to be repeated, and where
accessing exemplars may be helpful for word recognition.
Furthermore, exemplars are possibly not stored in the mental lexicon but only in
episodic memory. Whereas the mental lexicon represents procedural knowledge
stored in the neocortex, episodic memory is stored in the hippocampus and contains
detailed, contextual knowledge about past events; for instance, it not only contains
the acoustic details of a given utterance but also knowledge about when and where
the event happened, and who else was present. These episodic memories are not
very stable and disappear after a short period of time (often estimated at several
hours up to four or five days; e.g., Vertes, 2004). The fact that episodic memory is
not very stable can explain our findings that priming effects are not very robust. More
research is needed to investigate this further.

General discussion and conclusions
Morphology
In Chapter 5, we reviewed several papers that suggested that the degree of reduction
of a word is influenced by its morphological structure, and we re-analyzed some of
the data. Moreover, we contrasted this morphological structure hypothesis with the
word information load hypothesis that states that reduction is influenced by a seg-
ment’s relevance for the identification of the entire word, regardless of its morpholog-
ical structure. For instance, we examined studies on whether a segment tends to be
less reduced if it forms a morpheme on its own than if it is part of a longer morpheme.
The data on these single segment affixes as well as the other data reviewed provided
no clear evidence for a substantial role for morphological structure, but demonstrated
that word information load is more important in the production of reduced words. We
concluded that, so far, there is no convincing evidence that morphological structure
influences acoustic reduction.
This conclusion is in line with data from Chapter 2 on the reduction of schwa in
the prefixes ge-, be-, and ver- of Dutch past participles. Although schwa is equally
relevant in these prefixes for the identification of the prefix and therefore for the iden-
tification of the word’s morphological structure, it tended to be more reduced in the
prefix ge- than in the prefixes be- and ver-. This difference can be explained by the
prefixes’ relevance for the identification of the complete word: whereas the prefix ge-
only indicates the word’s syntactic function, namely that it is a past participle, the
prefixes be- and ver- contain semantic information that is crucial for identifying the
meaning of the entire word. For example, the stem taal can be combined with both
prefixes be- and ver-, but the meanings of the two resulting verbs are completely
unrelated: the past participle betaald means ‘paid’ and the past participle vertaald
means ‘translated’.
Future research should further determine whether there is any role for morpho-
logical structure in the processing of casual speech. One line of research may be
based on the study by Cohen-Goldberg (2013), who reported that during the produc-
tion process the phones of a word compete with each other, and that this competition
is smaller across morpheme boundaries. His study was based on words read aloud
in isolation and the question arises whether such effects can also be found for words
produced in more natural conditions, such as casual, connected speech.
Individual differences
In Chapter 6, we reported on whether individual speakers differ in their choice and
degree of reduction of words. Our study focused on a homogeneous group of speak-
ers with the same social background. Earlier studies (e.g., Guy, 1980; Keune et al.,
2005) have shown that social groups of speakers, for instance based on gender or
educational level, differ in the way they pronounce words. Speakers within a social
group should therefore display similar speech patterns. Nevertheless, we found clear
differences between individual speakers that belong to the same social group.
106
Mental representation and processing of reduced words in casual speech
These speakers differed in the words they used (i.e., lexical choice) and in how they
pronounced these words. Differences in lexical choice concerned function words,
such as om ‘to’ and ze ‘they’, and semantically weak content words, such as nee ‘no’
and goed ‘good’. In the literature on authorship attribution (see Koppel et al., 2009;
Stamatatos, 2009), content words are often regarded as being topic dependent and
therefore as being less useful for the identification of the author of a text. However,
we suggest that the usage of certain content words, namely semantically weak ones,
may also be beneficial for research on authorship attribution.
Differences in the speakers’ pronunciations were found for single phones (e.g., re-
duction of /x/) and for phones given both the preceding and following phone (e.g.,
the pronunciation of /l/ in the sequence /Al@/). The pronunciation differences that we
found were often only represented by a few words, mostly semantically weak ones.
For instance, differences in the reduction of /x/ were mainly based on /nOx/ nog
‘yet’ and /tOx/ toch ‘still’ and variation in the sequence /Al@/ mainly resulted from
variation in the word /Al@mal/ allemaal ‘all’. Speakers did not differ in their pronunci-
ation of phones given either the preceding or following phone. Because combinations
of two phones occur in many more different word types than combinations of three
phones, taken together our results suggest that these speakers did not differ so much
in their pronunciations of certain phone sequences, but mainly in their pronunciations
of certain semantically weak words.
The study described in Chapter 6 demonstrates that clear differences can be ob-
served in the words that speakers use and the way they pronounce these words, even
if these speakers are members of the same social group. To deal with this quite sub-
stantial variation, listeners probably adapt to this variation similarly to the way they
adapt to speakers with a (foreign) accent (e.g., Dahan et al., 2008; Witteman, 2013).
Furthermore, our study demonstrates that differences in degree of reduction can be
used for the identification of the speaker of a certain speech fragment, which may
be useful in the field of forensic science. More research is needed to establish the
usefulness of individual differences in reduction for forensic science.
Psycholinguistic models
The results of our studies provided us with information about speech processes and
lexical representations and can be used to improve psycholinguistic models of speech
production and comprehension. These models vary mostly in their assumptions about
the number of pronunciation variants that are stored and whether the lexical repre-
sentations contain acoustic detail. They range on a continuum from abstractionist
models storing only a word’s full pronunciation without acoustic details (e.g., Chom-
sky & Halle, 1968; Levelt et al., 1999; Pinker, 1991) to exemplar models storing many
acoustically detailed (combinations of) tokens for each word (e.g., Bybee, 2001; Gol-
dinger, 1998). In the middle, the continuum contains abstractionist models storing
multiple pronunciation representations per word (e.g., Ranbom & Connine, 2007) and
107
Chapter 7
General discussion and conclusions
hybrid models storing both abstract representations and exemplars (e.g., Goldinger,
2007; Hawkins, 2003; McLennan et al., 2003; Pierrehumbert, 2002).
In Chapter 2, we provided evidence that schwa may be absent categorically in
many different words produced in casual, connected Dutch. This result supports mo-
dels that, for a large number of words, do not store just one but multiple pronunciation
variants per word. These lexical representations may be strings of phonemes or be
acoustically detailed.
In Chapter 4, we have shown that the role of exemplars may be smaller in the
comprehension of casual, connected speech than previously assumed. This study
thus provides only little support for models that assign an important role to exemplars
in speech processing. Above, we argued that acoustic traces of words are perhaps
not part of the mental lexicon, but are stored in episodic memory.
As the results of Chapters 2 and 4 indicate that the mental lexicon stores multiple
pronunciation variants for each word, but not in the form of exemplars, the question
arises regarding the exact nature of these representations. Purely abstract represen-
tations cannot account for gradual changes over time of the pronunciation of some
words (Port, 2007), nor can they easily account for the role of the fine acoustic details
in speech comprehension (Johnson, 2004). Perhaps the representations do not con-
sist of purely abstract strings of speech units, such as phonemes, but contain some
acoustic details that are not token-specific, as in exemplar-based models, but that are
generalizations over many tokens. For our understanding of speech processing, it
is important that future research investigates the exact nature of mental representa-
tions and memory systems that are involved in the storage of multiple pronunciation
variants.
Results presented in Chapter 5 showed that there is currently no convincing evi-
dence for a substantial role of morphological structure in speech production. This sug-
gests that morphologically complex words are not computed from their morphemes
during speech production, but are retrieved as single units. Complex words are thus
stored in the mental lexicon. As the lexicon also contains several pronunciation vari-
ants for each word (e.g., Chapter 2; Bürki et al., 2010; Bürki, Ernestus, et al., 2011;
Ranbom & Connine, 2007; Pitt et al., 2011; Torreira & Ernestus, 2011), the storage of
complex words implies that the lexicon contains many more words and pronunciation
variants than previously assumed (e.g., Chomsky & Halle, 1968; Levelt et al., 1999;
Pinker, 1991; Schreuder & Baayen, 1995; Taft & Ardasinski, 2006). This presents
a challenge for production and comprehension models, as they have to explain how
speakers and listeners select the correct word and pronunciation variant.
Our finding that morphological structure does not play a substantial role in speech
production raises the question of how speakers create new morphologically complex
words and how these words are understood by listeners. One possibility is that the
words that share form and meaning (i.e., morphologically related words) form net-
works in the mental lexicon (Bybee, 2001). New words may be created and under-
stood on the basis of these networks.
108
Mental representation and processing of reduced words in casual speech
Finally, in Chapter 6, we demonstrated that individual speakers differ in the words
they produce and how they pronounce these words. To incorporate these results,
psycholinguistic models need to adopt the assumption that the mental lexicon may
not be equal for all speakers. Models including abstract representations may assume
that speakers differ in the resting activation levels of each of the stored pronuncia-
tion variants. If future research shows a clear role for exemplars, which would be
unexpected given the findings described in Chapter 4, models storing exemplars may
assume that speakers differ in the number of exemplars they have stored for some
words and pronunciation variants.
Conclusions
In this dissertation, we focused on reduction processes that are typical for casual,
conversational Dutch. We addressed the difficulties of studying how speakers pro-
duce and how listeners understand this type of speech and showed the importance
of conducting corpus studies and experimental research complementarily. The re-
sults of our studies provide important information about how speakers and listeners
process speech in general, more specifically about the nature and the role of lexical
representations. Research on casual speech is therefore not only beneficial for gain-
ing a better understanding of how speakers and listeners process casual speech, but
it is also beneficial for our understanding of speech processing in general.

English summary
One characteristic of casual, connected speech is the acoustic reduction of words.
Words are often not produced as their full forms with all segments carefully articu-
lated, but are pronounced with altered, shortened, or even absent segments. For
instance, the English word apparently has the full form /@phE~R@ntli/, but may be
pronounced as [phE~Ri] or [phE~] (Johnson, 2004). Similarly, the Dutch word natuur-
lijk ‘of course’ with the full form /natyrl@k/ may be reduced to for instance [ntyrl@k],
[tyl@k], or [tyk] (Ernestus, 2000). Acoustic reduction is a highly frequent phenomenon
(e.g., Johnson, 2004; Schuppler et al., 2011) that occurs in many different languages
(Ernestus & Warner, 2011). This dissertation investigates how speakers and listeners
process acoustic reductions, on the basis of casual Dutch.
Processes underlying acoustic reduction
In Chapters 2 and 3, we aimed at improving our knowledge of the processes underly-
ing the production of reduced pronunciation variants. Two different types of processes
may result in the absence of segments. On the one hand, segments may be absent
as the extreme result of gradient processes: Gradient overlap and decrease in magni-
tude of articulatory gestures may result in the shortening of segments and in extreme
cases in their absence (e.g., Browman & Goldstein, 1990, 1992). On the other hand,
segments may be absent as a result of categorical higher-level processes. A phono-
logical rule may completely delete segments from a word’s full representation (e.g.,
Chomsky & Halle, 1968; McCarthy & Prince, 1993), or the mental lexicon may con-
tain multiple pronunciation variants for each word and a variant in which segments are
completely (categorically) absent may be retrieved directly (e.g., Bürki et al., 2010).
So far, categorical reduction has been identified for processes that only affect highly
frequent words or word combinations (e.g., /e/-deletion in French c’était /setE/ ‘it was’;
Torreira & Ernestus, 2011) or affect words in both casual and formal speech or both
in context and in isolation (e.g., word-internal schwa deletion in French; Bürki et al.,
2010). We investigated whether highly frequent reduction processes that affect many
word types, but only in casual, connected speech, can also be categorical in nature.
We focused on reduction of schwa in prefixes and on word-final /t/ in Dutch past
participles (e.g., gewenst /x@wEnst/ ‘wished’). If a segment’s absence and duration
are conditioned by the same variables, we hypothesize that they result from the same
111
English summary
shortening process, which in extreme cases results in the absence of a segment. If
its absence is conditioned by different variables than its duration, we hypothesize that
its absence results from categorical processes.
Chapter 2 presents a corpus study based on tokens of past participles extracted
from recordings of casual conversations. Its results demonstrate that the absence and
duration of /t/ are affected by approximately the same variables. For schwa, the data
show that its absence is affected by different and more variables than its duration.
These results strongly suggest that the absence of schwa, a reduction phenomenon
that occurs in many word types and only in casual, connected speech, may also result
from a categorical process.
This categorical process could be a phonological rule that deletes the schwa. Be-
cause our analyses show that words differ substantially in how often they occur with-
out schwa, this rule then has to apply to different words with different frequencies.
Word-specific rules or word-specific application frequencies are computationally diffi-
cult to distinguish from the assumption that the variants without schwa are stored in
the mental lexicon, together with their frequencies of occurrence. Our results there-
fore support psycholinguistic models assuming that, for a large number of words, the
mental lexicon does not store just one, but multiple pronunciation variations per word.
In Chapter 3, we aimed at replicating the results of our corpus study in a controlled
production experiment. We conducted a shadowing experiment, in which participants
listened to sentences produced in a careful or casual way and repeated these sen-
tences. In the participants’ productions of the sentences, the absence of /t/ was
conditioned by the same variables as its duration, suggesting that its absence mostly
resulted from extreme shortening. These results support those obtained in the corpus
study. The same results were obtained for the absence of schwa, which is not in line
with the data from the corpus study. This raised the question what could account for
this discrepancy in results for schwa. Further inspection of the recordings indicated
that participants did not aim at repeating the pronunciation variants of the words they
heard, but at producing the words’ full forms. In addition, participants never produced
drastically reduced forms that are typical of casual, connected speech (e.g., eigenlijk
/EIx@l@k/ was never reduced to [EIk]). This indicates that the shadowing experiment
elicited non-casual fast speech, which may explain why we did not find evidence for
categorical absence of schwa, as reported in the corpus study.
Our finding that the absence of schwa may result from a categorical process in
casual speech, whereas it typically results from extreme shortening in less casual
speech, raises questions about the production processes underlying different speech
styles. If other reduction processes that are categorical in casual, connected speech
are gradient in less casual speech, the production processes underlying different
speech styles may be qualitatively different: the role that lexical representations for
reduced pronunciation variants play during speech production then depends on the
speech style.
112
Mental representation and processing of reduced words in casual speech
Further, this finding is in line with exemplar-based models (e.g., Bybee, 2001, p. 35;
Goldinger, 1998) and hybrid models (e.g., Goldinger, 2007; McLennan et al., 2003),
which both assume that the mental lexicon contains representations of all occur-
rences of a word that a language user has ever encountered (i.e., exemplars).
In Chapter 4, we further examined evidence for these models. A role for exemplars
in speech processing is supported by earlier studies of speech comprehension using
long-term identity priming. These studies report larger priming effects for words that
are primed by acoustically identical primes than by primes that differ in, for instance,
the speaker or the realization of a certain segment (e.g., Bradlow et al., 1999; McLen-
nan et al., 2003). We investigated how robust these exemplar effects are for reduced
pronunciation variants by studying whether exemplar effects also arise in conditions
more similar to natural conversations than in earlier experiments.
Our study consists of four long-term priming experiments with lexical decision tasks.
A prime and target represented the same word type and were presented with the
same or a different degree of reduction, but were never acoustically identical. Only
Experiment 1 showed exemplar effects. This was the most basic experiment in which
participants were presented with one type of variation (i.e., degree of reduction), parti-
cipants heard only one speaker, the lag between primes and targets was small (max-
imally 100 trials), and a large proportion of the words were primed (33%), which
probably made it clear to the participants that many words in the experiment were
repeated. This experiment was most similar to earlier priming experiments showing
exemplar effects.
The other three experiments tested exemplar effects under conditions more similar
to those of natural conversations. In Experiments 2 and 4, a smaller proportion of
words were primed (12%) and the lag between primes and targets was longer (maxi-
mally 805 trials); in Experiments 3 and 4, participants were presented with differences
in both degree of reduction and speaker voice (participants heard two speakers).
None of these experiments showed any exemplar effects. This suggest that, in a sit-
uation where more variation is available to the listener, as in natural conversations,
exemplars play a smaller role than has been previously assumed. Exemplars ap-
pear only relevant in situations where a stimulus is likely to be repeated, and where
accessing exemplars may thus be helpful for word recognition. A possible explana-
tion of the findings in our study and in the other studies reporting exemplar effects is
that exemplars are not part of the mental lexicon but are stored in episodic memory.
The fact that episodic memories are not very stable is in line with our findings that
exemplar effects are not very robust.
Morphology
In Chapter 5, we examined whether a word’s morphological structure affects the re-
duction degree of its segments. For instance, English /t/ and /d/ have been reported
to be less reduced when they form an affix on their own, as in rapped, than when
113
English summary
they are part of longer morphemes, as in rapt (e.g., Losiewicz, 1992). We examined
this question by discussing and re-analyzing data from the literature. Moreover, we
contrasted this morphological structure hypothesis with the word information load hy-
pothesis that states that a segment’s reduction degree is influenced by its relevance
for the identification of the entire word, regardless of its morphological structure.
Our review discussed studies investigating effects of the repetition of a morpheme
(Viebahn et al., 2012), of whether a segment plays a crucial role in the identification
of its morpheme (Losiewicz, 1992; Schuppler et al., 2012; new analyses based on
the data of Chapter 2), and of a word’s morphological decomposability (Hay, 2003;
Schuppler et al., 2012; Bürki, Ernestus, et al., 2011; Chapter 2). Our analyses
revealed that the studies reviewed either do not report convincing evidence that mor-
phological structure influenced acoustic reduction, or they report data that are open
to alternative interpretations. Word information load appears to play a more important
role in the production of reduced words. Furthermore, the studies that investigated
the role of a word’s morphological decomposability used different measures for de-
composability, without providing clear argumentation for their measures. To under-
stand the role of decomposability in acoustic reduction, we need a uniform definition
of morphological decomposability.
These findings contrast with the expectations of several models of morphological
processing, such as traditional models assuming that regular complex words are al-
ways computed from their morphemes (e.g., Chomsky & Halle, 1968; Pinker, 1991;
Taft & Ardasinski, 2006) or models that assume that words can be processed via a
direct and a decomposition route (e.g., Schreuder & Baayen, 1995). The data col-
lected so far support psycholinguistic models which assume that all morphologically
complex words are processed as complete units (e.g., Bybee, 2001; Skousen, 1989).
Individual differences
Language users have a multitude of different words at their disposal, and individu-
als may differ in their choice of words (e.g., the words begin and start can often be
interchanged). In addition to the choice of words, speakers may also differ in the
degree to which they reduce these words. In Chapter 6, we studied a homogeneous
group of speakers with the same social background and investigated whether and
how these twenty speakers differ in their choice and degree of reduction of words
when engaged in casual conversation. Earlier studies (e.g., Guy, 1980; Keune et al.,
2005) have shown that social groups of speakers, for instance based on gender or
educational level, differ in the way they pronounce words. Speakers within a social
group should therefore display similar speech patterns. Nevertheless, we found that a
classifier was able to correctly classify 79.9% of unseen speech fragments as belong-
ing to one of the speakers, which indicates that clear differences may exist between
individual speakers belonging to the same social group.
114
Mental representation and processing of reduced words in casual speech
These speakers differed in the words they used (i.e., lexical choice) and in how
they pronounced these words. Differences in lexical choice concerned mainly function
words, such as om ‘to’ and ze ‘they’, and content words that are semantically weak as
they provide no indication of the topic of the conversation, such as nee ‘no’ and goed
‘good’. In the literature on authorship attribution (see Koppel et al., 2009; Stamatatos,
2009), content words are often regarded as being topic dependent and therefore as
being less useful for the identification of the author of a text. Our results suggest that
the usage of certain content words, namely semantically weak ones, may also be
beneficial for authorship attribution.
Differences in the speakers’ pronunciations were found for single phones (e.g., pro-
nunciation of /x/) and for phones given both the preceding and following phone (e.g.,
the pronunciation of /l/ in the sequence /Al@/). The pronunciation differences that we
found were often only represented by a few words, mostly semantically weak ones.
For instance, differences in the pronunciation of /x/ were mainly based on /nOx/ nog
‘yet’ and /tOx/ toch ‘still’ and variation in the sequence /Al@/ mainly resulted from
variation in the word /Al@mal/ allemaal ‘all’. Hence, speakers differ not only from
each other in the use of semantically weak words but also in the degree to which they
reduce these words, even if these speakers belong to the same social group.
Current psycholinguistic models explain how the average speaker produces speech.
To incorporate our results, these models need to adopt the assumption that speech
production processes and the mental lexicon may not be equal for all speakers.
Methodology
While conducting the studies described above, we encountered three main types of
methodological challenges. The first of these concerns the statistical analysis of cor-
pus data and experimental data. In Chapters 2, 3, and 4, we used mixed effects
regression models. Analyses first led to the inclusion of a high number of fixed effects
and interactions, many of which had very small effect sizes, were uninterpretable
higher-order interactions, or were not replicable and probably resulted from overfit-
ting. To improve the reliability of our results, we adopted more conservative statistical
approaches: In Chapters 2 and 3, we used the Akaike Information Criterion for the
selection of fixed effects, and in Chapter 4, we restricted our analyses to interac-
tions between the predictors of interest. In Chapter 5, we also encountered statistical
challenges: we showed that not only the selection of the best statistical model has
to be conducted with care, but also the interpretation of this model. We questioned
the interpretations of data patterns revealed reported in the literature. For instance,
some studies based their conclusions on the comparison of two small sets of words
that not only differed in morphological structure but also in other properties, such as
frequency of occurrence. These differences in other properties may be responsible
for the difference in pronunciation observed between these two sets of words. Alter-
115
English summary
native hypotheses should therefore be carefully considered before strong conclusions
are drawn.
We encountered our second methodological challenge in Chapter 6, in which we
classified speakers on the basis of their choice and pronunciation of words. The
classification method is informative as it provides insights in the differences between
the speaker’s choice and pronunciation of words, but this method has not often been
used to study individual differences in pronunciation variation. We therefore had to
develop a new approach to adapt this method for our research question.
The third challenge that we encountered concerns the type of speech that we in-
vestigated, namely casual, connected speech. Corpus studies allow us to investigate
speech phenomena as they occur in natural conversations. However, casual con-
versations typically contain many high frequency words and very few low frequency
words and the word types that can be investigated on the basis of a corpus is there-
fore limited. Moreover, the tokens of words or segment sequences that a researcher
may want to compare may occur in very different contexts or differ in many other re-
spects. For instance, /t/ occurs in different positions in the words tree, notable, and
accept, and these words also differ in, for instance, their prosodic structure, length,
word type, and word frequency. These differences may be difficult to determine, mak-
ing it difficult to investigate why one speech unit differs from another. Researchers
therefore prefer to work with data elicited in experiments which are designed to con-
tain the exact speech units under investigation and to elicit them under very similar
conditions. However, as the shadowing task used in one of our experiments (Chap-
ter 3) was unable to elicit casual speech, still more research is required in order to
find an experimental paradigm that allows us to study casual, connected speech. Cur-
rently, research needs to use both corpus and experimental studies complementarily,
which ideally will provide converging evidence.
Concluding remarks
This dissertation focused on reduction processes that are typical for casual conver-
sational Dutch. We addressed the difficulties of studying how speakers produce and
how listeners understand this type of speech and showed the importance of conduct-
ing corpus studies and experimental research complementarily.
The results of our studies provide important information about how speakers and
listeners process reduced speech. They show that reduction phenomena that occur
in many word types and only in casual, connected speech may result from gradient
as well as categorical reduction processes. Furthermore, they show that the role of
exemplars in the comprehension of reduced speech may be smaller than previously
assumed. Our results also indicate that there is currently no convincing evidence that
morphological structure plays a substantial role in the production of reduced speech.
Finally, they demonstrate that individual speakers differ in the words they produce and
how they pronounce these words.
116
Mental representation and processing of reduced words in casual speech
These findings also provide information about speech processing in general, more
specifically about the nature and the role of lexical representations. They suggest
that the mental lexicon stores morphologically complex words as entire units and that
it stores multiple pronunciation variants per word, but not in the form of exemplars.
Finally, the mental lexicon and speech processes may not be equal for all speakers.
Research on casual, connected speech is thus not only beneficial for gaining a better
understanding of how speakers and listeners process casual, connected speech, but
also for our understanding of speech processing in general.

Nederlandse samenvatting
In alledaagse spontane spraak worden veel klanken niet volledig uitgesproken. Spre-
kers kunnen klanken veranderen, verkorten of helemaal weglaten. Ze kunnen bijvoor-
beeld natuurlijk uitspreken als ntuurlijk, tuulijk of tuuk en eigenlijk als eiglijk, eigek of
eik (Ernestus, 2000). Dit is een veelvoorkomend fenomeen (bijv. Johnson, 2004;
Schuppler et al., 2011) dat akoestische reductie genoemd wordt en in vele verschil-
lende talen voorkomt (Ernestus & Warner, 2011). Mijn proefschrift bevat verschillende
studies naar akoestisch gereduceerde spraak.
Alle studies in dit proefschrift onderzoeken spontane lopende spraak in het Neder-
lands. Het doel van deze studies was om meer te weten te komen over hoe sprekers
en luisteraars met gereduceerde spraak omgaan. Hoe produceren sprekers gere-
duceerde woorden en hoe worden deze door luisteraars verwerkt? Worden gere-
duceerde woorden ook opgeslagen in ons mentale woordenboek? Als dat zo is, hoe
zien de representaties van deze gereduceerde woorden er uit? Antwoorden op deze
vragen helpen ons bij het verbeteren van theorieën over spreken en luisteren in het
algemeen.
Reductieprocessen
Het doel van Hoofdstuk 2 en 3 was om meer inzicht te krijgen in de manier waarop
sprekers woorden en klanken reduceren. Er zijn grofweg twee verschillende pro-
cessen die ervoor kunnen zorgen dat klanken niet uitgesproken worden. Het eerste
proces is een gradueel proces en houdt in dat een spreker een klank verkort door
hem gedeeltelijk tegelijkertijd met omringende klanken uit te spreken of door hemzelf
te verkorten (bijv. Browman & Goldstein, 1990, 1992). In sommige gevallen leidt dit
ertoe dat een klank zo verkort wordt dat hij helemaal niet meer te horen is. Een
spreker kan bijvoorbeeld het woord gewenst beginnen uit te spreken en de uh-klank
in ge zo verkorten dat het woord uiteindelijk klinkt als gwenst. De afwezigheid van de
uh-klank is dan het extreme gevolg van een gradueel verkortingsproces.
Het tweede proces houdt in dat een klank niet tijdens de uitspraak verloren gaat,
maar al op een eerder moment. Een klank wordt dan niet extreem verkort, maar
is volledig afwezig doordat hij door de spreker niet gepland is. Dit wordt categoriale
reductie genoemd. Categoriale reductie kan ontstaan doordat een spreker een woord
uit zijn mentale woordenboek ophaalt en regels toepast die klanken weghalen (bijv.
119
Nederlandse samenvatting
Chomsky & Halle, 1968). Als de spreker het woord gewenst ophaalt, kan een regel
bijvoorbeeld stellen dat de uh-klank verwijderd kan worden. Een andere mogelijkheid
is dat sprekers kunnen kiezen uit verschillende uitspraken opgeslagen in hun mentale
woordenboek. Ze hebben bijvoorbeeld gewenst opgeslagen, maar ook gwenst en
gwens. Sprekers kunnen dan een uitspraak ophalen, zoals gwenst, waarin één of
meerdere klanken volledig afwezig zijn (bijv. Bürki et al., 2010).
We hebben onderzocht of categoriale reductie voorkomt in Nederlandse voltooid
deelwoorden, zoals gewenst, als deze uitgesproken worden in spontane lopende
spraak. In deze woorden worden de uh-klank in ge en de laatste t-klank vaak gere-
duceerd. We hebben onderzocht in welke omstandigheden deze klanken worden
verkort en in welke omstandigheden ze afwezig zijn. In een verzameling opnames
van spontane gesprekken en in opnames van minder spontane spraak uitgelokt in
een experiment, was de t-klank afwezig in dezelfde omstandigheden als de om-
standigheden waarin hij verkort werd. Dit geldt ook voor de uh-klank in de minder
spontane spraak van ons experiment. Omdat de klanken afwezig zijn in dezelfde om-
standigheden als waarin ze verkort worden, concluderen we dat dezelfde processen
de reductie veroorzaken. In deze gevallen is een klank dus voornamelijk afwezig als
gevolg van graduele verkortingsprocessen.
Daarentegen was de uh-klank in spontane spraak vaak afwezig in omstandighe-
den waarin hij niet erg verkort wordt. De uh-klank is bijvoorbeeld vaak afwezig als
de voorafgaande g-klank erg lang was, terwijl het voor de verkorting van de uh-klank
niet uitmaakt wat de lengte van de voorafgaande g-klank is. Dit geeft aan dat de uh-
klank in spontane spraak onderhevig kan zijn aan zowel graduele als categoriale pro-
cessen. Verdere analyses toonden aan dat deze categoriale processen waarschijnlijk
geen regels zijn die toegepast worden, maar dat een gereduceerde uitspraak uit ons
mentale woordenboek gehaald kan worden. Het woord gewenst is dus niet alleen
opgeslagen als gewenst in ons mentale woordenboek, maar ook als gwenst en we
gebruiken gwenst vooral in spontane conversaties.
Deze bevinding komt overeen met theorieën die aannemen dat een aparte repre-
sentatie van een woord opgeslagen wordt elke keer dat een spreker het woord zegt of
een luisteraar het woord hoort. Deze opgeslagen representaties bevatten informatie
over de precieze uitspraak van het woord en worden exemplars genoemd. Verschil-
lende studies vermelden dat exemplars een rol spelen in het herkennen van spraak
(bijv. Bradlow et al., 1999; Craik & Kirsner, 1974; Goh, 2005; McLennan et al., 2003).
Sommige van deze studies suggereren dat de rol van exemplars niet in alle om-
standigheden duidelijk naar voren komt (bijv. Bradlow et al., 1999; McLennan et al.,
2003).
In Hoofdstuk 4 hebben we onderzocht hoe robuust de rol van exemplars is in de
herkenning van gereduceerde woorden. Dit hebben we gedaan door de rol van ex-
emplars te onderzoeken in vier experimenten, die verschillen in de mate waarop ze
op natuurlijke conversaties lijken. In de experimenten die meer op natuurlijke conver-
saties lijken, hoorden de proefpersonen bijvoorbeeld niet één maar twee sprekers en
120
Mental representation and processing of reduced words in casual speech
meer verschillende woorden. In slechts één van deze experimenten vinden we aan-
wijzingen voor exemplars. Dit experiment komt het meest overeen met eerdere stu-
dies en het minst met natuurlijke conversaties. Omdat exemplars alleen een duidelijke
rol spelen in het meest uitgeklede experiment, is de rol van exemplars in de herken-
ning van gereduceerde woorden minder robuust dan eerder werd gedacht.
Morfologie
In Hoofdstuk 5 hebben we onderzocht of de reductie van klanken in een woord beïn-
vloed wordt door de morfologische structuur van het woord. Morfologie is de studie
naar de kleinste betekenisvolle eenheden van een taal, die morfemen worden ge-
noemd. Elk woord bestaat uit één of meerdere morfemen. Het woord tafel bijvoor-
beeld bestaat uit één morfeem en het woord eettafel uit twee morfemen (eet en tafel).
Omdat niet elk morfeem zelfstandig gebruikt kan worden, zijn morfemen niet per
definitie gelijk aan woorden. Bijvoorbeeld, in het woord tafels geeft het morfeem s
de meervoudsvorm aan, maar dit morfeem kan niet zelfstandig gebruikt worden.
Verschillende studies suggereren dat de morfologische structuur van een woord
invloed heeft op de reductie van de klanken in dit woord (bijv. Losiewicz, 1992; Hay,
2003; Schuppler et al., 2012; Bürki, Ernestus, et al., 2011). De hypothese van deze
studies is dat een klank die belangrijk is voor de herkenning van een morfeem, min-
der snel gereduceerd zal worden. In regelmatige Nederlandse voltooid deelwoorden,
zoals gewenst, vormt de laatste t-klank een eigen morfeem en zou daarom niet snel
gereduceerd moeten worden. In Hoofdstuk 5 hebben we een aantal studies bespro-
ken en laten we zien dat er op dit moment geen overtuigend bewijs is voor deze hy-
pothese. Onze resultaten toonden aan dat een klank minder snel gereduceerd wordt
als deze belangrijk is voor de herkenning van het gehele woord, ongeacht de mor-
fologische structuur van het woord. De t-klank in regelmatige voltooid deelwoorden
wordt bijvoorbeeld vaker gereduceerd in gewenst dan in gepraat. In gewenst geeft
de t-klank alleen maar aan dat het een voltooid deelwoord betreft en is niet erg van
belang voor de herkenning van het hele woord. In gepraat is deze klank niet alleen
van belang voor de herkenning van het type woord (voltooid deelwoord), maar ook
voor de herkenning van de stam praat. Het is daarom relevant voor de herkenning
van het woord in zijn geheel.
Morfologie speelt dus geen grote rol in akoestische reductie. Dit komt niet overeen
met theorieën die veel belang hechten aan morfologie en die stellen dat sprekers
bijvoorbeeld gewenst kunnen zeggen door de morfemen ge, wens en t op te halen
uit hun mentale woordenboek (bijv. Chomsky & Halle, 1968; Pinker, 1991; Taft & Ar-
dasinski, 2006; Schreuder & Baayen, 1995). Onze bevindingen komen wel overeen
met theorieën die stellen dat alle woorden in hun geheel opgehaald worden uit het
mentale woordenboek (bijv. Bybee, 2001; Skousen, 1989). Niet alleen simpele woor-
den zoals eet, tafel en wens zijn opgeslagen en worden in hun geheel verwerkt, maar
ook complexe woorden als eettafel en gewenst.

Nederlandse samenvatting
Individuele verschillen
Alle sprekers reduceren hun spraak in spontane gesprekken. Eerder onderzoek heeft
laten zien dat sprekers die tot verschillende sociale groepen behoren, verschillen in
de mate waarin ze reduceren. Woorden als moeilijk en natuurlijk worden bijvoor-
beeld vaker tot moeik en tuuk gereduceerd door mannen dan door vrouwen (Keune
et al., 2005). Om dit verschil tussen mannen en vrouwen te kunnen vinden, moeten
er overeenkomsten zijn in de spraak van de sprekers binnen zo’n groep. In Hoofd-
stuk 6 hebben we onderzocht of er binnen zo’n groep ook verschillen te vinden zijn:
we hebben onderzocht of een groep van twintig Nederlandse mannen met dezelfde
sociale achtergrond verschillen in de woorden die ze gebruiken en de manier waarop
ze deze woorden reduceren.
Op basis van een grote verzameling spraakopnames hebben we automatisch be-
paald welke woorden deze sprekers uitgesproken hebben. Daarnaast hebben we
voor deze woorden bepaald welke klanken uitgesproken, veranderd of afwezig zijn.
Op basis van de woorden en uitspraken heeft een computerprogramma geleerd om
voor een onbekend spraakfragment te bepalen welke spreker het uitgesproken heeft.
Hoewel onze sprekers dezelfde achtergrond hebben en hun spraak op elkaar zou
moeten lijken, was dit programma in staat om dit voor 79.9% van de spraakfrag-
menten goed te doen. Het computerprogramma kan dus onderscheid maken tussen
de sprekers, wat aan geeft dat de sprekers onder andere van elkaar moeten ver-
schillen in de mate waarin ze woorden reduceren. Een voorbeeld waarin ze ver-
schillen is de uitspraak van het woord allemaal. Sommige sprekers verkorten dit
woord meestal tot amal, terwijl andere sprekers voorkeur hebben voor een minder
gereduceerde variant als almal of allemaal.
Deze studie toont aan dat sprekers duidelijk van elkaar verschillen in de woor-
den die ze gebruiken en de mate waarin ze woorden reduceren, ook al hebben ze
dezelfde sociale achtergrond. Theorieën beschrijven gewoonlijk hoe spraak gepro-
duceerd wordt in algemene zin en houden daarbij geen rekening met individuele ver-
schillen tussen sprekers. Om onze bevindingen op te nemen, zouden deze theorieën
moeten aannemen dat het mentale woordenboek en de spraakproductie-processen
niet per definitie voor alle sprekers gelijk zijn.
Algemene conclusies
Dit proefschrift beschrijft onderzoek naar hoe sprekers en luisteraars verkorte uit-
spraakvarianten van woorden verwerken. We toonden aan dat de afwezigheid van
een klank het resultaat kan zijn van zowel graduele processen als categoriale pro-
cessen: een spreker kan een klank extreem verkorten, waardoor deze niet meer hoor-
baar is, en kan ook een gereduceerd woord uit zijn mentale woordenboek ophalen.
Verder lieten we zien dat luisteraars bij de herkenning van gereduceerde woorden
minder gebruik maken van exemplars (oftewel opgeslagen woorden met details over
122
Mental representation and processing of reduced words in casual speech
de precieze uitspraak) dan eerder gedacht werd. Daarnaast worden sprekers niet
sterk beïnvloed door morfologie wanneer ze woorden in een gereduceerde vorm uit-
spreken. Ten slotte laten onze resultaten zien dat individuele sprekers van elkaar
verschillen in de mate waarin ze woorden reduceren.
Onze bevindingen verschaffen ook informatie over het verwerken van spraak in
algemene zin en over de representaties van woorden in ons mentale woordenboek.
Ze suggereren dat ons mentale lexicon bestaat uit in hun geheel opgeslagen woorden
en dat het meerdere uitspraken per woord bevat, maar niet in de vorm van exemplars.
Een woord als gewenst is dus niet opgeslagen als ge, wens en t, maar als gewenst.
Verder zijn er uitspraken opgeslagen zoals gewenst en gwenst, maar is er niet een
aparte representatie voor elke keer dat een spreker gwenst heeft uitgesproken of
gehoord. Ten slotte zijn de mentale woordenboeken van sprekers niet per definitie
identiek en kunnen sprekers verschillen in de manier waarop ze spreken. Onderzoek
naar spontane spraak is dus niet alleen van belang om een beter begrip te krijgen
van hoe sprekers en luisteraars reducties in spontane spraak verwerken, maar ook
voor ons begrip van het verwerken van spraak in het algemeen.

Acknowledgments
Now that my dissertation is finished, it’s finally time to thank everyone who has been
there for me and helped me during this journey. I won’t be able to name everyone
individually, but I am grateful to each and every one of you!
The person I am most indebted to is Mirjam Ernestus. Thank you Mirjam, for al-
ways making time for questions and discussions, for providing critical but constructive
feedback, for reading papers over and over again as if you’d never seen them before,
for always being optimistic and enthusiastic, and for providing a great and inspiring
working environment. I would not have been able to write this dissertation without
you.
I am also very thankful for all the help I received from my second promoter Lou
Boves. Whenever I got stuck and needed someone who was not too involved in
the analyses or other stages of the research process, you were available with fresh
ideas and new insights. You were also typically the first person besides other authors
to provide feedback on my papers. In addition, your knowledge on classification and
classifiers was highly valuable when I was conducting the individual differences study.
Also my third promoter, Anne Cutler, deserves many thanks: my PhD journey would
not have started if you hadn’t provided funding for the first year of the project. Fur-
thermore, I am grateful for your comments on the chapters of my dissertation and for
the opportunity to attend many of your bi-weekly Language Comprehension Group
meetings at the Max Planck Institute, which have taught me a great deal.
Besides my promoters, I also want to express my gratitude to numerous other peo-
ple. Thanks to my colleagues at the CLSM research group, the Linguistics depart-
ment, and the Max Planck Institute for creating a pleasant atmosphere to work in. I
want to extend my appreciation to Roger for improving my English and to the Techni-
cal Group of the Max Planck Institute for keeping all systems up and running.
Furthermore, I thank Barbara and Ellen. I was very happy with our collaborations
and believe that both were very fruitful and resulted in nice papers. Barbara, espe-
cially thanks for providing automatically generated transcriptions of Mirjam’s corpus
and part of the CGN, and for helping me create my own transcriptions. This made the
extraction of data a lot easier!
Without student assistants, I would not have been able to conduct all the experi-
ments within a relatively short time frame. Thank you, Corine, Ferdy, Henriette, Ilse,
Ingrid, Jens, Lieke, Martijn, Nadia, and Tijl, for running these experiments with in total
135
Acknowledgments
380(!) participants. Many thanks to Corine and Jens for their patience with repetitively
recording large numbers of stimuli for these experiments.
Additionally, I’d like to thank Annika, Anton, Arina, Dan, Esther, Esther, Helen, Huib,
Jessamyn, Juliane, Karin, Kim, Laura, Louis, Malte, Marco, Mirjam, Mybeth, Nienke,
Rian, Sho, Sophie, Thordis, Wieke, and Xaver for our daily lunches. They were wel-
come breaks in my daily life as a PhD student. Special thanks to the people I shared
an office with: Ellen, Francisco, Kim, Malte, Marco, and Mybeth. You were great office
mates, who were always in for short chats or extensive discussions. Linsey and Merel,
thanks for all our gezellige lunches and dinners. I enjoyed comparing the progress
of our projects, discussing our frustrations and successes, and chatting about every-
thing else unrelated to research. Thank you, Linsey and Mybeth, for agreeing to be
my paranymphs and supporting me during the final steps of my PhD journey.
I would also like to thank Marcel and Mirjam for their inspiration and feedback on the
design of the cover. For those of you who don’t recognize the wave forms: The cover
depicts two pronunciations of schwa, which has been the focus of multiple studies
described in this dissertation. The orange waveform illustrates a clearly produced
and unreduced schwa, and contrasts with the black waveform that depicts a present,
but heavily reduced schwa.
Ten slotte nog een paar bedankjes in het Nederlands: Pap, mam en overige familie,
bedankt voor al jullie vertrouwen en interesse in mijn promotieproject en voor jullie
geduld en begrip, wanneer ik weer eens niet op bezoek kon komen omdat ik het te
druk had. Last but definitely not least: Marcel, heel erg bedankt voor je steun, liefde
en vertrouwen en vooral dat je ervoor gezorgd hebt dat ik me ook met andere dingen
bezig hield dan mijn proefschrift!

Curriculum Vitae
Iris Hanique was born in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, on 18 August 1985. After
obtaining her vwo diploma from St. Willibrord Gymnasium in Deurne in 2004, she
studied Artificial Intelligence at Radboud University Nijmegen. As part of her studies,
she did an internship at the department of Visual Experiences at Philips Research in
Eindhoven and in 2009 she obtained her master’s degree (bene meritum). In 2010,
Iris started her PhD project at the Centre for Language Studies at Radboud Univer-
sity Nijmegen and the Language Comprehension Group at the Max Planck Institute
for Psycholinguistics. Her research was part of the project Acoustic reduction in Eu-
ropean Languages, which was funded by a European Young Investigator Award from
the European Science Foundation awarded to Mirjam Ernestus. Currently, Iris is a
consultant at Quintiq in ‘s Hertogenbosch and is working on solving planning puzzles
in the metals industry.
