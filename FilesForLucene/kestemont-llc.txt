Abstract
Hildegard of Bingen (1098–1179) is one of the most influential female authors of
the Middle Ages. From the point of view of computational stylistics, the oeuvre
attributed to Hildegard is fascinating. Hildegard dictated her texts to secretaries
in Latin, a language of which she did not master all grammatical subtleties. She
therefore allowed her scribes to correct her spelling and grammar. Especially
Hildegard’s last collaborator, Guibert of Gembloux, seems to have considerably
reworked her works during his secretaryship. Whereas her other scribes were only
allowed to make superficial linguistic changes, Hildegard would have permitted
Guibert to render her language stylistically more elegant. In this article, we focus
on two shorter texts: the Visio ad Guibertum missa and Visio de Sancto Martino,
both of which Hildegard allegedly authored during Guibert’s secretaryship. We
analyze a corpus containing the letter collections of Hildegard, Guibert, and
Bernard of Clairvaux using a number of common stylometric techniques. We
discuss our results in the light of the Synergy Hypothesis, suggesting that texts
resulting from collaboration can display a style markedly different from that of
the collaborating authors. Finally, we demonstrate that Guibert must have re-
worked the disputed visionary texts allegedly authored by Hildegard to such an
extent that style-oriented computational procedures attribute the texts to
Guibert.

1 Introduction
Since the end of the 1960s, literary studies have seen
a clear shift of focus from the analysis of authorial
intentions to reader-oriented criticism. The repudi-
ation of the modern idea of autonomous authorship
has perhaps gone furthest in medieval studies, with
the rise, since the late 1980s, of Material Philology
(Nichols, 1997). Medievalists have become increas-
ingly aware of the importance of manuscript culture
in their understanding of texts: medieval texts
should not primarily be studied, it is argued, as ab-
stract entities resulting from authorial ambitions,
but rather as tangible objects, materialized in

specific manuscript contexts. Every material mani-
festation of a text is unique, because the acts of
copying and compiling nearly always resulted in
textual changes—from minor changes in orthog-
raphy to complete rewritings. Our modern post-ro-
mantic conception of authorship therefore seems
profoundly anachronistic with respect to the
Middle Ages (Cerquiglini, 1999, p. 8–10). Yet,
even if medieval culture did not share our present-
day view on the significance of original authorship,
the Middle Ages have known many respected and
authoritative individuals who were recognized by
their contemporaries and posterior readers as pro-
ducers of very specific literary works. Some kind of
correlation even existed between the degree to
which texts were susceptible to alterations and the
religious and intellectual authority of their authors
(Deploige, 2005).
This did not mean, however, that such recog-
nized authors were necessarily acting individually
in the process of conceiving their treatises or narra-
tives—quite the contrary. Writing in the Middle
Ages meant entering into a dialogue with a long
line of predecessors, whether through citations,
paraphrasing, or allusions. In the actual process of
literary composition too, medieval authors only
seldom worked alone. A ‘new’ text could be the
result of drafts on wax tablets copied by professional
scribes, of processes of dictation and subsequent
correction, etc. A twelfth-century authority like the
Cistercian abbot Bernard of Clairvaux (1090–1153),
one of the most prolific and influential medieval
authors, is known to have been surrounded by a
team of secretaries. For his sermons and letters in
particular, he was assisted by a number of collabor-
ators to whom he could dictate his messages or who
were asked to produce texts in accordance with his
own views. Some of his collaborators were even
trained in imitating his writing style, thus facilitat-
ing Bernard’s work of final editing or correcting
(Leclercq, 1962; 1987, pp. 147–52). In the case of
the remarkably few medieval female authors known
to us, the role of secretaries and collaborators is even
more intricate. Women writers like the German
nuns Hildegard of Bingen (1098–1179) or
Elizabeth of Schönau (1129–1165) were considered
unlearned and incapable of independently writing
down their visionary experiences, even if these
were ‘divinely inspired’. These women therefore
had to be assisted by male collaborators, often also
serving as their spiritual directors. The precise
nature and implications of such cross-gender collab-
orations remain a topic of scholarly debate.
The immediate incentive for the present article is
the preparation of a new critical edition of two
lesser known texts attributed to Hildegard of
Bingen, supposedly dating from the last years of
her life: the Visio de Sancto Martino, which is con-
ceived as a letter addressed to the worshippers of
Saint Martin, and the Visio ad Guibertum missa,
containing spiritual advice to an anonymous
monk-priest, generally identified as her last secre-
tary, Guibert of Gembloux (1124–1213) (Deploige
and Moens, forthcoming). Among the few scholars
who paid attention to these texts, there is still no
consensus as to the extent to which they should be
attributed to either Hildegard herself or to her col-
laborator Guibert. As neither traditional stylistic
analysis nor contextual historical research has so
far been able to resolve the problem, we will ap-
proach this issue through a stylometric analysis.
We will focus on three research questions.
First, does stylometry allow for an authorial dif-
ferentiation between the writings of twelfth-century
Latin authors, belonging to highly similar intel-
lectual circles? To answer this question, we will
investigate the letter collections or epistolaria of
Hildegard of Bingen, her secretary Guibert of
Gembloux, and their famous contemporary,
Bernard of Clairvaux. Our aim is to assess to what
extent we can distinguish stylistic profiles for these
authors, despite the marked variance within medi-
eval manuscript culture (Cerquiglini, 1999), as well
as the fact that these authors, like many of their
contemporaries, were often assisted by secretaries.
Next, we wish to analyze in more detail to what
extent we can discern in Hildegard’s epistolary
work, the influence of her last secretary, Guibert
of Gembloux. Did her style undergo detectable styl-
istic changes under the editorial assistance of
Guibert, or does the same homogeneous authorial
voice appear throughout her epistolary work?
Finally, we will assess the complex question to
which author we should attribute, at least on
M. Kestemont et al.

stylistic grounds, the visiones at stake in this article.
In answering these research questions, we do not
aim to develop novel stylometric techniques. The
originality of this research is to be found in our
application of a number of well-established tech-
niques to assess their feasibility when dealing with
medieval Latin texts, a textual tradition that until
now has only rarely received attention in computa-
tional authorship attribution. Before addressing
these issues, we will first briefly introduce the state
of research with respect to the so-called Mittarbeiter
problem in the Hildegard scholarship.
2 ‘Uneducated in the Art of
Grammar’
The Benedictine nun Hildegard of Bingen was one
of the most productive female authors of the Middle
Ages (Newman, 1998). After a youth as anchoress at
the abbey of the monks of Disibodenberg in the
Rhineland near Mainz, she ended up as abbess of
her own convent at the nearby Rupertsberg. Her
extensive oeuvre includes genres as diverse as vi-
sionary books, letters, hagiographical texts, treatises
on monastic life, musical compositions, and some
works on physics and medical healing. Considered a
true prophetess, receiving revelations and admon-
itions from God, she enjoyed a special status, even
in the highest ecclesiastical milieux. Her extensive
circle of correspondents, comprising, among others,
popes and the emperor, testifies to her prophetic
reputation. She was therefore able to gain an au-
thority unprecedented for a woman, enabling her
to even criticize the male clergy of her time.
Among the first to approve her visionary gift was
Bernard of Clairvaux, in a letter answering her re-
quest for support. Her female authorship was built
on her recognition as a mouthpiece of God, which
caused her to present herself during her entire life as
a poor and uneducated woman—uneducated pre-
cisely because she was a woman (Deploige, 1998). In
one of her vitae, her biographer Guibert of
Gembloux specifies that she was ‘uneducated as to
her schooling in the art of grammar’ (Derolez,
1988–1989, p. 377). Her status, both as a woman
and an allegedly unlearned prophetess who may not
have had the same type of schooling as young
monks, meant that throughout her life Hildegard
had to be assisted by secretaries (Ferrante, 1998).
Her first and principal secretary was Volmar of
Disibodenberg, who remained her close associate
until his death in 1173. He assisted in the redaction
of the majority of her works. As we can learn from a
famous miniature in the now lost manuscript
(henceforth MS) Wiesbaden, Landesbibliothek, 1,
dating from the end of her life, Hildegard dictated
and wrote drafts on wax tablets, which were subse-
quently copied on parchment and linguistically ‘pol-
ished’ in accordance with the rules of grammar
(Fig. 1). In addition, several Rupertsberg nuns
must have aided their abbess as scribes during this
period, given the number of known manuscripts
produced in Rupertsberg under Hildegard’s super-
vision (Embach, 2003, p. 76, 128–9, 160, 184–5;
Herwegen, 1904, p. 302–8). After Volmar’s death,
Hildegard had to complete her last major visionary
cycle, the Liber divinorum operum (‘Book of the
Divine Works’), with more occasional assistance
by a number of different collaborators from her im-
mediate circle of spiritual acquaintances (Herwegen,
1904, p. 308–15). At the very end of her life, how-
ever, she was unexpectedly joined by Guibert, a
monk from the abbey of Gembloux in Brabant
(nowadays Belgium). Himself a fervent letter
writer and hagiographer (Moens, 2010), he served
as her secretary from 1177 until her death in 1179
(Delehaye, 1889; Ferrante, 1998, p. 122–30).
While even the authenticity of her female author-
ship had not always gone uncontested, until the sem-
inal work by Schrader and Fürhrkötter (1956), a lot
of scholarly efforts have been concerned with the
precise role of Hildegard’s secretaries. Just as for
other female writers working under the direction of
father confessors (Coakley, 2006), the question has
been raised to what extent Hildegard’s secretaries
interfered with the final versions of her works, pos-
sibly generating male, clerical interpretations rather
than original female viewpoints. Following the pion-
eering research by Herwegen (1904), most specialists
now agree that the role of Hildegard’s collaborators
was restricted to minor grammatical and stylistic al-
terations. Generally speaking, they had to copy her
words verbatim unless they received Hildegard’s

explicit authorization for corrections (Schrader and
Führkötter, 1956, p. 182–3; Ferrante, 1998, p. 104).
It is generally assumed, however, that Hildegard
must have granted a somewhat greater liberty to
Guibert, who only entered into her life when she
was already at the very advanced age of 79. Although
their involvement was short, Guibert nevertheless
had a significant impact on Hildegard’s literary

legacy. For example, he may have assisted her as one
of the correctors in the final redaction of the Liber
divinorum operum, of which MS Ghent, University
Library, 241 (Fig. 9), can be considered the auto-
graph copy most true to Hildegard’s own words
(Derolez and Dronke, 1996, pp. XCI–XCIV). He also
aided her in both the writing and compilation of
portions of her epistolarium. On the basis of manu-
script evidence, content, and dating, we can distin-
guish in Hildegard’s letter collection a part that must
have been written and compiled with the help of
Volmar and another group of letters that must
have been written or transmitted under Guibert’s
supervision.1 Last but not least, Guibert is also
thought to have directed the compilation of the so-
called Riesenkodex (MS Wiesbaden, Landesbi-
bliothek, 2), the manuscript in which, by the end of
her life, Hildegard had collected all the authorized
versions of her works (Van Acker, 1989, pp. 129–34).
3 Two Suspect Visions
The Visio de sancto Martino (‘Vision of Saint
Martin’) and Visio ad Guibertum missa (‘Vision
sent to Guibert’), which are at stake in this article,
cannot be found in the Riesenkodex. They are only
preserved in three manuscripts that can be linked to
the abbey of Gembloux and Guibert’s own oeuvre.2
Therefore, both texts are traditionally not included
in the core of Hildegard’s canon (Schrader and
Führkötter, 1956, p. 182; Embach, 2003, p. 469).
Whereas the titles in the manuscripts (Fig. 2), as
well as Guibert’s accompanying letters, firmly attri-
bute these visiones to Hildegard, there are good rea-
sons to suspect that Guibert must have been
extensively involved in their final redaction. The
figure of Saint Martin for instance—the main
topic of the Visio de sancto Martino—is entirely
absent from Hildegard’s oeuvre. Guibert, on the
other hand, developed a lifelong fascination for
this saint and devoted nearly half of his life to
spreading his cult. The Visio ad Guibertum missa
discusses the role of the priest as well as the topic
of literary collaboration, both issues of direct rele-
vance to Guibert. Moreover, the end of the latter
text contains a passage of particular interest in
which Hildegard grants Guibert the exceptional
right to revise her texts more fundamentally than
simply at the level of style and grammar:
When you correct [the Visio de sancto
Martino] and the other works, in the emend-
ing of which your love kindly supports my
deficiency, you should keep to this rule: that
adding, subtracting, and changing nothing,
you apply your skill only to make corrections
where the order or the rules of correct Latin
are violated. Or if you prefer—and this is
something I have conceded in this letter
beyond my normal practice—you need not
hesitate to clothe the whole sequence of the
vision in a more becoming garment of speech,
preserving the true sense in every part. For
even as foods nourishing in themselves do
not appeal to the appetite unless they are sea-
soned somehow, so writings, although full of
salutary advice, displease ears accustomed to
an urbane style if they are not recommended
by some color of eloquence (translated by
Newman, 1987, p. 23)
With this statement, Hildegard allegedly granted
Guibert editorial privileges that she had not allowed
any other previous collaborator. The passage also
prompted scholars to have a closer look at the
authorship, style, and content of these visionary
texts. Already in his 1882 edition, Pitra voiced
doubts with respect to Hildegard’s alleged author-
ship. He stated that Guibert, if not their original
author altogether, must at least have reworked the
texts profoundly. Pitra based his verdict on a
number of syntactical features, on metaphors
which he considered typical of Guibert, and on
the extensive insertion of Biblical quotations
(Pitra, 1882, p. 370–1, 375). Herwegen remained
more cautious: although he accepted that Guibert
had refined the texts stylistically, he still discerned
Hildegard’s authorial voice shimmering through
Guibert’s multiple corrections. He recognized
Hildegard’s genius in the overall structure of the
visions and in some typically Hildegardian vocabu-
lary. He also rejected Pitra’s assertion that the nu-
merous Biblical quotations could only have been
inserted by Guibert (Herwegen, 1904, p. 394–6).
Collaborative authorship in the twelfth century
Literary and Linguistic Computing, 2013 5 of 26
Newman recently stated that the Visio ad Guibertum
missa was ‘written by Guibert in Hildegard’s persona’
(Newman, 1987, p. 24), although Van Acker (1989,
p. 130) and Coakley (2006, p. 61) continued to con-
sider Hildegard as the text’s author and Guibert as a
mere stylistic reviser.
These assertions concerning the authorship of
the visiones seem to have been predominantly
based on subjective appreciations of style and con-
tent and the arguments used in this debate remain,
at best, intuitive. The appearance of a new critical
edition of the visiones once more put the question of
their authorship at the forefront: should the texts be
regarded as Hildegardian or pseudo-Hildegardian?
Stylometric methods may provide a more objective
basis for disentangling the issue and to re-assess the
nature of Guibert’s secretaryship.
4 Corpus Preparation
For the present study, Brepols Publishers generously
provided a digital corpus containing the nearly
complete works of Hildegard, Guibert, and Bernard
of Clairvaux. We obtained these texts in raw format,
corresponding to the way they are included in the
Brepols electronic Library of Latin Texts, on the
basis of modern critical editions.3 Fortunately,
these editions are all based on manuscripts that
were compiled under the supervision of the original
authors or at least in their close vicinity, so that we
do not have to worry about major scribal interven-
tions. The fact that all three authors in our corpus
have been productive letter writers rendered their
epistolaria an attractive point of departure. More-
over, the two short visionary texts of dubious origin
that are at issue in this article are mostly comparable
with Hildegard’s letters with respect to length,
topics, and manuscript tradition. Obviously, we re-
stricted our authors’ letter collections to the letters
they wrote themselves, leaving aside the letters that
were merely addressed to them and that were usu-
ally contained in the same manuscripts (Constable,
1976). For Bernard, this resulted in a sub-corpus of
166,063 words and for Guibert of 124,580 words.4
Hildegard’s letter collection contained 109,633
words, 82,154 of which are contained in the part
compiled with the help of her first secretary

Volmar, while the remaining 27,479 words consti-
tute the letters that, as discussed earlier, have most
probably been edited in some way by Guibert.5
Medieval Latin is characterized by unstable or-
thography. As even a single scribe often used differ-
ent spellings for the same word, modern editors
already tend to silently normalize minor ortho-
graphic variants. We have normalized the orthog-
raphy in our corpus even further via lemmatization,
a useful procedure in stylometry for medieval texts
(Kestemont et al., 2010). The texts were first toke-
nized using the Natural Language Toolkit (Bird
et al., 2009). The coordinating conjunction –que
(‘and’) was not realized as a separate word in medi-
eval Latin, but it was appended to the preceding
word (e.g. terra aquaque, ‘land and water’). To auto-
matically isolate the clitic, we have stripped the
suffix (‘xque’) from every word that did not occur
in a list of words proposed by Schinke et al. (1996,
p. 180–1).6 We have also split up the medieval con-
traction of the reflexive pronoun se and the idiom-
atic reinforcement ipsum in seipsum (or teipsum,
teipsam, etc.).
A number of specific character combinations were
freely interchangeable in medieval Latin, such as ph
for f, v for u, oe or ae for e (or for e, the so-called ‘e
caudata’) (Rigg, 1996). We have therefore lifted the
difference between v and u, as well as between ae, oe,
and e, by substituting all vs for us and all aes and oes
for es. For the substitution of ae and oe by e, this
actually meant that we were sometimes forced to
erase the distinction between grammatically import-
ant morphemes (e.g. between the male vocative sin-
gular domine and the female nominative plural
dominae). Yet, this was unavoidable, as a good deal
of the aes and oes in our corpus were already con-
tracted to es, making it nearly impossible to automat-
ically normalize them the other way round.
Subsequently, we checked whether the surface
tokens in our corpus were present in a large and
representative word list from the Perseus Project
(Tufts University). When a token was not, we used
a permutation algorithm to generate plausible spel-
ling variants for it. If one of these newly generated
forms was contained in the word list, the original
form was replaced by its newly generated counter-
part. To generate these variants, we constructed an
array with all possible variations for the consecutive
character groups. Next, we combined these options
through the Cartesian product in the matrix by
means of a permutation algorithm (Kestemont
et al., 2010). Table 1 lists the series of common alter-
native character combinations we have considered,
loosely based on Riggs (1996).7 An example matrix
for a word like chirographum would be: {[c], [h j Ø],
[i j y], [r], [o], [g], [r], [a], [ph j f], [u], [m]}. All
unique, alternative word spellings that can be gener-
ated on the basis of the matrix are: chirographum, ciro-
graphum, chyrographum, cyrographum, chirografum,
cirografum, chyrografum, and cyrografum.
Finally, we automatically annotated the tokens
with lemmas using the medieval Index Thomisticus
Treebank (IT-TB: Passarotti and Dell’Orletta, 2010)
as training material (ca. 170,000 tokens; ca. 9,000
sentences).8 For the lemmatization of our corpus
we have used Morfette (Chrupala et al., 2008).
Unlike other popular lemmatization tools, such as
TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994), Morfette also lemma-
tizes input tokens that the tagger did not already
encounter verbatim in the training data. Morfette
considers pairs of input tokens and lemmas in the
training material. From these pairs it learns ‘shortest
edit scripts’ or ways to transform tokens into their
lemmas using character insertions, deletions, and re-
placements. An annotated sample from the Visio ad
Guibertum missa is listed as an example (Table 2),
illustrating how this procedure did not manage to
identify all lemmas correctly. Especially content
words that are not typical of Thomas Aquinas’s
scholastic vocabulary were not always recognized.
For the function words used in our analyses (see
below), this problem was fortunately hardly an
issue.

5 Feature Selection
Today’s stylometry has become an umbrella term
for a still growing number of techniques for author-
ship analysis. Each of these has been the subject of
both criticism and praise, making it hard to discern
a consensus on best practice in this field. For this
research too, we had to balance the pros and cons of
a number of tried and tested methodologies. Recent
studies still tend to agree on the undeniable meth-
odological advantages of using function words in
authorship attribution (Binongo, 2003, p. 11). An
author’s use of function words is said, for instance,
to be relatively unaffected by a text’s topic or genre.
(Dis-)similarities between texts regarding function
words are therefore to a certain extent content-in-
dependent and can be more easily associated with
authorship than e.g. content words or other topic-
specific stylistics (Juola, 2006, p. 264–5). Numerous
empirical studies have effectively demonstrated that
analyses of the high-frequency strata of function
words yield reliable indications about a text’s
authorship (Koppel et al., 2009, p. 11–12;
Stamatatos, 2009, p. 540–1). In this research, we
have therefore restricted our analyses to function
words, using a number of approved methods—
many of them implemented in the publicly available
script suite ‘Stylometry with R’ (Eder et al., 2013).
Preliminary analyses showed that the upper tail
of the frequency spectrum in our corpus still con-
tained a good deal of content-rich lemmas. Among
the ca. 200 most frequent lemmas in our entire
corpus, listed in Table 3, we came across multiple
topic-specific nouns like deus, dominus, sanc-
tus, . . . and verbs like facio, uideo, uiuo, . . . The
inclusion of such lemmas obviously reflects the cor-
pus’s fairly specific, religious semantics. It is also
related, however, to the simple fact that a highly
inflected language like Latin with its many declen-
sions makes less use of function words than weakly
inflected languages like English. A third explanatory
factor might be the fact that we worked with the
frequencies of lemmas instead of surface forms. It
thus seemed advisable to remove these content
words from our data tables.
The content-rich words we chose to remove are
marked by a hashtag (#) in Table 3.9 The words
followed by an asterisk (*) in the same Table 3 are
non-reflexive personal pronouns, which are also
often culled in stylometry to avoid the intrusion
of genre-related or topic-specific features.
Naturally, a collection of letters will contain more
instances of the second-person pronouns tu/vos
(‘you’) or tuus/vester (‘your’) than a saint’s life. In
our analyses, we have deleted this kind of pronoun.
Just as in Table 2, one can still distinguish a certain
number of wrongly lemmatized tokens in Table 3.
The surface form sui, for example, often seems to
have remained unchanged, whereas it should have
been transformed into suus. This particular error,
however, is neutralized by our elimination of non-
reflexive personal pronouns.10 In sum, our culling
of the lemmas in Table 3 resulted in 65 function
words with which to form the basis for the actual
analyses.
It should be noted, however, that character
n-grams might have been an attractive additional
feature type for our research, as these have often
been shown to be excellent features in authorship
attribution (Koppel et al., 2009, p. 12–13;
Stamatatos, 2009, p. 541–2). This method, which
does not require any kind of normalization or
lemmatization, segments texts into consecutive, par-
tially overlapping groups of n characters—the word
‘bigram’ for instance contains the bigrams ‘_b’, ‘bi’,
‘ig’, ‘gr’, ‘ra’, ‘am’, ‘m_’. Contrary to a word-level
approach, character n-grams are also sensitive to
stylistic information below the word level, like case
endings or other grammatical morphemes that are

not realized as separate words (Rybicki and Eder,
2011, p. 320). Latin, for instance, is a heavily in-
flected language that makes use of affixes to mark
the grammatical functions of words—‘by iron, not
by sword’ being for example ‘ferro non gladio’
(Sapir, 1921, ch. VI). Therefore, it would have
made sense to additionally study the character
n-grams in the corpus.
However, one runs into the aforementioned
problem that historical languages are characterized
by unstable orthography (Piotrowski, 2012).
Although Latin spelling variation seems to have
been less pronounced than in vernacular medieval
languages, it does constitute a serious issue. When
comparing two texts written by the same author,
surviving in manuscripts with a strongly divergent
orthography, stylometric methods may detect arti-
ficially large differences. Conversely, and likewise
due to scribal interference, texts of non-identical
authorial provenance may show artificial similarities
when they survive in manuscripts with a similar
orthographical profile. In medieval manuscripts,
we might even find inconsistent word spellings for
the same words throughout the same text (Rigg,
1996). This ultimately implies that an approach
based on character n-grams is unadvisable for medi-
eval Latin (cf. Kestemont and Van Dalen Oskam,
2008). Unfortunately, this means that our approach
based on lemmatization cannot take into account
stylistic subtleties below the word level (e.g.

indicative versus subjunctive mood, as expressed in
case endings). However, we will demonstrate that
our method is still able to harvest sufficient stylistic
information from the texts. Indirectly, our results
will therefore even serve to emphasize how much
grammatical information is in fact still expressed
by isolated function words in medieval Latin.
6 Testing Principal Components
Analysis
The first stylometric technique we adopt is principal
components analysis (PCA), a procedure derived
from multivariate statistics and commonly used to
reduce the dimensionality of a data set (Binongo,
2003). By combining the original variables of a data
table into new, uncorrelated compound variables or
‘principal components’, PCA is able to summarize
large and complex data sets into insightful lower-
dimensional scatterplots. When applied to the
frequencies of high-frequency items in texts, this
technique often successfully reveals the authorial
structure in a data set. PCA’s good performance in
authorship attribution is due to the fact that it ex-
plicitly tries to model correlations between word
frequencies. Especially the frequencies of function
words show complex correlations that are related
to stylistic, arguably authorial choices between
small sets of alternative options. A mere visual in-
spection of the samples’ positions in PCA scatterplots
often shows that samples written by the same author
will cluster, whereas groups of samples written by
distinct authors lie further apart.
Because of the considerable size of the epistolaria
in the corpus, we could start with a large sample size
of 10,000 lemmatized words per sample. Recent re-
search has demonstrated that the accuracy of most
authorship attribution techniques is likely to in-
crease when larger samples are taken (Eder, 2010;
Luyckx and Daelemans, 2011). Our selection of the
epistolaria of exactly three authors—Hildegard of
Bingen, Guibert of Gembloux and Bernard of
Clairvaux—respects the fact that it is theoretically
unadvisable to include more than three authors in a
PCA, especially when the discussion of the results is
restricted to the two first Principal Components
(PCs) (Binongo and Smith 1999, p. 464). As is cus-
tomary since Burrows (1987), our PCA is based on
the correlation matrix, appropriately scaling the ori-
ginal word frequencies.
Fig. 3 shows the scatterplot that results from our
first experiment. Each author’s samples are visualized
as black letter combinations: the first letter of the
author’s name is followed by a digit, indicating the
sample’s indexed position in the respective episto-
laria. G_EP-4, for instance, is the fourth sample of
10,000 lemmatized words taken from Guibert’s
epistolarium.11 At this stage, we are restricting
Hildegard’s epistolarium to the letters that are not
associated in any way with Guibert’s secretaryship.
Fig. 3 displays a remarkably clear authorial separ-
ation of the samples. Guibert’s samples (G_EP) are
concentrated in the upper-right quadrant, whereas
the samples from Hildegard’s epistolarium (H_EPNG)
are invariably positioned to the left. Finally, Bernard’s
samples (B_EP) form a tight cluster of samples in the
lower-right half of the plot. The density of this last
cluster thus points at a clear stylistic unity, despite
the fact that, as noted earlier, Bernard must have
been assisted in his epistolary work by a true personal
chancellery consisting of at least five different collab-
orators (Leclercq, 1987, p. 147–52).
Additionally, the plot in Fig. 3 contains a series of
high-frequency items in light grey, the ‘component
loadings’, visualizing how strongly the 65 lemmas
have contributed to the creation of the PCs. If a
word can, for instance, be found to the far left of
the scatterplot, this demonstrates that it is relatively
more frequent in samples with a similar position in
the plot. Our first scatterplot thus shows that the use
of et (‘and’) and a (‘from’) is surprisingly typical of
Guibert’s writings, whereas the use of the prepos-
ition in (‘in’) is very characteristic of the Hildegard
samples. In comparison, the use of the lemmas non
or si seems to be relatively more typical of Bernard’s
writing. The scatterplot does not reveal any anoma-
lies and it is safe to assume that the high-frequency
grammatical lemmas argue in favor of a clear styl-
istic differentiation between our authors.
The remarkable stylistic differences with respect
to a number of specific lemmas used by our authors
can be highlighted in another way. The boxplots in
Fig. 4 visualize information about the absolute

10 of 26 Literary and Linguistic Computing, 2013
frequencies (medians, quartiles, etc.) for three inter-
esting function words—in, et, and non—in samples
of 2,000 words. In boxplot (a) concerning the use of
in, the primary column refers to the counts in
Hildegard; in the second boxplot (b) dealing with
et, the left column concerns Guibert; and in boxplot
(c), with the results for non, Bernard’s results are
displayed in first column. The secondary column in
all three boxplots refers to the material by the two
other authors, e.g. Guibert and Bernard in boxplot
(a). These boxplots indeed reveal unmistakable dif-
ferences between the respective epistolaria with re-
spect to the frequency of these important function
words. Interestingly, these differences coincide with
stylistic observations that have been made in trad-
itional philological research. Given the visionary
discourse developed in much of her writings—
even in her letters—it is not surprising to come
across an intensive use of the preposition in in
Hildegard’s letters. She repeatedly sees things in
divine visions; she continuously searches the alle-
gorical meanings buried in the multitude of details
that she discovers in her visions (Dronke, 1998).
Guibert’s writings are especially notorious for their
all too inflated and artificial style, and Guibert’s
wearisome tendency to compose extremely long

sentences, full of coordinating conjunctions (see
also Derolez, 1988, p. V and IX). Bernard’s frequent
use of non can be related to the didactic nature of
his epistolary expositions in which he very often
relies on an antithetical style to illustrate his
thoughts (Mohrmann, 1958; Pranger, 2011, p. 222).
7 Testing Delta
For our PCA displayed in Fig. 3, we have been work-
ing with extremely generous sample sizes of 10,000
lemmas each. Because the ultimate goal of this art-
icle remains the attribution of the Visio ad
Guibertum missa and the Visio de Sancto Martino
of which the authorship seems very questionable,
the problem of sample size needs to be put forward
(Eder, 2010; Luyckx and Daelemans, 2011): while
the first disputed visio at stake in this article still
contains 7,489 lemmas, the latter only counts
3,301 words. The scatterplots in Fig. 5a and b
show the results of the same procedure as in Fig. 3
but using sample sizes of 5,000 and 1,000 lemmas,
respectively. This clearly illustrates the decrease
in discriminatory performance of our PCA when
we reduce the sample size in our experiments.
Fig. 5b demonstrates that the authorial dis-
crimination becomes less powerful, in particular
between Guibert and Bernard in the vertical
component.
To what extent will we be able to rely on PCA for a
fairly solid attribution of a text, like the Visio de

Sancto Martino, of only ca. 3,000 words? Although
the scatterplots in the previous section demonstrate
the general validity of the stylometric approach for
our corpus, it makes sense to apply a second attri-
bution technique to our corpus to validate the out-
come of the PCA more precisely. Because it is
unfeasible to generate new scatterplots for every
small change in parameter settings like e.g. sample
size in our experiments, we additionally apply
Burrows’s Delta (2002) to the epistolaria.
In its traditional implementation, Delta offers a
similarity metric to determine the authorship of an-
onymous works. Based on the frequencies of a small
set of high-frequency items, Delta computes the
stylistic distance between an unknown sample and
a set of samples written by a series of candidate
authors. It will attribute the anonymous sample to
the author of the (single) sample in the data set to
which it is closest in style according to the metric.
As such, Delta uses a ‘nearest neighbor’ reasoning
(Argamon, 2008). We can apply a ‘leave-one-out
validation’ with Delta as follows. We can temporar-
ily treat each sample in our collection as anonym-
ous. Next, we can have Delta attribute the
anonymized sample to one of the candidate authors
and check whether the suggested attribution is suc-
cessful or not. If at the end of this procedure, we
divide the number of correct attributions by the
total number of samples in the data set, we get a
percentage that offers a useful approximation of the
general effectiveness of our technique, should it, for
instance, be applied to real-world samples of un-
known provenance.
Fig. 6 shows the result of this leave-one-out val-
idation for various sample sizes (multiples of 100
lemmas, ranging from 500 to 4,000). It is obvious
that larger sample sizes invariably lead to higher
accuracies in cross-validation. Yet, whereas the ini-
tial accuracies are fairly low (even < 85%), the attri-
bution success quickly rises above the psychological
barrier of 95% (sample sizes > 1,500 lemmas) and
becomes entirely flawless when dealing with sample
sizes of ca. 3,000 lemmas or more. For a text count-
ing 3,301 lemmas, like the Visio de sancto Martino,
we might well reach an attribution accuracy of
about 99%. Moreover, because these numbers are
in line with earlier reports concerning modern lan-
guages (Eder, 2010; Luyckx and Daelemans, 2011),
Fig. 6 again demonstrates that even a highly in-
flected language like Latin contains a satisfying
amount of useful stylistic information in its gram-
matical lemmas alone.
By now, we can assume that, when applied cau-
tiously, PCA should offer enough solid ground to
make conjectures about the authorship of the vi-
sions in the corpus traditionally attributed to
Hildegard. Following a nearest neighbor reasoning
(Argamon, 2008), we can plot unseen, anonymous
texts together with the works of established author-
ial origin and investigate to which of the authorial
clusters the unseen work is most similar in style.
However, before moving on to the analysis of the
visions, we have first tested this attribution proced-
ure. In the PCA scatterplot in Fig. 7, we have added
a new, ‘anonymous’ sample (amounting to 3,706

lemmas) by author ‘X’ to equal-sized samples from
the aforementioned epistolaria. The new sample
turns out to be stylistically much more similar to
Bernard’s samples than to those by Hildegard or
Guibert. Should this sample have been truly an-
onymous, the analysis would have offered firm
grounds for conjecture that the text from which
the sample is derived is actually authored by
Bernard of Clairvaux. In this specific case, this rea-
soning would have led to a historically sound at-
tribution, as the anonymous text we have
questioned is in reality the Sermo in festo sancti
Martini, written by Bernard around 1150. An
interesting fact about this example is that even
though the topic and genre of this text are perhaps
quite different from the epistolary material of our
candidate authors (viz. a sermon about the afore-
mentioned Saint Martin), it is clear that our PCA
procedure allows for solid conclusions. Although
one should perhaps not always expect such clear-
cut stylistic, authorial differentiation in historical
corpora, this promising example clearly illustrates
the benefits of the present methodology for
(future) research.

8 Guibert’s Secretaryship:
Synergy and Beyond?
As discussed earlier, we have discerned two groups
of letters in Hildegard’s epistolarium: one that must
have originated at the time when Volmar was still
Hildegard’s secretary and that bears no potential
traces of Guibert’s interference, and another con-
taining the letters that are likely to have been revised
by Guibert. If we confront samples of 5,000 lemmas
from both portions, labeled here H_EPNG and
H_EPG, respectively, in a PCA, we get the result in
Fig. 8.
We notice that the first, horizontal PC captures an
impressive 37% of the original variation in our data
and primarily relates to the stylistic differentiation
between Guibert’s own letter collections (G_EP) and
the anterior portion of Hildegard’s epistolarium
(H_EPNG). Interestingly, we see that the second PC
in the right half of the plot (still capturing 9.4% of
the original variation) discriminates between
Hildegard’s non-Guibertian letters and her letters
that can be associated with Guibert’s secretaryship.

These results thus suggest that there do indeed exist
stylistic differences between the oldest portion of
Hildegard’s epistolarium and the letters in which
we expected to discern Guibert’s editorial finger-
prints. They also confirm what can be deduced
from the surviving manuscript evidence. The so-
called autograph copy of the Liber divinorum
operum mentioned earlier offers unique insight
into the way in which Hildegard’s collaborators
must have edited her texts under her supervision
(Derolez, 1972). Fig. 9, showing a number of lines
from the randomly selected page 370 of MS Ghent,
University Library, 241, makes it clear that it was the
function words in particular that were often altered
by Hildegard’s correctors; tam being erased, quod
being replaced by ut or quia, ad being added, etce-
tera. A collaborator—especially Guibert, who is
known to have had a great deal of freedom in his
editorial work—may thus have had a notable
impact on Hildegard’s stylistic profile.
However, in Fig. 8, we see that the samples from
Hildegard’s epistolarium that bear the influence of
Guibert’s interference do not seek the company of
Guibert’s own writings in the scatterplot. After all,
they continue to be somewhat more similar to
Hildegard’s style. This result is reminiscent of
the Synergy Hypothesis, recently discussed by
Pennebaker (2011).12 Pennebaker puts forward
three hypotheses concerning the stylistic effect of
collaborations between different authors. Such pro-
jects can produce a language that is (1) similar to
the one produced by a single person writing alone,
(2) the average of the two writers, or (3) unlike
either of one of the styles that the collaborating au-
thors would produce on their own. Based on ex-
ploratory research on the Federalist papers and
Beatles songs, Pennebaker ultimately argues in
favor of the latter, so-called ‘Synergy view’ on col-
laborative authorship, not refuting however the pos-
sibility that one of the collaborating authors might
have remained more influential with respect to the
end product (cf. Petrie et al., 2008). This Synergy
Hypothesis thus might be applicable to a certain
extent to the Hildegard–Guibert ‘collaboration’,
where the result of the creative process does not
fit in with the other letter samples written by
Hildegard or Guibert individually, although the
result is somewhat more similar to Hildegard.

More can be learned about the stylistic dichot-
omy in Hildegard’s epistolarium by applying a
Mann–Whitney test to the lemmas occurring at
least twice in 4,000 lemma samples. Here, we tem-
porarily leave the realm of high-frequency lemmas
and venture into the lower-frequency strata of the
lexical spectrum. Hence, this test will not particu-
larly emphasize the discriminatory power of high-
frequency lemmas, as was the case with our other
tests (Kilgariff, 2001). Fig. 10 contrasts the words
that were predominantly used in the Hildegard’s
letters written under Volmar’s secretaryship with
those that become typical when Guibert took over
the editorial work in the preservation of her letters.
The lemmas have been ranked and plotted accord-
ing to the U test statistic obtained for each lemma.
Fig. 10 learns how the use of the relative pronoun
qui (‘who’) for instance only becomes prominent in
letters edited by Guibert, who is indeed notorious
for constructing eloquent but complex sentences
with a lot of embedded relative clauses. Moreover,
this latter group of letters is also characterized by a

more dry and stereotypical ecclesiastical vocabulary
(omnipotens, sanctus, spiritus, verus, . . . ), whereas
the letters not influenced by Guibert betray a
more direct and lively narrative style (sed, tunc,
nunc, dico, ergo, deinde, . . . ), possibly more true to
Hildegard’s own preferred way of expressing
herself. We might thus be inclined to agree with
Newman (1987, p. 24) when she stated: ‘Purists
can at least rejoice that the collaboration [between
Guibert and Hildegard] began only after the
seer’s major works were completed’. From the
methodological point of view, these results also
show that the discriminatory effects in lower-
frequency strata correspond with the stylistic di-
chotomy present in the high-frequency vocabulary,
thus corroborating the performance of the latter
methodology.

Let us finally turn to the original incentive
for the present article, namely, the authorship dis-
cussion concerning two texts of dubious proven-
ance: the relatively short Visio de Sancto Martino
about Saint Martin (3,301 lemmas) and the some-
what longer Visio ad Guibertum missa (7,492
lemmas). Fig. 11 offers the result of three PCAs in
which we have confronted both ‘dubia’ (hence
D_MART and D_MISSA) with the previously dis-
cussed epistolary collections, again using the same
65 lemmas and a sample size of 3,301 lemmas. Fig.
11a considers all texts by all authors; Fig. 11b ex-
cludes Bernard’s texts; Fig. 11c only considers
Guibert’s epistolarium and the ‘anonymous’ vision-
ary texts.
All subplots in Fig. 11 clearly show that both
visions tightly cluster with Guibert’s epistolarium,
instead of with Hildegard’s. This effect is perhaps
least prominent in Fig. 11a, where D_MART and
D_MISSA display modest similarities to some of the
epistolary samples from the portion of Hildegard’s
epistolarium that was revised by Guibert. In all three
plots, however, the visions are generally speaking far
more similar to Guibert’s writings than to Hilde-
gard’s. Significantly, most samples resulting from
the combined authorial voices of Hildegard and
Guibert again do not display any significant rap-
prochement to the epistolaria of the individual au-
thors. These observations seem to reinforce the
Synergy Hypothesis. Moreover, the visions’ quasi-

random position in the final subplot (Fig. 11c) re-
veals no pronounced stylistic differences with Gui-
bert’s letters, regarding the high-frequency lemmas
analyzed. They invariably cluster with Guibert’s
epistolary oeuvre, making him a much more plaus-
ible author than Hildegard—at the very least, from a
stylistic point of view.
An important, yet inconspicuous, last feature of
Fig. 11a is that it includes the Sermo in festo sancti
Martini, even though it can hardly be spotted
among Bernard’s other samples. This sermon
deals, just like the Visio de Sancto Martino, with
Saint Martin. Both texts were even clearly influ-
enced by the same late Antique hagiographical
narratives concerning this saint, namely, the
works of his first hagiographers Sulpicius Severus
(c. 363–425) and Gregory of Tours (538–594). It
is interesting to note that despite their interwo-
venness within the same intertextual tradition,
they are still clearly distinguished and therefore
demonstrate that topic-related stylistics hardly
interferes with the author-related differences. The
visionary texts under investigation thus betray
Guibert’s stylistic influence to such an advanced
extent that we could wonder whether we should
not entirely attribute these texts to Guibert, in-
stead of arguing for any form of ‘synergetical col-
laboration’, as was still possible for the portion of
the epistolarium over which both Hildegard and
Guibert labored.

9 Conclusions
It is obvious that the experiments reported in this
article only touch the tip of the iceberg of the
research on Hildegard’s complicated authorship,
to say nothing of the exciting, broader topic of
twelfth-century Latin writing. As stated in our
Introduction, individuality and authorship
remain complex issues when it comes to medieval
literature. Even an authoritative and highly idio-
syncratic author like Bernard of Clairvaux is
known to have been assisted by a team of collab-
orators. It is moreover clear that medieval scribes
often gradually introduced errors and deviations
when successively copying exemplars, thus pos-
sibly altering the original authors’ style in the
surviving copies of texts. Nevertheless, we hope
to have demonstrated that these issues do not
need to imply that stylometry, when applied cau-
tiously, cannot yield valid research results in the
field of medieval philology.
First we showed that authorial discrimination
was possible in the corpus studied. Although sam-
ples had to be big enough to yield correct attribu-
tions, stylometric methods were generally able to
model the overall differences in writing style. This
suggests that superficial interference from scribes
(or even later editors) can be by-passed to a certain
extent, for instance through lemmatization.
Interestingly, we obtained satisfying results with a
word-level approach, notwithstanding the fact that
Latin is a highly inflected language. Although other
strategies might increase attribution accuracies in
the future, this shows that even in highly inflected

Collaborative authorship in the twelfth century
Literary and Linguistic Computing, 2013 21 of 26
languages, plenty of stylistic information can already
be harvested at the word-level.
In the course of our research, we have also
touched on collaborative authorship, an issue that
recently has raised considerable interest in stylom-
etry (Reynolds et al., 2012). Our methodology
enabled us to discover clear stylistic differences in
Hildegard of Bingen’s epistolary work between those
letters for which she had relied on the modest as-
sistance of her first collaborator Volmar and the
letters that have been compiled and copy-edited
by Guibert of Gembloux. Interestingly, the letter
samples influenced by the collaboration between
Hildegard and Guibert formed an isolated cluster
that did not display advanced stylistic similarities
to Hildegard’s former epistolary oeuvre, nor to
that of Guibert. These results argue in favor of
what Pennebaker (2011) has called the Synergy
Hypothesis: when two authors are involved in the
same texts, the end result need not resemble
the writing style of one of the two individually;
the result might rather resemble that of a ‘new’,
third author. The evidence offered in this particular
case study is valuable in this light, but at the same
time still too scant to come to a final verdict on this
fascinating topic.
Finally, with respect to our initial research ques-
tion, we hope to have convincingly disputed the
authorship of two texts allegedly attributed to
Hildegard: the Visio de Sancto Martino and the
Visio ad Guibertum missa. We argued that these vi-
sions are stylistically speaking completely in line
with the writing style of Guibert de Gembloux,
Hildegard’s last secretary. These results offer

quantitative support to suspicions voiced in earlier,
traditional philological research: if Guibert is not to
be considered their original author altogether, it is
clear that he reworked these texts so profoundly that
hardly anything of Hildegard’s writing style is still
discernible in them. In fact, it is noteworthy that our
analyses could not offer any stylistic evidence at all
that Hildegard once authored (even a preliminary
or simply oral version of) these texts, although this
remains of course an interesting historical
possibility.

Notes
1. Among the letters written with the help of Volmar, we
count those in MS Wien, Österreichische Nationalbi-
bliothek, 963 (theol. 348), which offers a copy of a
collection compiled by Volmar before 1173 (Van
Acker, 1991, p. XXVI), and the limited number of letters
that can be found distributed over MS Stuttgart, Würt-
tembergische Landesbibliothek, Cod. theol. phil. 48
253; MS Wien, Österreichische Nationalbibliothek,
881; MS Berlin, Staatsbibliothek Preussischer Kultur-
besitz, Cod. theol. lat. fol. 699; MS London, British
Library, Cod. Add. 17292; MS Paris, Bibliothèque
Nationale, Nouv. Acquis. Lat. 760; MS Trier, Stadtbi-
bliothek, Cod. 771/1350 and MS Kynžvart, Cod. 40.
Among the letters compiled and edited under Guibert’s
supervision, we count those in the Riesenkodex Wies-
baden, Landesbibliothek, 2 (dating from 1177-1179/
1180), that are not also found in MS Wien, Österrei-
chische Nationalbibliothek, 963 (theol. 348) (Van
Acker, 1991, p. XXVII), as well as those copied in MS
Berlin, Staatsbibliothek Preussischer Kulturbesitz, Cod.
lat. 48 674, which bear traces of Guibert’s editorial as-
sistance (Klaes, 2001, p. XVII). Among the letters con-
tained in the latter group, compiled under Guibert’s
supervision, we obviously encounter all Hildegard’s
letters addressed to Guibert and the ones that have
been written in the years in which he stayed in
Rupertsberg.
2. MSS Brussels, Royal Library, 5397–5407 and 5527–
5534 (both originating from Gembloux, early thir-
teenth century) and MS Brussels, Royal Library,
1510–1519 (originating from Sint-Maartensdal near
Louvain, fifteenth century).
3. See www.brepolis.net. The critical editions of the works
of both Hildegard of Bingen and Guibert of Gembloux
are published in several volumes in Brepols’s own
Corpus Christianorum series. For the works of
Bernardus, the Brepols Library of Latin Texts relies
on Leclercq et al. (1957–1977).
4. Bernard’s letters, edited by Leclercq and Rochais
(1974–1977), contain the ‘official’ epistolarium,
Collaborative authorship in the twelfth century
Literary and Linguistic Computing, 2013 25 of 26
compiled shortly after Bernard’s death, as well as letters
transmitted elsewhere. Guibert’s letters were edited by
Derolez (1988–1989) on the basis of MS Brussels,
Royal Library, 5527–5534.
5. See note 1. Hildegard’s letters are edited by Van Acker
(1991–1993) and by Klaes (2001)
6. We supplemented this list with three words—plerum-
que, utrumque, and quicumque—yet did not allow any
of these items into the restrictive set of function words
we list below. We did not consider other, much less
frequent clitics (e.g. –ne (‘if’) or –ve/ue (‘or’)), because
it is difficult to automatically detect these using a
simple rule-based approach and to distinguish them
from e.g. the –ne in deuotione or the –ue in serue.
7. We have described our approach in a generic way for
future reference. It should be noted, however, that
there still remains a small number of possible spelling
variants in medieval Latin that are hard to deal
with but that were not relevant for the present research
because we worked with critical editions that have
already normalized orthography to a large extent.
One can think here of the interchangeability
of –mqu– and –nqu– in some words and the problem
of single/double consonants (as e.g. in litera and lit-
tera). A lesser frequent, yet still important,
orthographical variant that we leave unaddressed is
(–)exs– versus ()ex–, because it is difficult to auto-
matically detect it using a rule-based approach.
Nevertheless, this variant hardly affects any of the func-
tion words to which we have restricted our analyses.
8. In these training data too, we have substituted all vs
for us and all aes/oes for es.
9. Note that licet, which strictly speaking derives from
the impersonal verb licere, is considered a function
word because it is primarily used as a subordinating
concessive conjunction.
10. Other errors in the lemmatization displayed in
Table 3 are ‘hildegars’, ‘us’, and ‘ta’.
11. Note that from this point onwards, we will express
the size of textual samples in terms of the number of
consecutive lemmatized words they contain (a
number which, after tokenization, need not be iden-
tical to the original number of surface forms in the
original texts).
12 For the sake of conceptual clarity we shall keep
Pennebaker’s original terminology, although it
should be stressed that our present use of the term
‘Synergy Hypothesis’ is completely unrelated to the
concept of ‘Synergetic Linguistics’ in the field of quan-
titative linguistics (Köhler, 2005).
