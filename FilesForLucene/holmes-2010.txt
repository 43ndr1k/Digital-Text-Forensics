Abstract
Of all American literary mysteries The Diary of a Public Man has been perhaps the
most perplexing. Set principally in Washington DC, it covers a short but critical
period in the nation’s history, the secession winter of 1860–61. The Diary entries
are dated during the last months of James Buchanan’s ill-fated administration
and the first 2 weeks after Abraham Lincoln’s inauguration. The publisher refused
to name the author yet, despite the Diary’s anonymity, it has been used and
quoted by historians for more than a century. It is clearly the work of an excep-
tionally gifted writer. The Diarist pictures himself as a strong Union man, much
worried whether the crisis can be resolved without resort to war. Naturally there
has been much speculation as to the Diary’s authorship. This article describes
how traditional and non-traditional methods of authorship attribution may be
employed on the Diary, which we believe to have been written by William Henry
Hurlbert. We argue that the joint interdisciplinary approach employed in this
article should be the way in which attributional research is conducted.
Information on the traditional attribution section of this article is adapted
from the forthcoming book by Daniel W. Crofts, A Secession Crisis Enigma:
William Henry Hurlbert and ‘The Diary of a Public Man’ (Louisiana University
Press, 2010)

1 Introduction
In 1879 the North American Review published four
separate monthly installments of The Diary of a
Public Man. The purported Diary attracted wide
interest. Although the editor concealed the diarist’s
identity and deleted the names of some of the per-
sons he mentioned, the document amply fulfilled
the editor’s promise to shed light on the ‘dark and
troubling times’ during the months before the
start of the American Civil War (Anonymous,
1879, introduction; Crofts, 2010, appendix). The
Diary appeared to offer verbatim accounts of
behind-the-scenes discussions at the very highest
levels during the greatest crisis the country had
ever faced.
The diarist’s glimpses of several key principals,
most notably Abraham Lincoln, have often re-
appeared in the writings of historians. On three oc-
casions, the diarist reported having met directly
with Lincoln, and he gathered additional second-
hand reports of other conversations with him. All
of these episodes took place during the weeks and
days immediately before and after inauguration day,

4 March 1861, a time of extraordinary importance.
In late February and early March peace hung by a
thread, as the new President confronted the terrible
reality that seven states in the Deep South had
begun to form a separate government. The diarist
provided memorable details of his encounters with
Lincoln. He detected ‘something almost woman-like
in the look of his [Lincoln’s] eyes’ and thought him
‘the most ill-favored son of Adam I ever saw’. On
the other hand, the diarist noted the ‘quaint and
rather forcible way’ that Lincoln expressed himself,
often using a homely analogue or telling a little story
to make a point (Anonymous, 1879, entries for
20 February, 4, 7 March 1861).
The diarist had access to many others besides
Lincoln. He reported meeting with a wide spectrum
of key officials, from the South as well as from the
North. The first Diary entry, dated 28 December
1860, recounted a ‘long conversation’ with James
L. Orr, once a Speaker of the US House of
Representatives and then a Commissioner from
South Carolina, who impressed the diarist as ‘hon-
estly trying to make the best of what he felt to be a
wretched business, and that at heart he was as good
a Union man as anybody in Connecticut or New
York’. The diarist was also close to Senator Judah
P. Benjamin of Louisiana, whom he considered
blessed with ‘a rare and lucid intelligence’ and ‘alert-
ness and accuracy of mind’, but deficient in ‘con-
sistency of purpose and strength of will’. The same
diarist who was in direct touch with Southern
luminaries and disinclined to assign them full
blame for the crisis also knew their polar opposite,
Charles Sumner, the Republican senator from
Massachusetts, who was a living symbol of
Northern contempt for the slave system and its de-
fenders. Although the diarist ‘never affected an ad-
miration’ for Sumner, the latter allegedly sought
him out in hopes of using his presumed influence
with Lincoln (Anonymous, 1879, entries for
28 December 1860, 13 January, 3 March 1861).
Even the most casual reader will find the Diary
accessible and the narrative lively. The diarist had an
uncommon knack for capturing quickly the essence
of a situation. His account is punctuated with
embedded quotations that convey immediacy.
Occasionally, the Diary’s daily entries record only
a single significant conversation or episode. More
often than not, however, the diarist summarizes
conversations with several persons, frequently punc-
tuated by his own reactions, opinions, or observa-
tions. He reports encountering people on the street,
staying out late, receiving mail, and being ‘called out
by a card’ from a visitor. The entries unfold as the
diarist recalls the events of the day. In some entries
the diarist almost talks to himself—he heard a story
‘so characteristic of all the persons so concerned in
it that I must jot it down’. The Diary therefore reads
like a diary (Anonymous, 1879, entries for 25, 26
February, 3, 4, 9 March 1861).
From the Diary’s first publication in 1879 until
the late 1940s, most historians considered it authen-
tic. They kept trying to identify the author, thereby
continuing a chase that began the moment it first
appeared, and they were baffled by their inability to
pinpoint anyone. A few harboured doubts about the
Diary, but leading scholars of the late nineteenth
and early 20th centuries such as James Ford
Rhodes, Frederic Bancroft, and Allen Johnson each
made use of it. Bancroft and Rhodes corresponded
with each other about the diarist’s possible identity.
‘I hope that we can yet solve this mystery’, Bancroft
wrote to Rhodes in 1896, ‘for, I do not believe the
diary was bogus’ (Bancroft, 1896). Many of their
successors of the 1930s and 1940s—most notably,
David M. Potter, Allan Nevins, and Roy Franklin
Nichols—also incorporated information from the
Diary in their books. Potter quipped in 1942 that
historians always quoted the Public Man’s ‘lively
passages’, even when they questioned his existence
(Potter, 1942, p. 385).
In 1948, however, Frank Maloy Anderson (1871–
1961) published The Mystery of ‘A Public Man’:
A Historical Detective Story (Anderson, 1948). His
book posed the two key questions regarding this
remarkable document—who was this diarist? Was
the diary genuine? Anderson’s conclusions were
buttressed by two decades of historical detective
work. After Anderson’s death, his research materials
were deposited in the Library of Congress, thereby
making it possible to examine the evidence and his
assessment of it.
Anderson concluded that the author was Samuel
Ward (1814–84), a talented and cosmopolitan

New Yorker, the brother of Julia Ward Howe (‘Battle
Hymn of the Republic’). Ward was best remembered
for his emergence after the war as a uniquely suc-
cessful Washington insider, ‘The King of the Lobby’.
Anderson explained that he fixed upon Ward by
specifying a number of key characteristics the diarist
must possess, and by finding that Ward matched the
criteria far better than any other possible diarist. The
author had to be someone who was resident in
Washington during the secession winter, who
enjoyed ‘extensive personal acquaintance’ with pol-
itical leaders there and had ‘considerable knowledge
[of] and interest in politics’, but who was not himself
someone with strong partisan affiliations. He must
also be someone of ‘wide experience’ who was well
informed about business affairs. He must either be ‘a
New Yorker’ or someone thoroughly acquainted
with prominent New Yorkers. On the key issue of
the day, the diarist must have ‘distrusted and feared
the influence of extremists on both sides of the crisis’
and had ‘a manifest preference for moderate men’.
In particular, he needed to be someone ‘who was
upon at least fairly intimate terms with [Secretary
of State William H.] Seward, for whom he had a
qualified admiration, and with [Illinois Senator
Stephen A.] Douglas, for whom his admiration was
in every respect deep and sincere’ (Anderson, 1948,
p. 140–61, quotations on 140–44).
Although satisfied that he had finally identified
the elusive diarist, Anderson concluded that the
Diary itself was a clever concoction rather than an
actual document:
It is not a genuine diary actually kept in 1860–
1861. It is, on the contrary, in part genuine
and in part fictitious. It includes as a core a
genuine diary, probably rather meager, actu-
ally kept by Sam Ward at Washington during
the Secession Winter of 1860–1861. Attached
to this genuine core there is a large amount of
embellishment added at a later date. This
added increment is in part recollection and
in part pure invention. The genuine core, the
recollection, and the invention have all been
skillfully blended with a polished literary style.
Consequently, Anderson concluded that the
diary ‘ought not to be regarded as a reliable
source in any of its details’ and it ‘ought not to be
regarded as history’. Its only redeeming value lay in
the ‘substantially accurate’ impression it conveyed
of the ‘confusion and uncertainty’ that enveloped
Washington during the secession winter
(Anderson, 1948, p. 169, 178).
2 ‘Traditional’ Attribution
Frank Maloy Anderson judged that Sam Ward must
have written The Diary of a Public Man. Anderson,
however, had little to say about writing style. How
does the Diary match up against prose written by
Ward? Does it contain patterns of word usage that
characterize Ward’s writing? Textual analysis tells a
different story than the one in Anderson’s book.
The most extensive prose venture Ward ever
undertook was a memoir of his experiences in the
California gold fields in 1851–52. Ward’s charming
and evocative recollections were published in four-
teen instalments in Porter’s Spirit of the Times, a
New York weekly, starting on 22 January 1861,
and concluding abruptly with the issue of 23 April
1861, just after the war began. The series ended be-
cause Ward departed for the seceded states in the
company of William H. Russell, the renowned cor-
respondent for the London Times (Collins, 1949).
For purposes of analysis, therefore, we have an
abundance of material that Ward wrote in early
1861. At precisely the same time the political crisis
reached its most acute phase, he was crafting ap-
proximately 4,000 words per week on an entirely
different subject. Do the Gold Rush memoir and
The Diary of a Public Man match up? Do they
read as if the same person wrote both? The answer
to this question is beyond dispute. Use of traditional
attributional tools of content and style shows that
these two documents could not have been written
by the same person.
It should be expected, of course, that the two
documents would have dissimilar features. One is
a purported Diary focused on elite level politics in
1861, even though it is now clear that the document
was composed later. The other is a memoir of events
that occurred almost a decade earlier, when Ward
rusticated for over a year with a memorably diverse

group of miners, speculators, Mexicans, and indi-
genous peoples at an Indian encampment or ‘ranch-
eria’ on the ‘River of Grace’, today’s Merced River,
which flows down from the high Sierras toward the
San Joaquin River and San Francisco Bay.
The differences between the two documents go
far beyond their radically different subject matter.
Ward’s memoir of the Gold Rush is awash with
words having a ‘-tion’ or ‘-ion’ suffix, yet 6 of the
10 most favoured of these words do not appear at all
in the Diary; three others are used but once; only
‘determination’ appears three times in the Diary.
His sentences sometimes meandered in a Baroque
manner. He had a habit of encasing unusual words
or phrases within quotation marks and peppering
his narrative with Spanish and French expressions.
By contrast, The Diary of a Public Man was written
by someone whose style featured active verbs
accompanied by adverbs with an ‘-ly’ suffix;
indeed seven ‘-ly’ words used in the Diary were ab-
solutely central to the diarist’s manner of written
expression. Four of these (‘really’, ‘perfectly’, ‘final-
ly’, and ‘frankly’) do not appear at all in the Gold
Rush memoir, which is twice the length of the
Diary; two are used once (‘certainly’ and ‘entirely’);
and one appears twice (‘apparently’). Hardly any of
the negatives used by the diarist appear in the
memoir; Ward encountered no ‘folly’ and nothing
that was ‘wild’, ‘horrible’, ‘worse’, or ‘worst’, and
but single instances each of ‘mischief’ and ‘wretch-
edness’. Ward did not precede his infrequent ‘-ly’
adverbs with the word ‘pretty’, as was the diarist’s
habit. The diarist, unlike the memoir writer, found
nothing ‘mournful’. Both writers alliterated, and
both used the words ‘particularly’, ‘attention’, ‘de-
termination’, and ‘anxiety’, but each otherwise had
his own distinct inventory of favourite words, and
the differences far outweigh the similarities. The
Diary is fast paced and immediate. The diarist,
who supposedly recorded exchanges that took
place that same day, more often provided the
words from a conversation than did Ward’s
California memoir.
If the Diary and the memoir on the Gold Rush
were not written by the same person, who besides
Ward might fit Anderson’s criteria for the diarist?
This brings us to William Henry Hurlbert (1827–95),
a gifted journalist and unconventional genius who
covered his tracks so well that his role has been
unrecognized until now. Hurlbert wrote with flair
and found that he could make a good living with his
pen. He became the chief editorial writer for the
New York Times in 1857. By the time of the seces-
sion winter, however, Hurlbert and the Times had
parted ways. Hurlbert moved to the New York World
in 1862 and for 7 years starting in 1876 he became
its editor-in-chief. At the World he brought his
forceful, fluid writing style to bear on a wide
range of topics—politics, international affairs, his-
tory, and literature.
Anderson knew that Ward and Hurlbert were
close friends, and he recognized that ‘the literary
style of the Diary has a good deal of the pungency
characteristic of almost everything that Hurlbert
wrote’. He also surmised that the published
Diary had been ‘skilfully blended’ by someone
with ‘a polished literary style’. The only role that
Anderson could imagine for Hurlbert, however,
was that of a possible collaborator, someone
who might have helped enlarge Ward’s ‘genuine
core’ that dated to 1861. Hurlbert’s ‘lively imagin-
ation’ could have ‘been equal to the task of supply-
ing inventions so plausible that they could pass
for historical facts’ (Anderson, 1948, p. 134–35,
169–70). Anderson was on the right track. He
sensed that Hurlbert had applied his skills to the
task at hand. He also knew that the finished docu-
ment held together well. Rather than being episodic
and fragmentary, as might be expected of a compos-
ite that had been cut and pasted together, it was
strikingly coherent. Indeed, Anderson finally con-
cluded that it was too good to be true. But he re-
sisted the conclusion that we have reached in this
attributional study, namely that Hurlbert wrote
every word published in 1879. Whatever sources
Hurlbert used to create it, the Diary was his work
alone.
The Diary abounds with striking parallels to
Hurlbert’s distinctive writing style, some of which
trace back to his very first years as a writer. His book
about a trip to Cuba, published in 1854, made
repeated use of key words that appear in the
Diary—‘wild’, ‘absurd’, ‘wretched’, ‘execrable’, and
‘sedulously’, and it included frequent alliteration

(Hurlbert, 1854, p. 53, 56, 70, 83, 116, 119, 133,
167). His essay for the Edinburgh Review in 1856
included a number of the Diary’s signature
words—‘certainly’, ‘singular’, ‘singularly’, ‘absurd’,
‘earnest’, and ‘earnestly’ (Hurlbert, 1856).
Hurlbert’s editorials for the New York Times, written
between October and December 1859, repeatedly
anticipate patterns of usage that appear in the
Diary. The editorialist leaned on words such as ‘en-
tirely’, ‘certainly’, ‘perfectly’, ‘apparently’, ‘espe-
cially’, ‘sedulously’, ‘earnestly’, and ‘clearly’, all of
which appear in the Diary and most of which
stand out there. Both editorialist and diarist also
employed ‘deplorable’, ‘mischief’, ‘scheme’, ‘wild’
and ‘wilder’, ‘absurd’, ‘angry and agitated’, ‘as-
tounding and alarming’, ‘dangerous and deplor-
able’, ‘dread and deprecate’, ‘dissolution and
dishonor’—the list could be stretched to great
length (Hurlbert, 1859).
As Hurlbert’s career unfolded, he continued to
write in ways that exhibit stylistic overlap with the
Diary. When he escaped from Confederate captivity
in August 1862, he described his experiences in a
series of seven articles for the New York Times.
These articles dovetail nicely with the Diary: both
employ less than routine words such as ‘forbear’,
‘ascertained’, ‘wildest’, ‘horrible’, ‘madness’,
‘wretched’, ‘pretensions’, and ‘peremptorily’; both
include a great many words that begin with
‘dis-’and ‘in-’(Hurlbert, 1862). Writing editorials
for the New York World in 1868, Hurlbert con-
demned the ‘preposterous proceedings’ of impeach-
ment, castigated Republicans for heating ‘the
cauldron of public passions’ and acting in ‘hot
and headlong haste’, and predicted that their ‘revo-
lutionary recklessness’ would lead to ‘defeat and
disgrace’(Hurlbert, 1868). In his 1874 editorials in
defence of Henry Ward Beecher, Hurlbert com-
plained that much of the evidence in the ‘wretched
business’ was ‘mischievous’ and ‘absurd’. It was
‘perfectly plain’ that the famous preacher had been
‘driven half mad’ by ‘moral scavengers’ who were
‘daily darkening’ the skies with ‘new clouds of filth’,
and who deserved ‘condign chastisement’ for their
‘wild, irresponsible’ accusations (Hurlbert, 1874).
In 1888 Hurlbert published a long account of
his travels through Ireland. Its word usage echoes
Public Man: ‘quaint’, ‘mischief’, ‘disagreeable’,
‘absurd’, ‘ascertained’, ‘wildest’, ‘peremptorily’, ‘dis-
quieted’, and ‘intimated’. Hurlbert’s alliterations
persisted: ‘friendly financiers’, ‘rattled rapidly’, ‘ex-
ultingly exclaimed’, ‘utterly unlike’ and so on
(Hurlbert, 1888).
Hurlbert’s writing style included many elem-
ents—an inventory of distinctive words, a fondness
for vigourous verbs and certain ‘-ly’ adverbs, a pro-
pensity for alliteration, and an uncanny ability to
draw in the reader. Together these features provide
the basis for ‘traditional’ attribution. None of the
component elements alone would point to Hurlbert,
but when combined together they are mutually rein-
forcing. Suddenly, the reader hears Hurlbert’s
unique voice. Traditional attribution, in the end,
is more an art than a science.
Some of the contents of the Diary also point to
Hurlbert rather than Ward. Twice the diarist men-
tioned Josiah Quincy (1772–1864), the retired
President of Harvard College. Quincy was a living
link between the New England Federalists who
complained that the Louisiana Purchase opened
the door to the expansion of slavery, and the
New Englanders of the 1850s who reacted viscerally
against the Fugitive Slave Law, the Kansas–Nebraska
Act, and the resultant spectacle of ‘Bleeding Kansas’.
During the mid-1850s, when Hurlbert’s own
outlook on public affairs became most
pro-Northern, he held the elderly ex-Federalist in
high regard (Anonymous, 1879, entries for 28 Dec
1860, 4 Mar 1861; Hurlbert, 1856, p. 561, 568–69,
574–76).
The Public Man referred to others who would
have been more familiar to Hurlbert than to
Ward. During 1859 and 1860, Stephen A. Douglas
enlisted several people to promote his presidential
candidacy. Among them was George N. Sanders, a
Kentucky native who was energetic, enthusiastic—
and uncontrollable. Hurlbert and Sanders collabo-
rated unsuccessfully to make the New York Times a
Douglas paper. Following the election, however, the
unpredictable Sanders became ‘a loud and noisy se-
cessionist’, thereby earning a dismissive barb in the
Diary. Far more than Ward, Hurlbert had reason to
notice—and to ridicule—Sanders’ erratic course
(Anonymous, 1879, entry for 28 Feb 1861).

The diarist had a higher estimate of another in-
sider from the Douglas campaign. John Forsyth,
editor of the Mobile Register, was among the most
outspoken champions of Douglas in the Deep
South. The diarist claimed to have received a letter
from Forsyth, before his arrival at the capital. The
Forsyth reference, like the Sanders one, points to
Hurlbert rather than Ward. Hurlbert hobnobbed
with those who were close to Douglas; Ward did
not (Anonymous, 1879, entry for 4 Mar 1861). One
episode in the Diary reads very much as if it is about
Ward, rather than by him. On 3 March the diarist
encountered an ‘anxious’ visitor who had been en-
listed by Seward to telegraph Jefferson Davis predict-
ing that Lincoln’s inaugural message ‘would be
conciliatory’. External evidence suggests that this
was Ward (Anonymous, 1879, entry for 3 Mar 1861).
Anderson thought that the Diary ended abruptly
on 15 March 1861 because that was when Ward
must have left Washington, but here Anderson
tried to have it both ways: he wanted the Diary
that was not a diary to reflect Ward’s movements
(Anderson, 1948, p. 162). There are, however, even
more powerful reasons why the Diary’s author
needed to end the document when he did. By
15 March it was generally assumed that Fort
Sumter in Charleston Harbour soon would be re-
linquished. A few days after, though, doubts and
questions began to arise. Perhaps the assumed deci-
sion had not been made after all? Perhaps the sigh of
relief breathed by all who hoped for a peaceful reso-
lution to the crisis was premature? Hurlbert, the
dramatic stylist, initiated the Diary with the
late-December flurry about Major Robert
Anderson’s move of his garrison from Fort
Moultrie on Sullivan’s Island to Fort Sumter. He
ended the Diary at just the point when the Sumter
difficulty supposedly had been resolved (Crofts,
1989, p. 289–90).
Anderson’s judgment about the reliability of the
Diary also must be qualified. It is now apparent that
the Diary was created from scratch by a person who
could not have been a legitimate diarist. It is, in fact,
a memoir rather than a genuine diary. It was com-
posed after the fact, not in 1861. The alleged diarist
was a fictional construct—no such person ever
existed. The Diary nonetheless was rooted in reality.
Plenty of its inside information meets the historical
test. Hurlbert wrote confidently about many matters
that had remained secret at the time the Diary ap-
peared, and that have since been authenticated. The
Diary therefore must be taken seriously despite its
seeming disqualifications (Crofts, 2010, p. 1–5).
Traditional attribution shows that the Diary’s
words reflect specific choices and patterns that
were characteristic of Hurlbert’s writing and entirely
unlike Ward’s. For an alternative and objective
statistical analysis, we turned to the science of
stylometry.
3 ‘Non-traditional’ Attribution:
Stylometry
3.1 Sampling and textual preparation
The stylometric task facing us was to examine the
Diary and attribute it. As we have seen above, the
contending authors are Samuel Ward and William
Henry Hurlbert but two more possible authors were
thrown into the stylometric mix: Henry Adams
(1838–1918), the grandson and great-grandson of
John Quincy and John Adams, and suggested as
the diarist by Benjamin Price (1955); and James E.
Harvey, one of the elite journalists of the antebellum
era, who wrote for several different newspapers,
including the Philadelphia North American and the
New York Tribune. Other contenders—Allen
Thorndike Rice, Thurlow Weed, James C. Welling,
Richard Grant White and John W. Forney—were
also investigated earlier in this research program,
tested using computational methods, but were
quickly rejected for statistical reasons as being
unlike the Diary. These early contenders will not
be discussed here.
A number of control texts are also necessary, in
the same genre and preferably of the same era.
Ideally, controls should be contemporary writers
who do not feature as contenders to the disputed
work. Accordingly, textual material from the letters
and diaries of the following three people was put
into machine-readable form for the analysis:
(1) Salmon Portland Chase (1808–73), who
became one of the first Republicans elected
to high office as governor of Ohio in 1855.

He failed to win the Republican presidential
nomination in 1860, but was soon appointed
Lincoln’s Secretary of the Treasury (1861–64)
and then as Chief Justice of the US Supreme
Court (1864–73).
(2) George Templeton Strong (1820–75), whose
voluminous diary published in four volumes
in 1952 is full of pithy opinions and insights,
and is the key to his posthumous reputation.
He admired Lincoln, supported the Union
war effort, and served on the US Sanitary
Commission.
(3) Gideon Welles (1802–78), founder and editor
of the Hartford Times. He was appointed
Secretary of the Navy in 1861 by Lincoln
and served until 1869. During his tenure in
that office he kept a diary, which was pub-
lished in three volumes in 1911.
Three textual samples, each of about 3,000
words, were taken from volume 1 of The Salmon
P. Chase Papers 1829-1872 (1993), from The Diary
of George Templeton Strong and from volume 1 of
the Diary of Gideon Welles.
For the two ‘long-shot’ contenders, five
3,000-word samples were taken from the volume
The Letters of Henry Adams 1858-1868 (1983) and
three smaller samples from James Harvey’s articles
in the Philadelphia North American and United
States Gazette, all written in 1860 and 1861. For
our two main candidates the choices of source ma-
terial were clear, given that we should control for
genre. Three 3,000-word samples were taken from
Sam Ward in the Gold Rush (1949) and three simi-
larly sized textual samples from Hurlbert’s travel-
ogue Ireland Under Coercion: The Diary of an
American (1888). Finally, for The Diary of a Public
Man itself, four textual samples each of approxi-
mately 3,000 words, representing in total about
two-fifth of the work, were taken at various places
throughout the diary, being sufficiently spaced to
enable a valid check to be made on internal
consistency.
All these samples are listed in Table 1, the sam-
ples being either typed or scanned into machine-
readable form. The choice of text size in stylometric
studies is always problematic. Smaller text units are
too short to provide opportunities for stylistic
habits to operate on the arrangement of internal
constituents, while larger units are insufficiently fre-
quent to provide enough examples for reliable stat-
istical inference. In their study of the Book of
Mormon, Jockers et al. (2008) claim that even the
smallest chapters are of adequate size for stylometric
analysis, finding no correlation between the correct
assignment of an author and the length of text
sample. Forsyth and Holmes (1996) found the
median text block size in a selection of stylometric
studies to be around 3,500 words. The target length
for this investigation was accordingly set at
3,000 words per sample but in the case of James
Harvey we could only collect 1,400 words per
sample. In all the analyses, the occurrence rates of
words are measured in ‘rates per thousand’. Thus
for this study, differences in sample sizes are not
critical provided we adhere to a stylometrically de-
sirable minimum threshold of 1,000 words.
3.2 Stylometric methodology
In a pioneering work first published in 1964,
Mosteller and Wallace employed frequencies of
function words such as prepositions, conjunctions
and articles as discriminators to investigate the mys-
tery of the authorship of the Federalist Papers. Their
scholarly analysis opened the way to the modern,
computerized age of stylometry. The use of
non-contextual high-frequency functions words as
tools in attributional problems was continued by
J. F. Burrows (1992) and since then multivariate
statistical analyses involving large sets (50–100) of
such words have met with astonishing success. Some
noteworthy examples in a wide array of authors and
genres have been the attribution of the 1583
Consolatio, shown to be not a lost work of Cicero
but a 16th-century forgery (Forsyth et al., 1999), the
investigation into the authorship of the so-called
‘Pickett Letters’ of the American Civil War
(Holmes et al., 2001b), and the new look at the
authorship of the Book of Mormon (Jockers et al.,
2008). The ‘Burrows’ approach essentially picks the
N most common words in the corpus under inves-
tigation and computes the occurrence rate of these
N words in each text or text-unit, thus converting
each text into an N-dimensional array of numbers.
Multivariate statistical techniques, most commonly

principal components analysis and cluster analysis,
are then applied to the data to look for patterns. The
former aims to reduce the dimensionality of the
problem by transforming the N variables to a smal-
ler number (usually 2) of new variables and the
latter technique provides an independent and ob-
jective view of any groupings amongst the textual
samples by means of a tree-diagram or dendrogram.
The ‘Burrows’ approach has become the first
port-of-call for attributional problems and will be
the initial technique adopted in this investigation.
The value of N used varies by application and
genre but typically lies between 50 and 75, the im-
plication being that these words should be among
the most common in the language and that content
words should be avoided. Attributional studies have
achieved success with N set at 50 (Holmes and
Forsyth, 1995; Holmes, Robertson and Paez,
2001a), so this value of N is used as a rule-of-thumb
heuristic throughout the analysis, being an appro-
priate value for these sized text samples. Future
work with this textual data set could, however, in-
clude a study of the effect of varying the value of
N. Appendix A lists these fifty most common func-
tion words, taken from the corpus of texts in
Table 1.
In 2002 Burrows published a new way of using
relative frequencies of common words for author-
ship attribution, naming his procedure ‘Delta’.
Burrows defines Delta to be ‘the mean of the abso-
lute differences between the z-scores for a set of
word-variables in a given text group and the
z-scores for the same set of word-variables in a
target text’. The primary text with the smallest
value of Delta, i.e. the smallest mean difference
from the test text, is ‘least unlike’ it and the
author of that primary text has the best claim,
among the authors tested, to be the author of the

test text. Delta has been subjected to extensive test-
ing by Hoover (2004a) and was used by Jockers et al.
in their study of Mormon scripture. Delta is becom-
ing an important tool for stylometrists and is used
in this study.
In a separate paper, Hoover (2004b) looked at
alternatives or variants to Delta and showed that
several variants were equally as effective as the ori-
ginal Delta in non-traditional attribution. His excel-
lent results with these variants encouraged us to use
them, also, in this investigation.
3.3 Hierarchy of analyses
3.3.1 Controls: Chase, Strong, and Welles
The first phase in this investigation was designed to
test the validity of the proposed technique. For the
purposes of this study, it is required that known
texts can be shown to be internally consistent and
separate from each other. The occurrence rates of
the fifty words listed in Appendix A were computed
for the individual textual samples from the diaries
and papers of Chase, Strong, and Welles and used as
input to both a principal components analysis and a
cluster analysis. The positions of the samples in the
space of the first two principal components, which
together explain 55.1% of the variation in the ori-
ginal data, are shown in Fig. 1. An alternative ana-
lysis of the controls may be provided by conducting
a cluster analysis on the textual samples, using the
fifty word rates as variables and average linkage as
the clustering algorithm. Figure 2 shows the result-
ing dendrogram.
Our results with these two methods of analysis
are mutually supportive, with samples forming clus-
ters on the basis of authorship. Our writers are in-
ternally consistent as regards their usage of these
fifty words, yet are distinguishable from each other.
3.3.2 Controls: Adams, Harvey, and Ward
We now turn to three candidate authors of the
Diary, albeit still in the ‘control’ mode of testing
the validity of the ‘Burrows’ approach on textual
samples from known writers. This time we will con-
sider Samuel Ward, Henry Adams, and James
Harvey. The occurrence rates of the 50 most fre-
quently occurring function words were once again
used as input to both a principal components ana-
lysis and a cluster analysis. The positions of the sam-
ples in the space of the first two principal
components, which together explain 63.9% of the
variation in the original data, are shown in Fig. 3.
An alternative analysis of the controls was provided
by conducting a cluster analysis on the textual sam-
ples, using the fifty word rates as variables. Figure 4
shows the resulting dendrogram.
Both our plots show quite remarkable internal
consistency along with clear differences between
Adams, Harvey and Ward on the basis of their use

of the function words. Once more the ‘Burrows’
approach has been validated on works of known
authors.
3.3.3 Adams, Harvey, Ward, and the Diary
Having successfully validated the technique on the
control samples, we may now incorporate the text-
ual samples from the Diary into the analysis.
Accordingly the next step was to add the Diary sam-
ples to the three candidate authors in (b) above.
Once more the occurrence rates of the fifty most
frequently occurring function words were used as
input to both a principal components analysis and
a cluster analysis. The positions of the samples in the
space of the first two principal components, which
together explain 52.7% of the variation in the ori-
ginal data, are shown in Fig. 5. The alternative ana-
lysis provided by conducting a cluster analysis on
the textual samples, using the 50 word rates as vari-
ables, revealed the dendrogram shown in Fig. 6.
Two important conclusions may be drawn from
these clear and mutually supportive plots. First, the
four Diary samples show excellent internal consist-
ency, suggesting single authorship. Secondly, the
Diary samples cluster quite distinctly and separately
from the samples of the writings of Adams, Harvey,

and Ward. Two of our possible contenders and one
of our strong contenders for authorship all now
appear not to match the author of the Diary accord-
ing to the ‘Burrows’ approach.
3.3.4 Ward and Hurlbert
The control samples have served their purpose and
it is now time to bring the Hurlbert samples into
the analysis. Leaving aside the Diary samples for the
moment, it will be interesting simply to match the
two main contenders Ward and Hurlbert against
each other. Using the ‘Burrows’ approach as in the
above analyses, Figs 7 and 8 show the principal
components plot and the dendrogram for the text-
ual samples from these writers. Both these support-
ing plots show that Ward’s and Hurlbert’s function
words differ in their rate of usage.
We may explore this separation by looking at
Fig. 9, the associated scaled loadings plot from the
principal components analysis, which helps to
explain the groupings in the main plot. One can
imagine superimposing this graph on top of the
principal components plot. Words on the right
such as ‘no’, ‘is’ and ‘be’ have high usage by

Hurlbert, whereas words on the left such as
‘with’, ‘which’ and ‘had’ are words favoured by
Ward.
Following the results from all our analyses, we
may now confidently proceed to the final stage of
the non-traditional attribution, namely comparing
the Diary solely with Ward and Hurlbert.
3.3.5 Attribution: Ward, Hurlbert and the Diary
For the attributional phase of this investigation we
turn to a third technique in multivariate statistical
analysis, namely discriminant analysis. Essentially,
this technique shows how well it is possible to sep-
arate two or more known groups of cases (samples),
given measurements on several variables for these
samples. The technique uses the known data to
derive one or more ‘discriminant functions’. These
functions are linear combinations of the variables
that best separate the known groups. The functions
are then tested against the known data to assess the
classification accuracy of the routine. Once the
functions have been tested, they may then be used

to classify cases for which the true group is not
known, the cases being assigned to the group that
they are ‘closest’ to in a multivariate sense.
Prior to the use of discriminant analysis, how-
ever, it would be instructive to conduct another
principal components analysis using our 50 words
and view the positions of the Ward, Hurlbert and
Diary samples in the space of the first two compo-
nents. Figure 10 shows this plot .
Projection onto the first, dominant, component
in Fig. 10 hints that Hurlbert may be ‘closer’ to the
Diary than Ward but we should note the low
percentage of variation explained (53.5%) by
looking at just two dimensions.
To use discriminant analysis, it is advisable not
to have more variables than cases. The Ward
samples were combined and then split into nine
new samples, each of approximately 1,000 words.
Similarly the Hurlbert samples were combined and
then subdivided into nine new samples, each of ap-
proximately 1,000 words. We thus have a total of
18 new samples, each of approximately the same
size, drawn from two known and distinctive
groups. The Diary samples were next combined

and subdivided into 12 new samples, each, once
more, of approximately 1,000 words. To run the
discriminant analysis procedure, the number of
variables was reduced to the thirty most frequently
occurring function words in the Ward–Hurlbert–
Diary corpus. These words are listed in Appendix B.
An initial, exploratory, look at the groupings of
our new samples may be obtained by looking at the
principal components plot of our new (30 30)
data matrix. Figure 11 shows this plot.
This plot, again, suggests that Hurlbert lies
‘closer’ to the Diary than Ward, but we need to
turn to discriminant analysis in an attempt to
resolve this question.
For a two-known-group analysis, one discrimin-
ant function is derived. Table 2 gives information
on the effectiveness of the discriminant analysis pro-
cedure on our known data. A test of the null hy-
pothesis that, in the populations from which the
samples are drawn, there is no difference between
the two group means is based on the Wilks’ Lambda
statistic. This hypothesis may be firmly rejected
(P< 0.0005) implying that the two style groups,
Ward and Hurlbert, are significantly different with
respect to the means of their discriminant scores.
Table 3 shows the 11 words which load most
heavily on the discriminant function.
It is instructive to now compare this table with
the loadings plot for Ward and Hurlbert shown in
Fig. 9. Highly positively loaded words from the dis-
criminant function such as ‘be’, ‘is’, ‘have’ and ‘it’
are all words which appear on the right (Hurlbert)
side of the loadings plot in Fig. 9, while highly nega-
tively loaded words such as ‘which’, ‘with’ and ‘had’
are words which appear on the left (Ward) side of
the loadings plot.
Another measure of the effectiveness of the clas-
sification routine is seen in the top half of the SPSS
classification matrix in Table 4. All 18 of our known
textual samples have been correctly classified into
their style groups, even with cross-validation—a
more rigorous classification algorithm where each
sample is, in turn, omitted, the discriminant func-
tion derived on the 17 remaining samples, then the
omitted sample allocated to its nearest style group.
The classification routine was then instructed to
assign the 12 samples from the Diary to the group
(style) they are closest to, in the sense of distance in
multivariate space. The lower half of the classifica-
tion matrix in Table 4 shows that all 12 of the Diary
samples have been placed in the Hurlbert style
group.
3.4 ‘Delta’ analysis
For an alternative non-traditional stylometric inves-
tigation into the authorship of the Diary, we turn to
Burrows’ Delta technique and the variants to Delta
introduced by Hoover, first discussed in section 3.2

above, and labelled Delta Prime. For this analysis,
four potential authors of the Diary are measured:
Ward, Adams, Harvey, and Hurlbert, and the pri-
mary samples formed by combining the samples
used for the earlier tests. Both Burrows (2002) and
Hoover (2004a) found that the accuracy of Delta
increases as the number of frequent words included
in an analysis rises from 40 to 150. Jockers et al.,
(2008) use 110 words in their Delta tests. Initially
we set the number of words at 50 but following
private correspondence with Burrows, it was
decided to use the top 100 most frequently occur-
ring function words for this analysis. Appendix A
lists the additional fifty words now added to the top
fifty used in the earlier analyses involving principal
components and clustering.
We now add a second corpus from William
Hurlbert. In addition to his travelogue Ireland
Under Coercion: The Diary of an American, now
labelled ‘Hurlbert 1’, Hurlbert wrote lengthy articles
for the New York Times which were published in
September and October 1862. These articles total
16,451 words and were added to the text corpus
used for Delta and Delta Prime analysis under the
label ‘Hurlbert 2’.
Table 5 below lists the Delta and Delta Prime
indices of ‘closeness’ between the Diary and the
candidate authors:
Values of Delta typically range from 0.5 to 1.5
(Hoover, 2004a). From this table we can see that the
lowest Delta score (0.7784) is that of Hurlbert; in
other words Hurlbert is ‘least unlike’ the Diary
author and has the best claim to be the true

second lowest Delta score (0.7854) is also from
Hurlbert—his New York Times articles. Thus, both
the text corpora from Hurlbert match the Diary
better than text from Ward, Adams, and Harvey.
The first variant of Delta, labelled Delta Prime
and introduced in detail by Hoover (2004b), also
suggests Hurlbert as author, with the lowest Delta
Prime score (1.3847) obtained on both Hurlbert
corpora. Hoover notes that this particular
re-definition of Delta produces results slightly
more accurate than those based on Delta itself.
The remaining three variants are simply transform-
ations of Delta Prime that weigh positive differences

more heavily than negative ones. Although there is
no theoretical basis for these transformations, and
one must expect them to be correlated, Hoover pre-
sents a powerful inductive basis for their employ-
ment. Both the Hurlbert 1 and Hurlbert 2 corpora
are of closer match to the Diary using Delta Prime
and its three transformations than Ward, Adams
and Harvey.
These remarkable and conclusive findings,
coupled with the evidence from the hierarchical
analyses in section 3.3 above, confirm that
non-traditional authorship attribution points very
strongly to William Hurlbert being the author of
the Diary.
4 Conclusion
The non-traditional analysis has supplied objective,
stylometric evidence that supports the traditional
scholarship on the authorship of the Diary. While,
in the absence of definitive external evidence,
no attributional claim can be absolute, some meth-
odologies will nevertheless be more reliable than
others. In blending a traditional approach to the
attribution of The Diary of a Public Man with a
non-traditional stylometric approach, we agree
with the viewpoint of Hänlein (1999), who argues
that the most reliable results in authorship recogni-
tion studies take into account both ‘intuitive’ find-
ings—i.e. the traditional scholar’s inherently
subjective recognition of an author’s distinctive
style—and computational methods. A sequential
approach to attribution is also recommended by
Rudman (1998), who stresses: ‘Any non-traditional
study should only be undertaken after an exhaustive
traditional study. The non-traditional is a tool for
the traditional authorship scholar, not a proving
ground for statisticians and others to test statistical
techniques’.
This joint interdisciplinary approach to a prob-
lem that has fascinated historians for over a century
concludes that William Hurlbert has the strongest
claim to be the true author of the Diary.
We recommend this stepwise procedure to other
researchers studying attribution problems.
