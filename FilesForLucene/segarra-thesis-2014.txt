Abstract
A method for identifying the author of a written text by using function word adjacency net-
works (WANs) is developed. Function words express grammatical relationships between
other words but do not carry meaning on their own. In the WANs, nodes are function words
and directed edges represent the likelihood of directed co appearance between two of these
words. For each candidate author, a profile WAN is constructed against which the WAN
of a text to attribute is compared. By reinterpreting WANs as Markov chains where the
state space corresponds to the set of function words, they can be compared in terms of rel-
ative entropies. Optimal selection of WAN parameters is studied and attribution accuracy
is benchmarked across a diverse pool of authors and varying text lengths. This analysis
shows that, since function words are independent of content, their use tends to be specific
to an author and that the relational data captured by function WANs is a good summary of
authorial style. Attribution accuracy is observed to exceed the one achieved by methods
that rely on word frequencies alone. Furthermore, combining WANs with methods that
rely on word frequencies, results in larger attribution accuracy, indicating that both sources
of information encode different aspects of stylometric fingerprints. In the second part of
this thesis, we use WANs to analyze authorial controversies among Shakespeare and his
contemporaries. After validating the accuracy of WANs in this dataset, we test existing hy-
pothesis about authors of anonymous texts and the partition among authors of collaborative
plays. Finally, the impact of genre on attribution accuracy is examined revealing that the
genre of a play partially conditions the choice of the function words used in it.

Chapter 1
Introduction
With the Sumerian invention of writing in ancient Mesopotamia over 5,000 years ago,
mankind achieved partial independence from oral communication. This implied that words
could be separated from their author in both space and time. This paradigm-shifting event
was key for the further development of human beings, allowing the spread of ideas, the
organization of society, the documentation of events and more. Furthermore, with written
language a new problem appeared: authorship attribution.
The discipline of authorship attribution is concerned with matching a text of unknown
or disputed authorship to one of a group of potential candidates. More generally, it can
be seen as a way of quantifying literary style or uncovering a stylometric fingerprint. The
most traditional application of authorship attribution is literary research, but it has also been
applied in forensics [1], defense intelligence [2] and plagiarism [3]. Both, the availability
of electronic texts and advances in computational power and information processing, have
1
2
boosted accuracy and interest in computer based authorship attribution methods [4–6].
Authorship attribution dates at least to more than a century ago with a work that pro-
posed distinguishing authors by looking at word lengths [7]. This was later improved
by [8] where the average length of sentences was considered as a determinant. A seminal
development was the introduction of the analysis of function words to characterize authors’
styles [9] which inspired the development of several methods. Function words are words
like prepositions, conjunctions, and pronouns which on their own carry little meaning but
dictate the grammatical relationships between words. The advantage of function words is
that they are content independent and, thus, can carry information about the author that is
not biased by the topic of the text being analyzed. Since [9], function words appeared in a
number of papers where the analysis of the frequency with which different words appear in
a text plays a central role one way or another; see e.g., [10–13]. Other attribution methods
include the stylometric techniques in [14], the use of vocabulary richness as a stylometric
marker [15–17] – see also [18] for a critique –, the use of stable words defined as those that
can be replaced by an equivalent [19], and syntactical markers such as taggers of parts of
speech [20]. Markov chains have also been used as a tool for authorship attribution [21,22].
However, the chains in these works represent transitions between letters, not words. Al-
though there is little intuitive reasoning behind the notion that an author’s style can be
modeled by his usage of individual letters, these approaches generate somewhat positive
results.
Our method for attributing texts also measures function word usage to distinguish au-
3
thor styles. Rather than only considering word frequencies, however, we consider a more
complex relational structure between an author’s usage of function words. The rest of the
thesis is organized as follows. We first provide a formal description of the problem of au-
thorship attribution and its variants (Chapter 2). The thesis is then divided into two parts:
the description of a method to solve authorship attribution problems (Chapters 3 to 7) and
the application of this method to attribute Early Modern English plays (Chapters 8 to 12).
In the first part of the thesis, we begin by describing word adjacency networks (WANs),
which are directed networks that store information of co-appearance of two function words
in the same sentence. With proper normalization, edges of these networks describe the like-
lihood that a particular function word is encountered in the text given that we encountered
another one. This implies that WANs can be reinterpreted as Markov chains describing
transition probabilities between function words. Given this interpretation it is natural to
measure the dissimilarity between different texts in terms of the relative entropy between
the associated Markov chains (Chapter 3). The classification accuracy of WANs depends
on various parameters regarding the generation of the WANs as well as the selection of
words chosen as network nodes. We consider the optimal selection of these parameters and
develop an adaptive strategy to pick the best network node set given the texts to attribute
(Chapter 4). We illustrate the implementation of our method and analyze the changes in
accuracy when modifying the number of candidate authors as well as the length of the texts
of known and unknown authorship and the similarity of styles between candidate authors
(Chapter 5). We then incorporate authors from the early 17th century to the corpus and
4
analyze how differences in time period, genre, and gender influence the classification rate
of WANs. We also show that WANs can be used to detect collaboration between several
authors (Chapter 6). We further demonstrate that our classifier performs better than tech-
niques based on function word frequencies alone. Perhaps more important, we show that
the stylometric information captured by WANs is not the same as the information cap-
tured by word frequencies. Consequently, their combination results in a further increase in
classification accuracy (Chapter 7). The results in this first part were published in [23, 24].
In the second part of the thesis, we begin by discussing the main playwrights analyzed
in our work and the construction of their profile networks as well as a measure of similarity
between profiles (Chapter 8). We then perform a stylometric analysis of the complete
canons of our five primary playwrights, followed by a summary of results that shows the
value of WANs to classify texts from that period (Chapter 9). An analysis of a set of
plays published anonymously or without a clear author is performed (Chapter 10). We
then examine the use of WANs in determining authorship of plays known to be written by
multiple authors in collaboration (Chapter 11). This is first done by analyzing entire plays
and then through extensive interplay analysis of a set of particularly controversial plays.
Our results largely corroborate existing theories regarding these plays as well as, in some
cases, propose new authorship breakdowns. We conclude by providing a brief analysis of
the use of WANs in distinguishing between the three most common dramatic genres of
the era: comedy, tragedy, and history (Chapter 12). The results in this second part were
published in [25].
Chapter 2
The Authorship Attribution Problem
Authorship attribution can be loosely described as the endeavor to extract the characteristics
of an author of a text. Although, this broad definition allows various interpretations, three
main problems in authorship attribution have been pointed out in the literature [5]. The
first problem type, called closed class, is where you are given a text which was written by
someone within a pool of candidate authors and you want to determine who the rightful
author is. The second problem type, called open class, is similar to the previous one but
there exists the possibility that the text does not belong to any of the candidate authors.
The third type, sometimes called profiling, deals with extracting extra information about
the author apart from his identity, e.g. gender or nationality. In the present work, we focus
our interest mainly in the closed class problem and present some results on author profiling
as well.
The closed class authorship attribution problem can be formally defined as follows. We
5
6
are given a set of n authorsA = {a1, a2, ..., an}, a set ofm known texts T = {t1, t2, ..., tm}
and a set of k unknown texts U = {u1, u2, ..., uk}. We are also given an authorship attribu-
tion function rT : T → A mapping every known text in T to its corresponding author in A,
i.e. rT (t) ∈ A is the author of text t for all t ∈ T . We further assume rT to be surjective,
this implies that for every author ai ∈ A there is at least one text tj ∈ T with rT (tj) = ai.
Denote as T (i) ⊂ T the subset of known texts written by author ai, i.e.
T (i) = {t | t ∈ T, rT (t) = ai}. (2.1)
According to the above discussion, it must be that |T (i)| > 0 for all i and {T (i)}ni=1 must be a
partition of T . In Chapter 3, we use the texts contained in T (i) to generate a relational profile
for author ai. There exists an unknown attribution function rU : U → Awhich assigns each
text u ∈ U to its actual author rU(u) ∈ A. Our objective is to approximate this unknown
function with an estimator r̂U built with the information provided by the attribution function
rT . Define the classification accuracy as the fraction of unknown texts that are correctly
attributed. With I denoting the indicator function we can write the classification accuracy
ρ as
ρ(r̂U) =
1
k
∑
u∈U
I {r̂U(u) = rU(u)} . (2.2)
Throughout this work, we use ρ(r̂U) to gauge performance when classifying a set of texts.
Notice that the described framework can be modified to accommodate the description
of the open class problem by adding an additional author a0 to the set A representing the
option of any author other than a1 through an. For this to be consistent, we should have
|T (0)| = 0, i.e. we have no sample text about this artificial author. Accuracy of the classifier
7
built can still be computed as in (2.2).
Author profiling can also be thought in terms of the closed problem formulation where
the set A contains author profiles instead of individual authors. For example, if we are
trying to infer the gender of an author, there are two possible profiles – male a1 and female
a2 – and the set T contains known texts written by authors of both genders and our task is
to decide if an unknown text u ∈ U was written by a man a1 or a woman a2.

Chapter 3
Function Word Adjacency Networks
In order to solve the authorship attribution problems formalized in the previous chapter, we
construct word adjacency networks (WANs) for the known texts t ∈ T and unknown texts
u ∈ U . We attribute texts by comparing the WANs of the unknown texts u ∈ U to the
WANs of the known texts t ∈ T .
In constructing WANs, the concepts of sentence, proximity, and function words are
important. Every text consists of a sequence of sentences, where a sentence is defined as
an indexed sequence of words between two stopper symbols. We think of these symbols as
grammatical sentence delimiters, but this is not required. For a given sentence, we define
a directed proximity between two words parametric on a discount factor α ∈ (0, 1) and
a window length D. If we denote as i(ω) the position of word ω within its sentence the
directed proximity d(ω1, ω2) from word ω1 to word ω2 when 0 < i(ω2) − i(ω1) ≤ D is
11

defined as
d(ω1, ω2) := α
i(ω2)−i(ω1)−1. (3.1)
In every sentence there are two kind of words: function and non-function words [26]. While
in (3.1) the words w1 and w2 need not be function words, in this work we are interested
only in the case in which both w1 and w2 are function words. Function words are words
that express primarily a grammatical relationship. These words include conjunctions (e.g.,
and, or), prepositions (e.g., in, at), quantifiers (e.g., some, all), modals (e.g., may, could),
and determiners (e.g., the, that). We exclude gender specific pronouns (he, she) as well
as pronouns that depend on narration type (I, you) from the set of function words to avoid
biased similarity between texts written using the same grammatical person. The 30 function
words that appear most often in our experiments are listed in Table 3.1. The concepts of
sentence, proximity, and function words are illustrated in the following example.
Example 1 Define the set of stopper symbols as {. ; }, let the parameter α = 0.8, the
window D = 4, and consider the text
“A swarm in May is worth a load of hay; a swarm in June is worth a silver spoon; but
a swarm in July is not worth a fly.”
The text is composed of three sentences separated by the delimiter { ; }. We then divide the
text into its three constituent sentences and highlight the function words
13
a swarm in May is worth a load of hay
a swarm in June is worth a silver spoon
but a swarm in July is not worth a fly
The directed proximity from the first a to swarm in the first sentence is α0 = 1 and the
directed proximity from the first a to in is α1 = 0.8. The directed proximity to worth or
load is 0 because the indices of these words differ in more than D = 4.
WANs are weighted and directed networks that contain function words as nodes. The
weight of a given edge represents the likelihood of finding the words connected by this
edge close to each other in the text. Formally, from a given text t we construct the network
Wt = (F,Qt) where F = {f1, f2, ..., ff} is the set of nodes composed by a collection
of function words common to all WANs being compared and Qt : F × F → R+ is a
similarity measure between pairs of nodes. Methods to select the elements of the node set
F are discussed in Chapter 4.
In order to calculate the similarity function Qt, we first divide the text t into sentences
sht where h ranges from 1 to the total number of sentences. We denote by s
h
t (e) the word in
the e-th position within sentence h of text t. In this way, we define
Qt(fi, fj) =
∑
h,e
I{sht (e) = fi}
D∑
d=1
αd−1 I{sht (e+ d) = fj}, (3.2)
for all fi, fj ∈ F , where α ∈ (0, 1) is the discount factor that decreases the assigned weight
as the words are found further apart from each other and D is the window limit to consider
that two words are related. The similarity measure in (3.2) is the sum of the directed
proximities from fi to fj defined in (3.1) for all appearances of fi when the words are found
14
at mostD positions apart in the same sentence. Since in generalQt(fi, fj) 6= Qt(fj, fi), the
WANs generated are directed. Notice that the function in (3.2) combines into one similarity
number the frequency of co-appearance of two words and the distance between these two
words in each appearance, making both effects indistinguishable.
Example 2 Consider the same text and parameters of Example 1. There are four function
words yielding the set F = {a, in, of, but}. The matrix representation of the similarity
function Qt is
Qt =

a in of but
a 0 3× 0.81 0.81 0
in 2× 0.83 0 0 0
of 0 0 0 0
but 1 0.82 0 0
. (3.3)
The total similarity value from a to in is obtained by summing up the three 0.81 proximity
values that appear in each sentence. Although the word a appears twice in every sentence,
Q(a, a) = 0 because its appearances are more than D = 4 words apart.
Using text WANs, we generate a network Wc for every author ac ∈ A as Wc = (F,Qc)
where
Qc =
∑
t∈T (c)
Qt. (3.4)
Similarities in Qc depend on the amount and length of the texts written by author ac. This
is undesirable since we want to be able to compare relational structures among different
authors. Hence, we normalize the similarity measures as
Q̂c(fi, fj) =
Qc(fi, fj)∑
kQc(fi, fk)
, (3.5)
15
for all fi, fj ∈ F . In this way, we achieve normalized networks P̂c = (F, Q̂c) for each
author ac. In (3.5) we assume that there is at least one positively weighted edge out of
every node fi so that we are not dividing by zero. If this is not the case for some function
word fi, we fix Q̂c(fi, fj) = 1/|F | for all fj .
Example 3 By applying normalization (3.5) to the similarity function in Example 2, we
obtain the following normalized similarity matrix
Q̂t =

a in of but
a 0 0.75 0.25 0
in 1 0 0 0
of 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25
but 0.61 0.39 0 0
. (3.6)
Similarity Q̂t no longer depends on the length of the text t but on the relative frequency of
the co-appearances of function words in the text.
Our claim is that every author ac has an inherent relational structure Pc that serves
as an authorial fingerprint and can be used towards the solution of authorship attribution
problems. P̂c = (F, Q̂c) estimates Pc with the available known texts written by author ac.
3.1 Network Similarity
The normalized networks P̂c can be interpreted as discrete time Markov chains (MC) since
the similarities out of every node sum up to 1. Thus, the normalized similarity between
words fi and fj is a measure of the probability of finding fj in the words following an
encounter of fi. In a similar manner, we can build a MC Pu for each unknown text u ∈ U .
16
Since every MC has the same state space F , we use the relative entropy H(P1, P2) as a
dissimilarity measure between the chains P1 and P2. The relative entropy is given by
H(P1, P2) =
∑
i,j
π(fi)P1(fi, fj) log
P1(fi, fj)
P2(fi, fj)
, (3.7)
where π is the limiting distribution of P1 and we consider 0 log 0 to be equal to 0. The
choice of H as a measure of dissimilarity is not arbitrary. In fact, if we denote as w1 a
realization of the MC P1, H(P1, P2) is proportional to the logarithm of the ratio between
the probability thatw1 is a realization of P1 and the probability thatw1 is a realization of P2.
In particular, when H(P1, P2) is null, the ratio is 1 meaning that a given realization of P1
has the same probability of being observed in both MCs [27]. Relative entropy (3.7), also
called Kullback-Leibler divergence rate [28], is a common dissimilarity measure among
Markov chains and is used in a variety of applications such as face recognition [29] and
gene analysis [30]. Notice that the limit distribution π in (3.7) retains some information
about the frequency of appearance of the function words. E.g., for the MC in Example
3, the highest limit probability π(a) = 0.44 is obtained for the most frequent word a
while the lowest limit probability π(but) = 0.04 is achieved by one of the two words that
appears only once in the text fragment in Example 1. We point out that relative entropy
measures have also been used to compare vectors with function word frequencies [31].
This is unrelated to their use here as measures of the relational information captured in
function WANs.
Using (3.7), we generate the attribution function r̂U(u) by assigning the text u to the
17
author with the most similar relational structure
r̂U(u) = ap, where p = argmin
c
H(Pu, P̂c). (3.8)
Notice that the relative entropy in (3.8) takes an infinite value when any word transition
that appears in the unknown text does not appear in the profile. In practice we compute the
relative entropy in (3.7) by summing only over the non-zero transitions in the profiles,
H(P1, P2) =
∑
i,j|P2(fi,fj)6=0
π(fi)P1(fi, fj) log
P1(fi, fj)
P2(fi, fj)
. (3.9)
Because the calculation of relative entropy in (3.9) only adds relative entropy for nonzero
transitions, profiles built from fewer total words will on average contain less nonzero tran-
sitions and will thus sum together fewer terms than larger profiles. When attributing an
unknown text among profiles of varying size, we avoid this potential biasing for smaller
profiles by summing only over transitions that are nonzero in every profile being consid-
ered,
H(P1, P2) =
∑
i,j|Pc(fi,fj)6=0
for all ac∈A
π(fi)P1(fi, fj) log
P1(fi, fj)
P2(fi, fj)
. (3.10)
We proceed to specify the selection of function words in F as well as the choice of the
parameters α and D after the following remark.
Remark 1 For the relative entropies in (3.8) to be well defined, the MCs Pu associated
with the unknown texts have to be ergodic to ensure that the limiting distributions π in
(3.7), (3.9) and (3.10) exist. This is true if the texts that generated Pu are sufficiently long.
If this is not true for a particular network, we replace π(fi) with the expected fraction of
18
time a randomly initialized walk spends in state fi. The random initial function word is
drawn from a distribution given by the word frequencies in the text.
Chapter 4
Function Words and WAN Parameters
The classification accuracy of the function WANs introduced in Chapter 3 depends on
the choice of several variables and parameters: the set of sentence delimiters or stopper
symbols, the window length D, the discount factor α, and the set of function words F
defining the nodes of the adjacency networks. In this section, we study the selection of
these parameters to maximize classification accuracy.
The selections of stopper symbols and window lengths are not critical. As stoppers
we include the grammatical sentence delimiters ‘.’, ‘?’ and ‘!’, as well as semicolons ‘;’
to form the stopper set {. ? ! ;}. We include semicolons since they are used primarily to
connect two independent clauses [26]. In any event, the inclusion or not of the semicolon
as a stopper symbol entails a minor change in the generation of WANs due to its infrequent
use. As window length we pick D = 10, i.e., we consider that two words are not related
if they appear more than 10 positions apart from each other. Larger values of D lead to
19
20
higher computational complexity without increase in accuracy since grammatical relations
of words more than 10 positions apart are rare.
In order to choose which function words to include when generating the WANs we
present two different approaches: a static methodology and an adaptive strategy. The static
approach consists in picking the function words most frequently used in the union of all the
texts being considered in the attribution, i.e, all those that we use to build the profile and
those being attributed. By using the most frequent function words we base the attribution
on repeated grammatical structures and limit the influence of noise introduced by unusual
sequences of words which are not consistent stylometric markers. In our experiments, we
see that selecting a number of functions words between 40 and 70 yields optimal accuracy.
As an illustration, we consider in Fig. 4.1a the attribution of 1,000 texts of length 10,000
words among 7 authors chosen at random from our pool of 19th century authors [32] for a
fixed value of α = 0.75 and profiles of 100,000 words – see also Chapter 5 for a description
of the corpus. The solid line in this figure represents the accuracy achieved when using
a network composed of the n most common function words in the texts analyzed for n
going from 2 to 100. Accuracy is maximal when we use exactly 50 function words, but
the differences are minimal and likely due to random variations for values of n between
n = 42 and n = 66. The flatness of the accuracy curve is convenient because it shows that
the method is not sensitive to the choice of n. In this particular example we can choose any
value between, say n = 45 and n = 60, without affecting reliability. In a larger test where
we also vary the length of the profiles, the length of the texts attributed, and the number of
21
candidate authors, we find that including 60 function words is empirically optimal.
The adaptive approach still uses the most common function words but adapts the num-
ber of function words used to the specific attribution problem. In order to choose the num-
ber of function words, we implement repeated leave-one-out cross validation as follows.
For every candidate author ai ∈ A, we concatenate all the known texts T (i) written by ai
and then break up this collection into N pieces of equal length. We build a profile for each
author by randomly picking N − 1 pieces for each of them. We then attribute the unused
pieces between the authors utilizing WANs of n function words for n varying in a given
interval [nmin, nmax]. We perform M of these cross validation rounds in which we change
the random selection of the N − 1 texts that build the profiles. The value of n that maxi-
mizes accuracy across these M trials is selected as the number of nodes for the WANs. We
perform attributions using the corresponding n word WANs for the profiles as well as for
the texts to be attributed. In our numerical experiments we have found that using N = 10,
nmin = 20, nmax = 80, and M varying between 10 and 100 depending on the available

The dashed line in Fig. 4.1a represents the accuracy obtained by implementing the
adaptive strategy with N = 10, nmin = 20, nmax = 80, and M = 100 for the same
attribution problem considered in the static method – i.e., attribution of 1,000 texts of length
10,000 words among 7 authors for α = 0.75 and profiles of 100,000 words. The accuracy
is very similar to the best correct classification rate achieved by the static method. This
is not just true of this particular example but also true in general. The static approach is

faster because it requires no online training to select the number of words n to use in the
WANs. The adaptive strategy is suitable for a wider range of problems because it contains
less assumptions than the static method about the best structure to differentiate between
the candidate authors. E.g., when shorter texts are analyzed, experiments show that the
optimal static method uses slightly less than 60 words. Likewise, the optimal choice of the
number of words in the WANs changes slightly with the time period of the authors, the
specific authors considered, and the choice of parameter α. These changes are captured by
the adaptive approach. We advocate adaptation in general and reserve the static method for
rapid attribution of texts or cases when the number of texts available to build profiles is too
small for effective cross-validation.
To select the decay parameter we use the adaptive leave-one-out cross validation method
for different values of α and study the variation of the correct classification rate as α varies.
23
In Fig. 4.1b we show the variation of the correct classification rate with α when attributing
1,000 texts of length 10,000 words between 7 authors of the 19th century picked at random
from our text corpus [32] using profiles with 100,000 words. As in the case of the number
of words used in the WANs there is a wide range of values for which variations are min-
imal and likely due to randomness. This range lies approximately between α = 0.7 and
α = 0.85. Notice that for the particular case of α = 1, the WANs store the frequencies
of appearances for pairs of function words within the window length D. However, Fig.
4.1b reveals that the discounted approach where α < 1 achieves better results when α is
optimized. In a larger test where we also vary text and profile lengths as well as the number
of candidate authors we find that α = 0.75 is optimal. We found no gains in an adaptive
method to choose α.

Chapter 5
Attribution Accuracy
Henceforth, we fix the WAN generation parameters to the optimal values found in Chapter
4, i.e., the set of sentence delimiters is { . ? ! ; }, the discount factor is α = 0.75, and
the window length is D = 10. The set of function words F is picked adaptively for every
attribution problem by performing M = 10 cross validation rounds.
The text corpus used for the simulations consists of authors from two different peri-
ods [32]. The first group corresponds to 21 authors spanning the 19th century, both Amer-
ican – such as Nathaniel Hawthorne and Herman Melville – and British – such as Jane
Austen and Charles Dickens. For these 21 authors, we have an average of 6.5 books per
author with a minimum of 4 books for Charlotte Bronte and a maximum of 10 books for
Herman Melville and Mark Twain. In terms of words, this translates into an average of
560,000 words available per author with a minimum of 284,000 words for Louisa May
Alcott and a maximum of 1,096,000 for Mark Twain. The second group of authors corre-
25
26
sponds to 7 Early Modern English playwrights spanning the late 16th century and the early
17th century, namely William Shakespeare, George Chapman, John Fletcher, Ben Jonson,
Christopher Marlowe, Thomas Middleton, and George Peele. For these authors we have an
average of 22 plays per author with a minimum of 4 plays for Peele and a maximum of 47
plays written either completely or partially by Fletcher. In terms of word length, we count
with an average length of 400,000 words per author with a minimum of 50,000 for Peele
and a maximum of 900,000 for Fletcher.
To illustrate authorship attribution with function WANs, we solve an authorship attri-
bution problem with two candidate authors: Mark Twain and Herman Melville. For each
candidate author we are given five known texts and are asked to attribute ten unknown texts,
five of which were written by Twain while the other five belong to Melville [32]. Every text
in this attribution belongs to a different book and corresponds to a 10,000 word extract, i.e.
around 25 pages of a paper back midsize edition. The five known texts from each author
are used to generate corresponding profiles as described in Chapter 3. Relative entropies
in (3.9) from each of the ten unknown texts to each of the two resulting profiles are then
computed.
Since relative entropies are not metrics, we use multidimensional scaling (MDS) [33] to
embed the two profiles and the ten unknown texts in 2-dimensional Euclidean metric space
with minimum distortion. The result is illustrated in Fig. 5.1a. Twain’s and Melville’s
profiles are depicted as red and blue filled circles, respectively. Unknown texts are depicted
as empty circles, where the color indicates the real author, i.e. red for Twain and blue for

Melville. A solid black line composed of points equidistant to both profiles is also plotted.
This line delimits the two half planes that result in attribution to one author or the other.
From Fig. 5.1a, we see that the attribution is perfect for these two authors. All red (Twain)
empty circles fall in the half plane closer to the filled red circle and all blue (Melville) empty
circles fall in the half plane closer to the filled blue circle. We emphasize that the WAN
attributions are not based on these Euclidean distances but on the non-metric dissimilarities
given by the relative entropies. Since the number of points is small, the MDS distortion is
minor and the distances in Fig. 5.1a are close to the relative entropies. The latter separate
the points better, i.e., relative entropies are smaller for texts of the same author and larger
for texts of different authors.
We also illustrate an attribution between three authors by creating a profile for Jane
Austen using five 10,000 word excerpts and adding five 10,000 word excerpts of texts writ-
ten by Jane Austen to the ten excerpts to attribute from Twain and Melville’s books. We
28
then perform an attribution of the 15 texts to the three profiles constructed. An MDS ap-
proximate representation of the relative entropies between texts and profiles is shown in
Fig. 5.1b where filled circles represent profiles and empty circles represent texts. Different
colors are used to distinguish Twain (red), Melville (blue), and Austen (green). We also
plot the Voronoi tessellation induced by the three profiles, which specify the regions of the
plane that are attributable to each author. Different from the case in Fig. 5.1a, attribution
is not perfect since one of Austen’s texts is mistakenly attributed to Melville. This is rep-
resented in Fig 5.1b by the green empty circle that appears in the section of the Voronoi
tessellation that corresponds to the blue profile. In general, for larger number of candidate
authors, the distortion introduced by the MDS embedding is higher, compromising the re-
liability of any classifier based on the low-dimensional metric representation. Notice that
this does not affect the WAN attribution, which is based on the non-metric dissimilarities
given by the relative entropies. Besides the number of authors, the other principal deter-
minants of classification accuracy are the length of the profiles, the length of the texts of
unknown authorship, and the similarity of writing styles as captured by the relative en-
tropy dissimilarities between profiles. We study these effects in sections 5.1,5.2, and 5.3,
respectively.
5.1 Varying Profile Length
The profile length is defined as the total number of words, function or otherwise, used to
construct the profile. To study the effect of varying profile lengths we fix α = 0.75,D = 10,

and vary the length of author profiles from 10,000 to 100,000 words in increments of 10,000
words. For each profile length, we attribute texts containing 25,000, 5,000 and 1,000 words,
and for each given combination of profile and text length, we consider problems ranging
from binary attribution to attribution between ten authors. To build profiles, we use ten
texts of the same length randomly chosen among all the texts written by a given author. The
length of each excerpt is such that the ten pieces add up to the desired profile length. E.g.,
to build a profile of length 50,000 words for Melville, we randomly pick ten excerpts of
5,000 words each among all the texts written by him. For the texts to be attributed, however,
we always select contiguous extracts of the desired length. E.g., for texts of length 25,000
words, we randomly pick excerpts of this length written by some author – as opposed to
the selection of ten pieces of different origin we do for the profiles. This resembles the
usual situation where the profiles are built from several sources but the texts to attribute
correspond to a single literary creation. For a given profile size and number of authors,
several attribution experiments were run by randomly choosing the set of authors among
those from the 19th century [32] and randomly choosing the texts forming the profiles. The
amount of attribution experiments was chosen large enough to ensure that every accuracy
value in tables 5.1 - 5.3 is based on the attribution of at least 600 texts.
The accuracy results of attributing a text of 25,000 words are stated in Table 5.1. This
word length is equivalent to around 60 pages of a midsize paperback novel – i.e., a novella,
or a few book chapters – or the typical length of a Shakespeare play. In the last column
of the table we inform the expected accuracy of random attribution between the candidate
31
authors. The purpose of this column is not to provide a performance benchmark. However,
the difference between the accuracies of this column and the rest of the table indicates that
WANs do carry stylometric information useful for authorship attribution. For a compari-
son of the performance of WAN attribution with state of the art classifiers see Chapter 7.
Overall, attribution of texts with 25,000 words can be done with high accuracy even when
attributing among a large number of authors if reasonably large corpora are available to
build author profiles with 60,000 to 100,000 words. E.g., for a profile containing 40,000
words, our method achieves an accuracy of 0.985 for binary attributions whereas the cor-
responding random accuracy is 0.5. As expected, accuracy decreases when the number of
candidate authors increases. E.g., for profiles of 80,000 words, an accuracy of 0.986 is
obtained for binary attributions whereas an accuracy of 0.935 is obtained when the pool of
candidates contains ten authors. Observe that accuracy does not monotonically decrease
when increasing the candidate authors due to the noise introduced by the random selection
of authors and texts.
Accuracy increases with longer profiles. E.g., when performing attributions of 25,000
word texts among 6 authors, the accuracy obtained for profiles of length 10,000 is 0.760
whereas the accuracy obtained for profiles of length 60,000 is 0.941. There is a saturation
effect concerning the length of the profile that depends on the number of authors being
considered. For binary attributions there is no major increase in accuracy beyond profiles
of length 30,000. However, when the number of candidate authors is 7, accuracy stabilizes
for profiles of length in the order of 80,000 words. There seems to be little benefit in using
32
profiles containing more than 100,000 words, which corresponds to a short novel of about
250 pages.
Correct attribution rates of shorter excerpts containing 5,000 words are shown in Table
5.2 for the same profile lengths and number of candidate authors considered in Table 5.1.
A text of this length corresponds to about 13 pages of a novel – something in the order of
the chapter of a book – or an act in a Shakespeare play. When considering these shorter
texts, acceptable classification accuracy is achieved except for very short profiles and large
number of authors, while reliable attribution requires a small number of candidate authors
or a large profile. E.g., attribution between three authors with profiles of 70,000 words has
an average accuracy of 0.943. While smaller than the corresponding correct attribution rate
of 0.982 for texts of length 25,000 words, this is still a respectable number. To achieve an
accuracy in excess of 0.9 for the case of three authors we need a profile of at least 50,000
words.
For very short texts of 1,000 words, which is about the length of an opinion piece in
a newspaper, a couple pages in a novel, or a scene in a Shakespeare play, we can provide
indications of authorship but cannot make definitive claims. As shown in Table 5.3, the best
accuracies are for binary attributions that hover at around 0.8 when we use profiles longer
than 40,000 words. For attributions between more than 2 authors, maximum correct attri-
bution rates are achieved for profiles containing 90,000 or 100,000 words and range from
0.757 for the case of three authors to 0.556 when considering ten authors. These rates are
markedly better than random attribution but not sufficient for definitive statements. The re-

5.2 Varying Text Length
In this section we analyze the effect of text length in attribution accuracy for varying profile
lengths and number of candidate authors. Using α = 0.75 andD = 10, we consider profiles
of length 100,000, 20,000 and 5,000 words and vary the number of candidate authors from
two to ten. The text lengths considered are 1,000 words to 6,000 words in 1,000 word
increments, 8,000 words, and 10,000 to 30,000 words in 5,000 word increments. The

fine resolution for short texts permits estimating the shortest texts that can be attributed
accurately. As in Section 5.1, for every combination of number of authors and text length,
enough independent attribution experiments were performed to ensure that every accuracy
value in tables 5.4 - 5.6 is based on at least 600 attributions.
For profiles of length 100,000 words, the results are reported in Table 5.4. As done in
tables 5.1-5.3, we state the expected accuracy of random attribution in the last column of
the table. Accuracies reported towards the right end of the table, i.e. 20,000-30,000 words,
correspond to the attribution of a dramatic play or around 60 pages of a novel, which we
will refer to as long texts. Accuracies for columns in the middle of the table, i.e. 5,000-
8,000 words, correspond to an act in a dramatic play or between 12 and 20 pages of a novel,
which we will refer to as medium texts. The left columns of this table, i.e. 1,000-3,000
words, correspond to a scene in a play, 2 to 7 pages in a novel or an article in a newspaper,
which we will refer to as short texts. For the attribution of long texts, we achieve a mean
accuracy of 0.988 for binary attributions which decreases to an average accuracy of 0.945
when the number of candidate authors is increased to ten. For medium texts, the decrease
35
in accuracy is not very significant for binary attributions, with a mean accuracy of 0.955,
but the accuracy is reduced to 0.856 for attributions among ten authors. The accuracy is
decreased further when attributing short texts, with a mean accuracy of 0.894 for binary
attributions and 0.700 for the case with ten candidates. This indicates that when profiles
of around 100,000 are available, WANS achieve accuracies over 0.95 for medium to long
texts. For short texts, acceptable classification rates are achieved if the number of candidate
authors is between two and four.
If we reduce the length of the profiles to 20,000 words, reasonable accuracies are at-
tained for small pools of candidate authors; see Table 5.5. E.g, for binary attributions, the
range of correct classification varies between 0.812 for texts of 1,000 words to 0.969 for
texts with 30,000 words. The first of these numbers means that we can correctly attribute a
newspaper opinion piece with accuracy 0.812 if we are given corpora of 20 opinion pieces
by the candidate authors. The second of these numbers means that we can correctly at-
tribute a play between two authors with accuracy 0.969 if we are given corpora of 20,000
words by the candidate authors. Further reducing the profile length to 5,000 words results
in classification accuracies that are acceptable only when we consider binary attributions
and texts of at least 10,000 words; see Table 5.6. For shorter texts or larger number of
candidate authors, WANs can provide supporting evidence but not definitive proof.
In Sections 5.1 and 5.2, the profiles across all candidates authors are balanced, i.e.
they contain the same number of words. Attribution can be performed in scenarios with
unbalanced profiles where the shortest profile contains nshort words and the longest one

racy is attained for attribution between authors which are more dissimilar.
contains nlong words. In this case, the accuracy obtained is lower than the one corresponding
to a balanced scenario with the same number of candidate authors and every profile of
length nlong and larger than that of a balanced scenario with profiles of length nshort words.
5.3 Inter-Profile Dissimilarities
Besides the number of candidate authors and the length of the texts and profiles, the correct
attribution of a text is also dependent on the similarity of the writing styles of the authors
themselves. Indeed, repeated binary attributions between Henry James and Washington
Irving with random generation of 100,000 word profiles yield a perfect accuracy of 1.0 on
the classification of 400 texts of 10,000 words each. The same exercise when attributing
between Grant Allen and Robert Louis Stevenson yields a classification rate of 0.91. This
occurs because the stylometric fingerprints of Allen and Stevenson are harder to distinguish
37
than those of James and Irving.
Dissimilarity of writing styles can be quantified by computing the relative entropies
between the profiles [cf. (3.9)]. Since relative entropies are asymmetric, i.e., H(P1, P2) 6=
H(P2, P1) in general, we consider the average of the two relative entropies between two
profiles as a measure of their dissimilarity. For each pair of authors, the relative entropy
is computed based on the set of function words chosen adaptively to maximize the cross
validation accuracy. For the 100,000 word profiles of James and Irving, the inter-profile
dissimilarity resulting from the average of relative entropies is 0.184. The inter-profile dis-
similarity between Allen and Stevenson is 0.099. This provides a formal measure of sim-
ilarity of writing styles which explains the higher accuracy of attributions between James
and Irving with respect to attributions between Allen and Stevenson.
The correlation between inter-profile dissimilarities and attribution accuracy is corrob-
orated by Fig. 5.2. Each point in this plot corresponds to the selection of two authors at
random from our pool of 21 authors from the 19th century. For each pair we select ten texts
of 10,000 words each to generate profiles of length 100,000 words. We then attribute ten
of the remaining excerpts of length 10,000 words of each of these two authors among the
two profiles and record the correct attribution rate as well as the dissimilarity between the
random profiles generated. The process is repeated twenty times for these two authors to
produce the average dissimilarity and accuracy that yield the corresponding point in Fig.
5.2. E.g., consider two randomly chosen authors for which we have 50 excerpts of 10,000
word available. We select ten random texts to form a profile and attribute 20 out of the
38
remaining 80 excerpts – 10 for each author. After repeating this procedure twenty times we
get the average accuracy of attributing 400 texts of length 10,000 words between the two
authors.
Besides the positive correlation between inter-profile dissimilarities and attribution ac-
curacies, Fig. 5.2 shows that classification is perfect for 11 out of 12 instances where the
inter-profile dissimilarity exceeds 0.16. Errors are rare for profile dissimilarities between
0.10 and 0.16 since correct classifications average 0.984 and account for at least 0.96 of the
attribution results in all but three outliers. For pairs of authors with dissimilarities smaller
than 0.1 the average accuracy is 0.942.
Chapter 6
Meta Attribution Analysis
WANs can also be used to study problems other than attribution between authors. In this
section we demonstrate that WANs carry information about time periods, the genre of the
composition, and the gender of the authors. We also illustrate the use of WANs in detecting
collaborations.
6.1 Time
WANs carry information about the point in time in which a text was written. If we build
random profiles of 200,000 words for Shakespeare, Chapman, and Melville and compute
the inter-profile dissimilarity as in Section 5.3, we obtain a dissimilarity of 0.04 between
Shakespeare and Chapman and of 0.17 between Shakespeare and Melville. Since inter-
profile dissimilarity is a measure of difference in style, this values are reasonable given that
Shakespeare and Chapman were contemporaries but Melville lived more than two centuries

Figure 6.1: (a) MDS plot for authors of different time periods. Authors from the early 17th century
are depicted as blue stars while authors from the 19th century are depicted as red dots. Inter-profile
dissimilarities are small within the groups and large between them. (b) Heat map of inter-profile
relative entropies. High inter-profile relative entropies are illustrated with warmer colors. Two
groups of authors with small inter-profile relative entropies are apparent: the first seven correspond
to 17th century authors and the rest to 19th century authors.
after them.
To further illustrate this point, in Fig. 6.1a we plot a two dimensional MDS represen-
tation of the dissimilarity between eight authors whose profiles were built with all their
available texts in our corpus [32]. Four of the profiles correspond to early 17th century
authors – Shakespeare, Chapman, Jonson, and Fletcher – and are represented by blue stars
while the other four – Doyle, Melville, Garland, and Allen – correspond to 19th century
authors and are represented by red dots. Notice that authors tend to have a smaller distance
with their contemporaries and a larger distance with authors from other periods. This fact is
also illustrated by the heat map of inter-profile relative entropies in Fig. 6.1b where bluish
colors represent smaller entropies. Since heat maps allow the representation of asymmetric
data, we directly plot the relative entropies instead of the symmetrized inter-profile dissim-
ilarities. The first 7 rows and columns correspond to authors of the 17th century whereas
41

Shakespeare (Com.) 11.6 7.7
Shakespeare (His.) 7.6 9.3
the remaining 21 correspond to authors of the 19th century, where profiles were built with
all the available texts. Notice that the blocks of blue color along the diagonal are in perfect
correspondence with the time period of the authors, verifying that WANs can be used to
determine the time in which a text was written. The average entropies among authors of
the 17th century and among those of the 19th century are 0.096 and 0.098 respectively,
whereas the average entropies between authors of different epochs is 0.273. I.e., the rela-
tive entropy between authors of different epochs almost triples that of authors belonging to
the same time period.
6.2 Genre
Even though function words by themselves do not carry content, WANs constructed from
a text contain, rather surprisingly, information about its genre. We illustrate this fact in
Fig. 6.2, where we present the relative entropy between 20 pieces of texts written by
Shakespeare of length 20,000 words, where 10 of them are history plays – e.g., Richard
II, King John, Henry VIII – and 10 of them are comedies – e.g., The Tempest, Measure
for Measure, The Merchant of Venice. As in Fig. 6.1b, bluish colors in Fig. 6.2 represent
smaller relative entropies. Two blocks along the diagonal can be distinguished that coincide
with the plays of the two different genres. Indeed, if we sequentially extract one text from
42
Table 6.2: Relative entropies from Two Noble Kinsmen to different profiles (x100).
Sh. Jon. Fle. Mid. Cha. Marl.
19.1 20.0 18.2 20.2 19.5 20.9
the group and attribute it to a genre by computing the average relative entropies to the
remaining histories and comedies, the 20 pieces are correctly attributed to their genre.
More generally, inter-profile dissimilarities between authors that write in the same genre
tend to be smaller than between authors that write in different genres. As an example,
in Table 6.1 we compute the dissimilarity between two Shakespeare profiles – one built
with comedies and the other with histories – and two contemporary authors: Marlowe and
Chapman. All profiles contain 100,000 words formed by randomly picking 10 extracts of
10,000 words. Marlowe never wrote a comedy and mainly focused on histories – Edward
II, The Massacre at Paris – and tragedies – The Jew of Malta, Dido –, while the majority of
Chapman’s plays are comedies – All Fools, May Day. Genre choice impacts the inter-profile
dissimilarity since the comedy profile of Shakespeare is closer to Chapman than to Marlowe
and vice versa for the history profile of Shakespeare. The inter-profile dissimilarity between
Shakespeare profiles is 6.2, which is still smaller than any dissimilarity in Table 6.1. This
points towards the conclusion that the identity of the author is the main determinant of the
writing style but that the genre of the text being written also contributes to the word choice.
In general, two texts of the same author but different genres are more similar than two texts
of the same genre but different authors which, in turn, are more similar than two texts of
different authors and genres.

correspond to history plays while the last 10 correspond to comedy plays. Relative entropies within
texts of the same genre are smaller than across genres.

6.3 Gender
Word usage can be used for author profiling [34] and, in particular, to infer the gender of
an author from the written text. To illustrate this, we divide the 21 authors from the 19th
century [32] into females – five of them – and males. We pick a gender at random and
pick an excerpt of 10,000 words from any author of the selected gender. We then build
two 100,000 words profiles, one containing pieces of texts written by male authors and the
other by female authors. In order to avoid bias, we do not include any text of the author
from which the text to attribute was chosen in the gender profiles. We then attribute the
chosen text between the two gender profiles. After repeating this procedure 5,000 times,

Marl. 17.4 17.1 17.6 17.3 17.4 18.1
we obtain a mean accuracy of 0.63. Although this accuracy is lower than state-of-the-art
gender profiling methods [35], the difference with random attribution, i.e. accuracy of 0.5,
validates the fact that WANs carry gender information about the authors.
6.4 Collaborations
WANs can also be used for the attribution of texts written collaboratively between two
or more authors. Since collaboration was a common practice for playwrights in the early
17th century, we consider the attribution of Early Modern English plays [32]. For a given
play, we compute its relative entropy to six contemporary authors – Shakespeare, Jonson,
Fletcher, Middleton, Chapman, and Marlowe – by generating 50 random profiles for each
author of length 80,000 words and averaging the 50 entropies to obtain one representative
number. We do not consider Peele in the analysis due to the short total length of available
texts.
When two authors collaborate to write a play, the resulting word adjacency network
is close to the profiles of both authors, even though these profiles are built with plays of
their sole authorship. As an example, consider the play Two Noble Kinsmen which is an
45
accepted collaboration between Fletcher and Shakespeare [36]. In Table 6.2, we present
the relative entropies between the play and the six analyzed authors. Notice that the two
minimum entropies correspond to those who collaborated in writing it.
Collaboration can be further confirmed by the construction of hybrid profiles, i.e. pro-
files built containing 40,000 words of two different authors. Each entry in Table 6.3 cor-
responds to the relative entropy from Two Noble Kinsmen to a hybrid profile composed
by the authors in the row and column of that entry. Notice that the diagonal of Table 6.3
corresponds to profiles of sole authors and, thus, coincides with Table 6.2. The smallest
relative entropy in Table 6.3 is achieved by the hybrid profile composed by Fletcher and
Shakespeare, which is consistent with the accepted attribution of the play.
The attribution between hybrid profiles is not always accurate. For example, consider
the play Eastward Ho which is a collaboration between three authors, two of which are
Chapman and Jonson [36]. If we repeat the above procedure and compute the relative en-
tropies between the play and the different pure profiles, we see that in fact the two smallest
entropies are achieved for Jonson and Chapman; see the diagonal in Table 6.4. However,
the smallest entropy in the whole table is achieved by the hybrid profile composed by Jon-
son and Middleton. The hybrid profile of Jonson and Chapman, the real authors, achieves
an entropy of 16.7, which is the second smallest among all profiles in Table 6.4.

Chapter 7
Comparison and Combination with
Frequency based methods
Machine learning tools have been used to solve attribution problems by relying on the
frequency of appearance of function words [37]. These methods consider the number of
times an author uses different function words but, unlike WANs, do not contemplate the
order in which the function words appear. The most common techniques include naive
Bayes [38, Chapter 8], nearest neighbors (NN) [38, Chapter 2], decision trees (DT) [38,
Chapter 14], and support vector machines (SVM) [38, Chapter 7].
In Table 7.1 we inform the percentage of errors obtained by different methods when
attributing texts of 10,000 words among profiles of 100,000 words for a number of authors
ranging from two to ten. For a given number of candidate authors, we randomly pick
them from the pool of 19th century authors [32] and attribute ten excerpts of each of them
47
48
Table 7.1: Error rates in % achieved by different methods for profiles of 100,000 words and texts of
10,000 words. The WANs achieve the smallest error rate among the methods considered separately.
Voting decreases the error even further by combining the relational data of the WANs with the
frequency data of other methods.

using the different methods. We then repeat the random choice of authors 100 times and
average the error rate. For each of the methods based on function word frequencies, we
pick the set of parameters and preprocessing that minimize the attribution error rate. E.g.,
for SVM the error is minimized when considering a polynomial kernel of degree 3 and
normalizing the frequencies by text length. For the nearest neighbors method we consider
two strategies based on one (1-NN) and three (3-NN) nearest neighbors as given by the l2
metric in Euclidean space. Also, for decision trees we consider two types of split criteria:
the Gini Diversity Index (DT-gdi) and the cross-entropy (DT-ce) [39].
The WANs achieve a lower attribution error than frequency based methods; see Table
7.1. For binary attributions, naive Bayes and SVM achieve error rates of 2.6% and 2.7%
respectively and, thus, outperform nearest neighbors and decision trees. However, WANs
outperform the aforementioned methods by obtaining an error rate of 1.6%. This implies
a reduction of 38% in the error rate. For 6 authors, WANs achieve an error rate of 5.3%
that outperform SVMs achieving 7.9% entailing a 33% reduction. This trend is consis-
tent across different number of candidate authors, with WANs achieving an average error
reduction of 29% compared with the best traditional machine learning method.
49
More important than the fact that WANs tend to outperform methods based on word
frequencies, is the fact that they carry different stylometric information. Thus, we can
combine both methodologies to further increase attribution accuracy. We do this via a vot-
ing method, where we perform majority voting between WANs and the two best performing
frequency based methods, namely, naive Bayes and SVMs. More specifically, each of the
three methods gives one vote to its preferred candidate author and then the voting method
chooses the author with more votes. In case of a three-way tie, the candidate author voted
by the WANs is chosen. In the last column of Table 7.1 we inform the error rate of major-
ity voting between WANs and the two best performing frequency based methods, namely,
naive Bayes and SVMs. For the voting method, the error rates are consistently smaller
than those achieved by WANs and, hence, by the other frequency based methods as well.
E.g., for attributions among four authors, voting achieves an error of 3.3% compared to an
error of 4.6% of WANs. This corresponds to a 28% reduction in error. Averaging among
attributions for different number of candidate authors, majority voting entails a reduction
of 30% compared with WANs. The combination of WANs and function word frequencies
halves the attribution error rate with respect to the current state of the art.
Although the error rates presented in Table 7.1 correspond to profiles of balanced
length, the results also hold for scenarios where different profiles contain different number
of words. This means that, for unbalanced scenarios, the WANs still outperform traditional
classifiers and the voting method also achieves the lowest error rates.

Chapter 8
Early Modern English Literature
The stylometric analysis in this part of the thesis focuses on the attribution of plays writ-
ten during the English Early Modern period stretching from the late 16th century to the
early 17th century. William Shakespeare is the most prominent playwright active in this
period but there are several other authors that were also active during this time. Due to the
rudimentary documentation and the frequent collaborations among playwrights, there are
plenty of authorship controversies around the plays written in this period. We can divide
these controversies into two categories: finding the real authors of anonymous plays and
determining which author wrote which part in collaborative plays. By using WANs, we
tackle both types of controversies and in some cases we support existing theories whereas
in others we propose new theories of our own.
53
54
8.1 Author Profiles
We focus on the authors listed below where we also detail the number of plays that are
currently attributed to each of them and the period during which they are presumed to
have written said plays. The information is compiled from the Database of Early English
Playbooks (DEEP) [36] and the database of catalogued plays in Chadwyck-Healey Liter-
ature Online (LION) [40]. Whenever inconsistencies in authorship information arise, we
consider [36] as accurate.
(1) George Chapman (1559-1634), active circa 1596-1620. Considered sole author of a
total of 13 plays plus 2 collaborations.
(2) John Fletcher (1579-1625), active circa 1605-1625. Supposed to have written 47
plays, being sole author in 22 of them while Francis Beaumont and Phillip Massinger
were his main collaborators in the rest.
(3) Ben Jonson (1572-1637), active circa 1596-1637. Presumed sole author of 17 plays
plus 1 collaboration.
(4) Christopher Marlowe (1564-1593), active circa 1586-1593. Putative sole author of 6
plays and 1 collaboration.
(5) Thomas Middleton (1580-1627), active circa 1603-1625. Believed to have written
26 plays, 14 of them as sole author and 12 in collaboration.
(6) William Shakespeare (1564-1616), active circa 1589-1614. A total of 38 plays are
attributed to Shakespeare and collaborators.
In the above list, we do not consider as plays minor dramatical compositions such as
masques, entertainments and pageants. Chapman, Fletcher, Jonson, Marlowe, Middle-
ton, and Shakespeare are included in our analysis since they posses large and well studied
canons compared with their contemporaries.
55
The WAN attribution algorithm developed in the first part of this work uses known
texts of a given author to construct a profile against which unknown texts are compared.
Since profiling accuracy increases with the length of the texts considered when building
the profile, we build profiles from all texts of sole authorship for a given author that have
little or no history of authorship dispute. The full list of plays used to build the six profiles
is reported in Table 8.1. When building profiles for a given author, we generally subscribe
to the information provided in [36] to determine texts of sole authorship. An exception to
this is Middleton, who’s profile is built using the texts attributed to him in the 2007 Oxford
Collected Works of Middleton [41], which contains a more recent and accepted study of his
canon. Two plays included in Middleton’s corpus in [41]–The Revenger’s Tragedy and The
Second Maiden’s Tragedy–were published anonymously and have long history of disputed
authorship [42–45]. To be safe, we do not include these plays in Middleton’s profile but
provide an analysis of their authorship in Chapter 10.
Notice that each profile is built from a different number of texts. Marlowe, the least
prolific writer of the ones here considered, is accepted as the sole author of 6 plays that
totalize 103,160 words. Shakespeare, the most prolific sole author, is the undisputed sole
author of 28 plays, totaling 679,256 words. Due to this difference, we compute the relative
entropy between the WAN of an unknown text u ∈ U and each profile using (3.10) rather
than (3.9).
In order to generate faithful representations of authors’ styles, we remove artifacts in-
troduced by modern transcriptions by using the earliest editions available of each text in

the LION database [40], with the exception of Shakespeare’s First Quarto editions. Al-
though Shakespeare’s canon was first published in full in 1623, there exist earlier editions
for a number of his plays known as First Quartos. As there is currently no scholarly con-
sensus on which editions are more authoritative, to be consistent we use 1623 editions for
all Shakespeare texts. When using original transcriptions we have to account for the fact
that many words had multiple accepted spellings during the Early Modern era. E.g., the
word ‘of’ is also spelled as ‘off’, ‘offe’, or ‘o’ whereas the word ‘with’ may also appear as
‘wid’, ‘wyth’, ‘wytt’, ‘wi’, ‘wt’, and ‘wth’. Many of these alternate spellings are used in-
frequently and thus do not contribute highly to the WAN of a text. Nevertheless, we correct
the WANs so that the occurrence of any of the alternative spellings is treated as the same
word. We emphasize that spelling preferences carry little information about the authorship
of a play. Indeed, spellings in printed editions were not necessarily those of authors as
they were often selected by printers to accommodate the fixed length of lines in printing
presses [46]. In addition, we remove speech prefixes, or the character name preceding each
speech, to avoid cases in which character names are abbreviated to function words (e.g.
Anne abbreviated to ‘An’).
For the WANs in this work we use the optimal parameters determined in Chapter 4,
α = 0.75 and D = 10. Because punctuation marks were often added by publishers rather
than the authors themselves [47], we instead delimitate sentences at the end of character
speeches. The WANs are built with the 100 most common function words in the Early
Modern period, listed in Table 8.2. This number is chosen based on an adaptive training

spellings is given in Table 8.3. For the cases where one alternative spelling can be assigned
to multiple conventional spellings, e.g. ‘yt’ can be associated with ‘it’ and ‘that’, we assign
every appearance of the alternative spelling to the most common usage.

introduced in Section 8.1 using expression (3.10); see Table 8.4. Every entry in the table
represents the relative entropy between the corresponding authors in the rows and columns.
In this table, as well as in the remaining of the thesis, relative entropies are multiplied by
100 to facilitate their display. We use the term centinats, or cn for short, to denote the resul-
tant unit of measure of relative entropy. The 4.7 in the Chapman row entry and Shakespeare
60
column entry indicates a relative entropy of 4.7cn between Chapman’s and Shakespeare’s
profiles. Note that, as expression (3.10) is not symmetric, the values in the table are also
not symmetric, although they are similar in most cases. E.g. the relative entropy between
Shakespeare’s and Chapman’s profiles is 4.8cn rather than 4.7cn in the opposite direction.
In general, dissimilarities between profiles in both directions are highly correlated as can
be observed in Fig. 8.1. In this figure, the coordinates of every point correspond to the
dissimilarities in both directions for every pair of profiles. The arrangement of the points
along the diagonal implies that a high dissimilarity in one direction is associated with a
high dissimilarity in the opposite one. Hence, this correlation allows us to speak about the
similarity between two authors without specifying a direction.
The entropy-based dissimilarities in Table 8.4 dispel the Marlovian theory of Shake-
speare authorship [48]. If Marlowe and Shakespeare were the same person, we should
observe the dissimilarities between Marlowe’s and Shakespeare’s profile to be smaller than
the distances between each of the other profiles. However, the relative entropies between
Marlowe’s and Shakespeare’s profiles average 9.5cn which is larger than the dissimilarity
between Shakespeare and all of the other authors. Shakespeare’s profile is, on average,
closest to Jonson profile – average relative entropy of 4.4cn – although still sufficiently dif-
ferent to assert that they belong to different authors, as verified by the attribution of plays
in Chapter 9. The highest dissimilarity among any pair of profiles occurs between Marlowe
and Fletcher with a mean of 16.1cn. As will be seen in Chapter 9, the relative similarity
between two profiles affects our ability to distinguish between them when attributing a text.
Chapter 9
Attribution of Undisputed Plays
We attribute the plays written by Jonson, Middleton, Chapman, Marlowe, and Shakespeare
among the 6 author profiles introduced in Section 8.1. The attribution of Fletcher’s plays
is performed in the discussion of collaborations in Chapter 11. When attributing any given
play, profiles are built using the plays listed in Table 8.1 excluding the play being attributed.
We do not report raw relative entropy values between the play being attributed and the
author profiles, but instead subtract from these values the relative entropy between the play
and a profile containing all available texts. Intuitively, the profile containing all of the texts
represents the writing style of an average playwright from this period. This is done to make
the figures easier to view but does not change the results in any way. Each raw relative
entropy value is discounted by the same constant value, thus preserving relative distances.
As a result, both negative and positive relative entropy values are possible. A negative
relative entropy value indicates that the play’s WAN is more similar to the author profile

than to the profile of the average playwright while a positive relative entropy indicates the
opposite.
9.1 Ben Jonson
In Fig. 9.1 we present the attribution of the 17 plays believed to have been written solely
by Jonson, plus one collaboration. In the horizontal axis we present the plays to attribute
and the vertical axis represents the entropy distance (3.10) in cn from these plays to the

is achieved, correctly attributing 17 of these plays to Jonson, i.e., the entropy distance of
every play to the profiles achieves its minimum for Jonson’s profile. The play, Eastward
Ho, is accepted as a collaboration between Jonson and Chapman plus a third author, John
Marston, whom we have not profiled. Here Chapman is not well ranked, suggesting that
his contributions were minor compared with Jonson’s. The relative contributions of both
Jonson and Chapman in Eastward Ho are analyzed further in Section 11.2.1.
The misattribution in Fig. 9.1 for plays solely written by Jonson occurs for The Case
is Altered, which is misattributed by a small margin. Mixed authorship has been suggested
due to the irregularity in the structure of the last two acts [49]. The play’s content has also
been compared to A Comedy of Errors, written by Shakespeare, who is also here the closest
author [50]. Another play, Sejanus His Fall, is attributed to Jonson but only by a small
margin. It has been pointed out that this play might contain elements of a second author,
with both Shakespeare and Chapman a possible candidates [51,52]. Our analysis indicates
that the play is closer to the style of Shakespeare than to the style of Chapman. Sejanus
His Fall is also one of only two tragedies Jonson published–the other being Catiline His
Conspiracy–possibly biasing results against a profile built almost entirely with comedies.
The relationship between genre and attribution is explored further in Chapter 12.

Figure 9.2: Attribution of Middleton plays. We attribute the 14 plays in Table 8.1, the additional
11 plays in Table 9.1 and 3 collaborations with Shakespeare: Macbeth (MAC), Measure for Mea-
sure (MEA) and Timon of Athens (TIM). Only 2 sole authored plays are misattributed. Also, the
attribution of Shakespeare’s plays reveal that Middleton’s contribution was minor.
9.2 Thomas Middleton
In Fig. 9.2 we present the attribution of 28 plays, 14 of which are generally believed to
have been written only by Middleton and 12 in collaboration. We also include in our set
two plays originally assigned to Middleton–The Family of Love and Match at Midnight–but
not included in his corpus in [41].
Among the 14 plays believed to be solely written by Middleton, we attribute 12 to
Middleton obtaining an accuracy of 85.7%. The first misattributed play, A Game at Chess,
is attributed to Shakespeare by a very small margin, likely due to random error. This is also
true in the case of Hengist King of Kent, noted for being the sole history play Middleton
65
produced. Additionally, although [41] does not find evidence of Middleton in The Family
of Love or Match at Midnight, our results show that he is at least a stronger candidate in
these plays than the other five authors. The low relative entropy value of −3cn between
Middleton’s profile and the WAN of The Family of Love adds evidence to the claim that
Middleton contributed to this play [53].
Among the 12 collaborative plays, 7 are attributed to Middleton. Thomas Dekker and
William Rowley were Middleton’s usual collaborators. As neither of these authors are
profiled, each of the plays written with these authors is attributed here to Middleton with
the exception of The Bloody Banquet, which is marginally attributed to Shakespeare over
Middleton. Another misattributed play, The Spanish Gypsy is usually considered to be a
collaboration between Middleton, Dekker, Rowley, and John Ford [53, 54] which may ex-
plain why Middleton is ranked second behind another author. We also attribute Middleton’s
three collaborations with Shakespeare. Measure for Measure, Timon of Athens, and Mac-
beth are correctly attributed to Shakespeare. Moreover, for these three plays, Middleton is
ranked very poorly being the fourth preferred candidate in all of them. This supports the
accepted idea that Middleton’s contribution in these three plays is minimal [55, 56]. We
examine these plays in closer detail in Section 11.2.3.
9.3 George Chapman
Chapman is considered to be the author of 15 plays, 13 as a sole author and 2 in collab-
oration. In Fig. 9.3, we attribute these plays among the 6 profiles. In total, 10 of the 15

plays are attributed to Chapman. In the cases of plays written in collaboration, The Tragedy
of Chabot, Admiral of France is attributed to Chapman while Eastward Ho is attributed to
Jonson, as discussed in Section 9.1. Notice that of the four remaining misattributions, three
are assigned to Shakespeare with Chapman as the second preferred candidate. This is con-
sistent with the fact that in Table 8.4, Chapman’s profile is most similar to Shakespeare.
Thus, cases of random error will therefore most likely attribute to Shakespeare.

where Dido, Queen of Carthage is the only collaborative work, with Thomas Nashe as

coauthor. We achieve an accuracy of 100% in attributing Marlowe’s sole works. Dido
Queen of Carthage is attributed to Shakespeare by a small margin, with Marlowe as the
second best candidate.
In the case of sole authorship plays, each is attributed to Marlowe by a substantial
margin and with relative entropies between −6cn and −13cn. These large negative values
suggest that the plays are much more similar to Marlowe’s profile than they are to the profile
of an average playwright. This difference may be a result of the fact that Marlowe’s plays
were written at least a decade before most of the other authors considered, thus indicating
a shift in writing style during the one or two decades that separate Marlowe from the rest.

Figure 9.5: Attribution of Shakespeare plays. We attribute the 28 plays in Table 8.1 and the addi-
tional 10 plays in Table 9.2. All plays are attributed to Shakespeare. Marlowe’s distance to a play is
highly dependent on whether the analyzed play is a history play or not, emphasizing the impact of
genre in attribution.
9.5 William Shakespeare
In Fig. 9.5 we present the attribution of 38 plays believed to have been written by Shake-
speare, 30 of which are attributed solely to Shakespeare in [36]. Note that 2 of the 30 sole
authored plays, 2 Henry VI and 3 Henry VI are not included in Shakespeare’s profile in
Table 8.1 because they have a strong history of disputed authorship [57].
All of the 30 plays usually considered to have been written only by Shakespeare are
69
correctly attributed. However, exceptional situations arise for the plays 1 Henry VI, 2
Henry VI, and 3 Henry VI, in which Marlowe is ranked uncharacteristically high. The
fact that Marlowe is ranked second for these plays is noteworthy, since Marlowe’s profile
is very dissimilar from Shakespeare’s in Table 8.4. Consequently, he ranks poorly in the
attribution of most plays. In addition, the relative entropy between Marlowe’s profile and
the WANs of most plays is between +6cn and +10cn, while the relative entropy between
Marlowe’s profile and these plays’ WANs is around +2cn. Similarly, the relative entropy
between Marlowe’s profile and the WANs of Henry V, King John, Richard II, and Richard
III is around +4cn. These seven plays have in common that they are history plays, a
genre in which Marlowe wrote Edward II and Massacre at Paris, comprising a third of
his profile. Thus, there is a genre bias of history plays towards Marlowe. Focusing on the
Henry VI saga, where the first part is a known collaboration of Shakespeare with Nashe, we
see a particularly strong signature of Marlowe in the three plays compared to Shakespeare’s
other history plays. Moreover, these plays were written during Marlowe’s most fertile years
and Marlowe had collaborated with Nashe in 1589 – two years before the Henry VI saga
– when writing his play Dido Queen of Carthage. This supports the hypothesis that there
was an unknown collaborator in these plays [58, 59] and points at Marlowe as a probable
candidate. These collaborations are covered in greater detail in Section 11.2.4.
Among the 8 plays of accepted collaboration with others, besides the mentioned col-
laboration in 1 Henry VI, we can find the three collaborations with Middleton already an-
alyzed in Section 9.2. From the poor ranking of Middleton in the attribution pattern, we
70
can conclude that Middleton’s revisions and contributions were minor. There are also two
collaborations with Fletcher, namely Henry VIII and The Two Noble Kinsmen. We attribute
both to Shakespeare, with Fletcher the second preferred author in the latter. In the case of
the former, on the other hand, Fletcher is not well ranked and his contribution is not evident
from the attribution of the entire play. Shakespeare’s collaborations with both Fletcher and
Middleton are analyzed further in Sections 11.2.2 and 11.2.3, respectively.
9.6 Summary of Results
In total, we attribute correctly 71 out of the 77 plays we consider that are traditionally
attributed to single author and listed in Table 8.1, yielding an accuracy of 92.2%. Further-
more, if we only consider attributions between authors that are more than 5cn apart, then
we fail only in 3, yielding an accuracy of 96.1%. We utilize the high classification power for
plays of sole authorship to shed light on attribution problems of anonymous plays written
during the Early Modern period in Chapter 10.
Of the 20 plays we consider that are generally accepted to be collaborations, we at-
tribute 17 to one of the contributing authors, yielding an accuracy of 85%. Collaborative
plays are analyzed further in Chapter 11.
Chapter 10
Anonymous Plays
In Fig. 10.1 we present the attribution of 8 anonymous plays written during the English
Renaissance. Authorship of some of these plays have been more discussed and studied
by scholars than others. E.g., Edward III is commonly attributed in part to Shakespeare
[60] and our method supports this theory. Indeed, this play was written during the early
stages of Shakespeare’s career and the Shakespeare profile is the closest. Another play
sometimes attributed in part to Shakespeare is Arden of Faversham [60]. Again, our method
supports this theory. These plays are analyzed further in Section 11.2.4. In addition, the
plays The Revenger’s Tragedy, The Second Maiden’s Tragedy, and The Nice Valor are

usually attributed to Middleton [41], with the former two included in the 2007 Oxford
Collected Works. Our method indeed attributes all three works to Middleton. Furthermore,
Fletcher is the second attributed author of The Nice Valor, a play originally included in the
Beaumont and Fletcher folios of 1647 and 1679 [61], leading some to believe that the play
is a collaboration between Fletcher and Middleton.
For the remaining plays, definite statements cannot be made, but we can support or
undermine existing hypothesis. For example, Mucedorus may have been written by Shake-
speare as proposed by a number of scholars [62] since he is the first ranked author among
the six authors we profile. Fair Em has also been assigned to Shakespeare [63] though
there is no scholarly consensus, with Robert Wilson, whom we do not profile, often cited
73
as a likely candidate [62]. The Taming of a Shrew, the play generating controversies about
the better known Shakespeare play with similar title, is here attributed to the Shakespeare
profile. Note, also, that Marlowe is ranked atypically high for this play–second behind
Shakespeare. Both Shakespeare and Marlowe have been proposed as candidates for Tam-
ing of a Shrew [64], in the former case as a possibly early draft of Taming of the Shrew.
While our analysis points to Shakespeare as a more likely candidate, observe that the attri-
bution of Taming of the Shrew in Fig. 9.5 ranks Marlowe as the worst candidate, indicating
that much more of his style is evident in the early draft.

Chapter 11
Collaborations
In cases of multiple authors contributing to a single play, we show how our method is still
able to detect one or more of the authors present in a full text by identifying the top ranked
authors in its attribution.

Figure 11.1: Attribution of solo Fletcher plays. We attribute the 15 plays in Table 8.1 and the
additional 6 plays in Table 11.2. Six plays are not attributed to the sole Fletcher profile and, among
these, two plays are attributed to collaborative profiles including Fletcher.
77
11.1 John Fletcher and collaborators
John Fletcher wrote numerous plays both by himself and with collaborators. Consequently,
his canon is an appropriate text corpus to analyze the attribution of collaborative plays.
In addition to the six profiles in the previous section, we include two profiles built from
plays written with Fletcher’s two most frequent coauthors–Francis Beaumont and Phillip
Massinger; see Table 11.1.
The attribution of Fletcher’s works are divided into two plots. Fig. 11.1 shows the
attribution of plays believed to have been written solely by Fletcher and Fig. 11.2 shows
the attribution of plays believed to have been written in collaboration with other authors.
The set of plays presented before the first red line include attributions of plays written
with Francis Beaumont. The second division shows the attribution of plays written with
Phillip Massinger and the third division shows the attribution of plays written with a mix
of other authors. In both figures we omit the marker corresponding to Marlowe since he
is poorly ranked for every play. This is consistent with Fletcher and Marlowe having the
most dissimilar writing styles; see Table 8.4.
In Fig. 11.1, 15 out of 21 plays are attributed to the solo Fletcher profile. Of the six
plays attributed to other profiles, two of them, The Captain and Queen of Corinth are at-
tributed to one of the profiles for Fletcher and a collaborator. Beggar’s Bush is marginally
assigned to Shakespeare and Jonson. The Faithful Shepherdess, The Noble Gentleman, and
The Fair Maid of the Inn are mistakenly assigned to Shakespeare as well, with Fletcher and
Massinger ranked second. For the latter, existing theories attribute the play to a collabora-

Figure 11.2: Attribution of Fletcher plays written with collaborators. We attribute the plays listed
in Tables 11.1 and 11.2. The first division includes plays written with Beaumont and 7 out of 9 are
correctly assigned to the Fletcher & Beaumont profile. The second division includes plays written
with Massinger and all 14 plays are assigned to the Fletcher & Massinger profile. The third division
includes plays written with other collaborators and 3 out of 7 are assigned to a Fletcher profile. Out

tion of four authors, two of which are Fletcher and Massinger, with Fletcher’s contribution
being minor [65]. This would explain the fact that the Fletcher and Massinger profile is
ranked second but the sole Fletcher profile is poorly ranked.
In Fig. 11.2, 7 of the 9 Fletcher and Beaumont plays are attributed to the Fletcher
and Beaumont profile, while Philaster is assigned to the sole Fletcher profile. A single
mistake occurs for Love’s Cure, a play historically attributed to many different authors [66].
Additionally, all of the 14 Fletcher and Massinger plays are assigned to the Fletcher and
Massinger profile. One of the three Fletcher profiles are also listed as the top candidate
in 3 out of the 7 plays written by Fletcher with other collaborators. Of the four mistakes,

even in cases of mixed authorship and, in many cases, favors profiles built from multiple
contributing authors over profiles built from a single contributing author.
11.2 Intraplay analysis
We examine the authorship of collaborative plays through the attribution of its individual
acts and scenes. In Section 11.1 we analyzed examples of detecting collaboration in full
plays by looking at the top candidate authors. This does not, however, suggest any partic-

we may attribute pieces of the play separate from one another to gain deeper insight as to
how the play was written. We also see cases where we can detect collaboration through
intraplay analysis where we could not when attributing the full text.
In the following sections we attribute plays of known or suggested collaboration be-
tween the six original candidate authors as well as two new authors: Robert Greene and
George Peele. The plays used to construct Greene’s and Peele’s profile are listed in Table
11.3. Additionally, we re-train the WAN networks due to the fact that smaller WANS in-
crease the attribution accuracy of shorter texts. This is because shorter texts are less likely
to contain less common function words. As a result, larger networks that contain these less
common function words are more prone to over-fit to features of specific texts rather than
author style. From the training period, we achieve accuracies of 93.4% and 91.5% for acts
and scenes, respectively. Note that in the case of scene attribution, this is the accuracy of bi-
nary attribution, whereas the act attribution is performed between eight candidate authors.
The words used in the resulting networks are listed in Tables 11.4 and 11.5.

paring the two top candidate authors, reflected by both the color of the bars and the titles
above and below the plot. A longer bar in a particular direction indicates a larger difference
between the entropies of the two candidate authors. For example, in Fig. 11.4, red bars
extending upwards indicate an attribution to Shakespeare while blue bars extending down-
wards indicate an attribution to Fletcher. In the attribution of acts, we identify the two top
authors as the two highest ranked, whereas the attribution of scenes we consider the two
authors most often cited as candidates. In many cases, the acts and scenes will be attributed
between the same pair of authors. Cases in which an act is attributed to a third author are
marked in the figure captions.
11.2.1 Jonson and Chapman
We attribute both the individual acts and scenes of the single known collaboration between
Jonson and Chapman, Eastward Ho, which also includes contributions from a third author,
John Marston. Fig. 11.3 displays the results of the act and scene attribution. Every act
82
is assigned to Jonson, with the exception of Act 3 assigned to Shakespeare. Chapman is
ranked either third or forth in all acts except Act 3 in which he is ranked second. These
results are similar to the full play attribution from Figs. 9.1 and 9.3, in which Jonson was
the top ranked author and Chapman was not well ranked. While these results on their own
do not support Chapman’s contribution, a look at the scene attribution does reveal some of
Chapman’s possible contributions. Most of the play is still assigned to Jonson, however
Chapman is seen as a more likely candidate in scene 3.3 and 5.2 whereas the attribution of
scenes 3.1-2 is too close to make any conclusion. While there is not a scholarly consensus
on the scene breakdown, many attribute Marston to Act 1, Chapman to Act 2 and 3, and
Jonson to Act 5 [49]. Most scholars agree in particular about scene 3.3 being written
by Chapman [58]. Our results support the notion that Chapman did not write Act 1 and
Jonson wrote Act 5. We also provide further evidence that Chapman wrote 3.3, as it is, in
our analysis, the single scene that is assigned to Chapman by a margin larger than 2cn. We
also, however, find more evidence of Jonson contributing Acts 2 and 4 than Chapman.

In Fig. 11.4 we show the attribution of individual acts and scenes of Two Noble Kinsmen,
a known collaboration between Shakespeare and Fletcher. Whereas in Fig. 11.2 the play
is assigned to Shakespeare with Fletcher as the second best candidate, here Acts 1 and 5
are assigned to Shakespeare while Acts 2 and 3 are assigned to Fletcher. Act 4 is assigned
to Fletcher with Shakespeare and Jonson close behind. A closer look into the scene break-
down reveals more specific assignments. Shakespeare is assigned to scenes 1.1-4, 2.1,

Figure 11.7: Attribution of acts and scenes of Measure for Measure.
3.1-2, 4.3, 5.1, and 5.3-4, Fletcher is assigned to scenes 1.5, 2.2, 2.4-6, 3.3-6, and 4.1-2,
and close ties in scenes 2.3 and 5.2. The scene breakdown we propose largely supports the
one given by Hallet Smith in The Riverside Shakespeare [67].
The act and scene analysis of Shakespeare and Fletcher’s other collaboration–Henry
VIII–is displayed in Fig. 11.5. Recall that, when attributing the full play, Shakespeare was
the top candidate while Fletcher was in fact ranked fourth, thus revealing no evidence of
collaboration; see Fig. 9.5 or Fig. 11.2. We see similar results in Fig. 11.5, in which
Shakespeare is assigned every act. Fletcher, again, is ranked poorly in every act. A scene-
by-scene analysis between Shakespeare and Fletcher however, does reveal Fletcher to be a
stronger candidate than Shakespeare in several individual scenes. In fact, the scene break-
down we observe–in which Shakespeare is assigned scenes 1.1-2, 2.1-2, 2.4, 3.2, 4.1-2, and
5.1-2 and Fletcher is assigned scenes 1.3-4, 3.1, and 5.4, and 2.3 and 5.3 ties between both
authors–is aligned to that proposed by Cyrus Hoy [61] and currently accepted by many
scholars. The primary area of disparity between the breakdown we propose and the one
85
given by Hoy is the authorship of Act 4. While Hoy assigns Act 4 to Fletcher, we find
that there is greater evidence that Shakespeare contributed this section. Both scenes are at-
tributed to Shakespeare by a significant margin of at least 5cn. Another point of contention
is the assignment of 2.3–given to Shakespeare by Hoy–to Fletcher by a small margin.
The attribution of Henry VIII shows a clear example of using intraplay analysis to detect
collaboration at the level of scenes that may be undetectable when looking at entire plays
or acts. In this play, there are several individual scenes that attribute to Shakespeare by a
margin as wide as 7cn, such as scenes 1.2, 2.4, 4.1, and 5.1, that bias the attribution of
complete acts in favor of Shakespeare, while the scene to scene analysis provides a clearer
perspective.
11.2.3 Shakespeare and Middleton
We analyze in Figs. 11.6-11.8 Middleton’s contributions to Shakespeare’s plays, Macbeth,
Measure for Measure, and Timon of Athens. The attribution of the full plays in Fig. 9.2
did not suggest that Middleton made any significant contribution to any of these plays. The
intraplay analysis of Macbeth at the level of acts and scenes, shown in Figure 11.6, supports
this conclusion. A total of two scenes are assigned to Middleton over Shakespeare, namely
scenes 1.1 and 5.1. Scene 5.1 is attributed to Middleton by only a small margin of 1cnwhile
scene 1.1 is assigned by a more substantial margin of 3cn. Scholars have often flagged
scenes 1.2, 3.5, and 4.1 as scenes revised or contributed by Middleton [56], although we do
not find evidence of this in our analysis.

Middleton
Shakespeare
Figure 11.8: Attribution of acts and scenes of Timon of Athens.
The case of Measure for Measure favors Shakespeare’s sole authorship even more; both
the act and scene analysis displayed in Fig. 11.7 find Shakespeare to be the sole author of
the play. If Middleton had indeed revised the original play as proposed by scholars [56,68],
we do not find evidence it was substantial.
Of the three plays, we find that Middleton’s contribution was likely largest in Timon of
Athens. While all five acts attribute to Shakespeare, in Act 3 it is by a margin less than 1cn
from Middleton; see Fig. 11.8. This is even more evident in the scene analysis. Middleton
is a stronger candidate in scenes 1.2, 3.2, and 3.4, with close ties in scenes 3.1, 3.3, and 4.2.
This assignment supports much of the claim of authorship provided in [56, 60].
11.2.4 Shakespeare and Marlowe
Although there are no unanimously agreed upon collaborations between Shakespeare and
Marlowe, there exist a number of plays with controversial authorship that have been the
subject of scholarly treatment regarding Marlowe’s contributions. Of these, we examine the
87
three parts of Henry VI as well as the anonymous plays Arden of Faversham and Edward
III.
As suggested by the results in Fig. 9.5, the three parts of Henry VI have been considered
as possible collaborations between Shakespeare and Marlowe [57], though others such as
Greene and Peele have also been suggested. The attribution of the acts of 1 Henry VI,
displayed in Fig. 11.9, suggests that Act 1 could have been written by someone other than
Shakespeare. It is here attributed evenly between Shakespeare and Jonson with Marlowe
the next preferred candidate. Although Jonson is generally not considered a candidate for
this play, it may suggest a similar author we do not profile. The rest of the play is assigned
to Shakespeare and, in the case of Acts 3 and 4, by a wide margin from second candidate
Marlowe. The scenes are attributed between Shakespeare and Marlowe. In line with the act
attribution, three scenes in Act 1 (1.1, 1.5-6) attribute to Marlowe rather than Shakespeare.
Other scenes that attribute to Marlowe include 3.2, 3.4, 4.2, 5.1-2. Scene 4.2 in particular
is attributed to Marlowe by a large margin of almost 6cn. These results support parts of the
breakdown suggested by Hugh Craig [57], namely the attribution of someone other than
Shakespeare in Act 1 as well as Shakespeare in scenes 4.3-7. Although Craig contends that
Marlowe likely wrote the scenes involving Joan of Arc, we find only half of the Joan of
Arc scenes (1.5-6, 3.2, 5.2) to be more like Marlowe than Shakespeare.
The act and scene attribution of 2 Henry VI is shown in Fig. 11.10. Act 1 is assigned
to Marlowe and the rest is assigned to Shakespeare, with Act 4 being a close tie between
them. In the former case, Shakespeare is the third candidate author behind Peele. The

Figure 11.11: Attribution of acts and scenes of 3 Henry VI. Note that the relative entropy for scene
4.2 extends out of the view of the figure to +30cn.
89
scene analysis assigns to Marlowe scenes 1.1, 1.4, 2.2, 2.4, 4.1, and close ties in scenes
1.3, 2.3, 4.3-5, and 4.7-8. Scenes 1.1 and 1.4, in particular, attribute to Marlowe by a wider
margin of 4cn, increasing the likelihood of his contribution, while the other two scenes in
Act 1 show less clear indication of authorship. In comparison to the breakdown offered
by Craig, our results support the claims that Shakespeare wrote all of Act 3 and Marlowe
possibly wrote scenes involving Jack Cade’s rebellion (4.3-9). Act 2, on the other hand, is
attributed to Shakespeare in the act analysis but most of the individual scenes are attributed
to Marlowe. The WAN of scene 2.1, in particular, has a large relative entropy to Marlowe’s
profile and indicates a strong likelihood it was written by Shakespeare.
The intraplay analysis of 3 Henry VI in Fig. 11.11 attributes Act 1 to Marlowe and
the rest to Shakespeare. Although Craig has suggested that the part of the text most likely
written by other authors is Act 4, the act analysis alone here suggests otherwise. However,
the attribution of individual scenes shows a different pattern. Here, Marlowe is assigned
four of the eight scenes in Act 4, while Shakespeare is attributed scene 4.3 by a very wide
margin of 30cn–caused by the presence of a rare transition–which likely skewed the entire
act in Shakespeare’s favor. In addition to scenes 2, 5, 7, and 8 in Act 4, Marlowe is selected
as the more likely candidate in scenes 1.1, 2.3-4, 3.3, 5.2, and 5.7. Shakespeare, meanwhile,
is assigned scenes 1.2-4, 2.1-2, ,2.5-6, 3.1-2, 4.3-4, 4.6, 5.1, and 5.3-6. Scene 4.1 is a close
tie between authors.
We also perform in Fig. 11.12 the intraplay analysis on the play Arden of Faversham, at-
tributed to Shakespeare in Fig. 10.1. Every act is attributed here to Shakespeare. Although

not shown in the figure, the second preferred candidate in all acts except Act 5 is Jonson,
who is not typically considered a potential author due to the year it was written. The other
commonly considered candidates for authorship are Thomas Kyd and Marlowe [57, 69].
The former is not profiled due to a lack of a sufficient number of texts to build a profile
and the latter is not well ranked in Acts 1-4 but is close to the second preferred candidate
in Act 5. For this reason, we attribute the scenes between Shakespeare and Marlowe rather
than Shakespeare and Jonson. The scene-by-scene analysis shows Shakespeare as the most
likely candidate for almost the entire play, with many scenes attributed to Shakespeare by
a margin of at least 4cn. The exception to this is scene 5.5, which is assigned to Marlowe,
and scene 5.2, a tie between candidates. Our results support existing claims by MacDonald
P. Jackson [70] that Shakespeare at the very least wrote the middle of the play (Act 3),
however we also find him to be a likely candidate in at least Acts 1, 2, and 4 as well.
An analysis is performed for Edward III, attributed to Shakespeare in Fig. 10.1. As
before, the two most commonly cited candidates for co-authorship with Shakespeare are

Kyd and Marlowe [57, 71]. The act attribution of Edward III in Fig. 11.13 shows Act 1
assigned to Marlowe. Acts 2, 4, and 5 are attributed to Shakespeare, as well as Act 3 by
a small margin of less than 0.5cn. A look into the scene by scene attribution, however,
shows that in addition to 1.1, Marlowe is also assigned scene 3.1 by a clear margin of
2cn. Marlowe is also assigned scenes 4.1 and 4.7-8, while the attribution of scene 1.2
does not provide a clear candidate. While not shown in Fig. 11.13, the relative entropy
values in attribution of scene 4.3 is large between both profiles (+2cn and +6cn between
Shakespeare’s and Marlowe’s profile, respectively), suggesting neither Shakespeare nor
Marlowe, but possibly a third author contributed the scene.
Timothy Irish Watt has suggested that Shakespeare wrote scenes 1.2 and 2.1 while
someone other than Shakespeare, Marlowe, or Peele wrote scenes 3.1-4.3 [57]. Our results
point to Shakespeare as a likely candidate for scene 2.1, with his profile being almost 4cn
closer to the WAN of Edward III than Marlowe’s profile. Additionally, along with scene
4.3, we find scenes 3.2-3 and 4.1-2, 4.5 and 4.9 to be possibly written by a third author due

Shakespeare’s play, Titus Andronicus, is commonly cited to include additions by Peele [60],
and is attributed act by act and scene by scene in Figure 11.14. Act 1 is assigned to Peele
while the rest of the play is attributed to Shakespeare. In the scene attributions scenes
2.1 and 4.4 are attributed to Shakespeare by a small margin of less than 1cn, evidencing

possible contributions of Peele. Typical attributions of this play, such as the one performed
by Brian Vickers [60], assign to Peele Act 1 as well as scenes 2.1 and 4.1.
Another scene of interest in Titus Andronicus in the context of attribution studies is
scene 3.2, also known as the “Fly” scene. This particular scene is present in the 1623 Folio
but not earlier additions, suggesting it was a later addition to the play and possibly added
by another author. The relative entropies for this scene are compared in Table 11.6. The
two top candidates here are Shakespeare and Marlowe. However, the scene only appeared
in editions published long after Marlowe’s death so our top candidate for this scene remains
Shakespeare.

Genre Analysis
Based on the results in Section 6.2, we use WANs to distinguish between plays at the level
of genre. We build three profiles for each of the three primary genres–comedy, tragedy, and
history–using plays that were not written by the six main playwrights studied in this part of
the thesis. The complete list of texts used in the genre profiles is displayed in Table 12.1.
The profiles use at most one play from any particular author to avoid biasing the results
based on author similarity rather than genre similarity.
In Fig. 12.1, the results are shown from the attribution of ten comedy, tragedy, and
history plays between the genre profiles. A total of seven of the ten comedy plays–displayed
to the left of the first red line–correctly attribute to the comedy profile. Note also that all
three misattributions are attributed to the tragedy profile. The attribution of ten tragedy
plays, displayed to the right of the first red line, results in only three plays being assigned
to the tragedy profile, with Hamlet a close three way tie between all profiles. From the

remaining six plays, five are assigned to the comedy profile. However, the attribution of
history plays results in 90% accuracy; shown to the right of the second red line. In our
results, we find that distinguishing between history and the other genres is easier than
distinguishing between comedy and tragedy. This is interesting because it is common to
consider history and tragedy more thematically similar than comedy and tragedy. Our
results, by contrast, suggest that the writing styles of comedy and tragedy are more closely
linked than the writing styles of either comedy and history or tragedy and history.

Conclusion
We presented a novel method to solve closed class authorship attribution problems and to
answer author profiling questions. This method is based on relational data between func-
tion words that we represented using normalized word adjacency networks (WANs). We
interpreted these networks as Markov chains in order to facilitate their comparison using
relative entropies. The accuracy of WANs was analyzed for varying number of candidate
authors, text lengths, profile lengths and different levels of heterogeneity among the can-
didate authors, regarding genre, gender, and time period. The applicability of WANs to
identify multiple authors in collaborative works was also demonstrated. With regards to
existing methods based on the frequency with which different function words appear in
the text, we observed that WANs exceed their classification accuracy. More importantly,
we showed that WANs and frequencies captured different stylometric aspects so that their
combination is possible and ends up halving the error rate of existing methods.

After showing the value of WANs in solving attribution problems, we applied them to
analyze the authorship of texts written by popular playwrights during the Early Modern
English period. The existence of several authorship controversies during that period made
it an attractive dataset for the application of WANs. We validated the method for this dataset
by attributing plays of undisputed authorship. After showing high classification accuracy, a
selection of anonymous plays were attributed among the author profiles. The classification
power was then further evaluated with respect to plays written by multiple authors, both
through the attribution of an entire play as well as its individual act and scene components.
The acts and scenes were individually analyzed in a set of plays with highly disputed co-
authorship, in which we both corroborate existing breakdowns and provide evidence of new
assignments. The influence of genre in the choice of function words was also examined.
