Forensic 
Linguistics
Forensic Linguistics:
language
lawcrime
A field of applied linguistics associated 
with language in the context of law 
and crime
• 1581
• from 
LATIN. forensis "of a 
forum, place of 
assembly," 
Forensic Linguistics:
from forum
• Used in sense of 
"pertaining to legal 
trials," as in forensic 
medicine (1845

Authorship
Attribution
”Authorship attribution, the science of 
inferring characteristics of the author from 
the characteristics of documents written by 
that author, is a problem with a long history 
and a wide range of application (...)”
Authorship attribution
(Encyclopædeia Britannica) 
• Has been a topic of research since at least 
mod-19th century (predates computers)
• Interest in
– resolving issues of disputed authorship
– identifying authorship of anonymous texts
Authorship attribution
– may be useful in detecting plagiarism, and 
authorship of computer viruses
– used in forensic setting, eg to detect genuine 
confessions
Joseph 
Rudman
Authorship attribution
”(...)every author has a verifiably 
unique style(...)”
”two individuals of the same generation 
and locality, speaking precisely the 
same dialect (...) are never absolutely 
at one in their speech habits”
Edward 
Sapir
Authorship attribution:  
”any attempt 
to infer the characteristics of the creator 
of a piece of linguistic data”
Authorship attribution
Patrick 
Juola
”Authorship attribution, broadly defined, is one of the oldest 
and one of the newest problems in information retrieval. 
Disputes about the ownership of words have been around for 
as long as words themselves could be owned. Questions of 
authenticating documents have existed as long as the 
Stylometry:
documents themselves have. And the question “what can I 
tell about a person from the language he uses” has been 
around since, literally, the days of the Old Testament (...)”

Authorship attribution methods
Physical evidence
– eg carbon dating and handwriting analysis, as in case 
Attribution methods:
of Hitler Diaries. Not relevant to linguistics/stylistics
Historical evidence
– eg did Marlowe or Shakespeare write Edward III? It 
was published 1596, 3 yrs after Marlowe’s death, but 
contains references to the defeat of the Armada 
Attribution methods:
(1588)
– “knowledge intensive”, not feasible for computers
Cipher-based decryption (i.e: Da Vinci Code Hokum, 
pseudosiceince)
– idea that authors deliberately encode their names in 
text
– especially widespread in Bible studies, but also in 
Shakespeare-Bacon debate
Attribution methods:
– Penn (1987) used computer analysis to show Bacon had 
written a lot of Shakespeare’s plays
– easily debunked: see 
http://shakespeareauthorship.com/#5b: Ross showed 
that using the same techniques “proved” that bacon 
also wrote Spenser’s Faerie Queene, the Bible, Caesar’s 
Gallic Wars, Hiawatha, Moby Dick and The Federalist 
Papers (see later)
Manual analysis
– Much used in forensic linguistics
Attribution methods:
– Detailed analysis of unlimited linguistic traits
– Not suitable for computational analysis, but 
we’ll look at some examples later
Computational stylometry
– Involves counting things
Attribution methods:
– So can only look at what is easily countable

Use and Abuse;
Fame and 
Infamy
• Did Homer write both the Illiad and the Odyssey?
– both generally attributed to a single individual named “Homer”, 
but both are derived from long oral tradition
• Did Paul write all the NT Letters of St Paul? 
– Especially, the authorship of Hebrews has long been debated on 
theological grounds
Contesting the Classics:
• Plato developed his philosophy in the form of dialogues, putting his 
own doctrines into the mouth of Socrates his teacher. 
– Ascertaining the correct chronological order of these dialogues 
would help to understand how Plato developed his philosophy
• Did Shakespeare write all of his plays?
“Shakespeare” may even be nom-de-plume for a group of writers
Authorship of 
William 
Shakespeare’s works 
has often been 
attributed to Edward 
de Vere, Francis 
Bacon, Christopher 
Contesting the Classics:
Marlowe, and 
William Stanley. No 
actual scientific 
inquiry into the 
matter has been 
conducted. 
The Publius Penname
• The Federalist Papers
– a series of articles published in 
1787-88 with the aim of 
promoting the ratification of 
the new US constitution.  
– written by three authors, Jay, 
Hamilton and Madison, under 
the pseudonym “Publius”
– Some are of known (and in 
some cases joint) authorship 
but others are disputed
The Publius Penname
– Pioneering stylometric 
methods were famously used 
by Mosteller and Wallace in 
the early 1960s to attempt to 
answer this question
– The Federalist Papers present 
a difficult but solvable test 
case, and are seen as  a 
benchmark to test new ideas
85 articles 
The authorship 
of 73 is clear
The Publius Penname
12 are disputed

• Similarities with private letters helped 
to identify the style of the 
Unabomber’s manifesto
– Unabomber Theodore Kaczynski 
perpetrated a number of bomb 
attacks on universities and 
airlines between 1978 and 1995
– Promised to stop if his 35,000-
word anti-industrialist 
“manifesto” was published in 
major newspapers
The Unabomber
– Distinctive writing style and turns 
of phrase enabled him to be 
identified (he used idiosyncratic 
punctuation and capitalisation on 
damaged typewriter)
• Authorship of Primary Colors, a work 
of fiction about preparations for the 
Democratic primaries which showed 
the Bill Clinton character in a bad 
light
Derek Bentley and his disputed murder ‘confession’ 
(1953)
Bentley (an illiterate man of low IQ) and another 
man involved in an armed robbery in which a 
policeman was shot
Bentley found guilty and hanged in January 1953
In 1971 author Yallop looked closely at the case, 
As well as conflicting ballistic evidence, and some 
procedurtal errors in the trial, Bentley’s 
statement was found to have been doctored by 
police:
Derek Bentley
Contested statement used then every 58 words on 
average and repeatedly used I then.
BoE uses then every 500 words, and then I ten 
times more often than I then.  Importantly, 
witness statement frequencies overall are 
similar to BoE.
Police statement ‘genre’ of the time used then 
every 78 words, and typically used the I then
form.
Derek Bentley acquitted in 1999, posthumously, 
appeal assisted by a linguistics professor
Stylometry beyond attribution:
Authorship Obfuscation
•Concealing one’s own or someone elses style (making a text 
stylistically neutral)
Further Potential Uses:
•Authorship imitation for non-malicious purposes (pastiche, 
parody etc.)
Internet Filters 
•such as Bayesian Spam Filters (see Sahemi et al., 1998.)
Counter-obfuscation
•Determining who wrote it  when this information is 
supposed to be confidential
Potential for Abuse:
Stylometry beyond attribution:
Authorship Imitation
•Mimicking someone elses style for illegal or ethially 
questionable purposes, such as planting false evidence in 
court cases or when explicit copyright infringement is 
involved

Stylometric Methods of
Authorship attribution
• Measurement of (aspects) of style Especially using 
computational tools
• Purposes:
– Genre classification 
Stylometry:
– Historical study of language change (diachronic linguistics)
– Literary analysis
– Authorship attribution
– Forensic linguistics
Stylometry vs. Authorship Attribution: what 
is the diffrence?
Stylometry is the method, or set of 
Stylometry:
methods, of authorship attribution, which is 
the goal.
It is a means vs. end relation
1966 – Erdman and Fogel propose to attribute authorship by 
both internal (content) and external (letters and 
contemporary testimony) features.
Timeline:
Stylometry:
1964 – Mosteller and Wallace study the Federalist Papers, 
attributing the authorship of the disputed papers to Madison.
• Assumes that the essence of the individual style of an 
author can be captured with reference to a number of 
quantitative criteria, called discriminators
• Obviously, some (many) aspects of style are conscious 
and deliberate 
– as such they can be easily imitated and indeed often 
Stylometry:
are
– many famous pastiches, either humorous or as a sort 
of homage
• Computational stylometry is focused on subconscious 
elements of style less easy to imitate or falsify
All methods are, to a greater or lesser extent, statistical 
(unlike traditional attribution)
All take advantage of corpora
Stylometry:
Methods range from simple word counts to complex 
algorithms, like like those that implement Machine Learning 
(Neural Networks, Markov Chains etc.)
Personal observation:
The complexity of a given method 
Stylometry:
is not directly proportionate to its efficacy.
In other words:
Sometimes, simply skimming through a 
Stylometry:
text will tell one more than processing it 
with complex mathematical modelling.
Stylometry:
Major drawbacks of stylometric authorship attribution:
– Discriminators are mostly lexical, though some recent work has looked 
also at syntactic discriminators (requires annotation)
– Authors’ styles change, either over time, or deliberately, eg when 
writing in different literary genres (an author’s change of makes, de-
facto, a new author)
– Many techniques rely on large quantities of data (i.e. over 65000 words 
to be reliably accurate)
Most of the following techniques are better at dealing with closed questions:
– Who wrote this, A or B?
– If A wrote these, did they also write this?
– How likely is it that A wrote this?
– but not Who wrote this?
• Word or sentence length too obvious and 
easy to manipulate
• Frequencies of letter pairs strangely 
Stylometry:
Additional points to consider:
successful, though limited
• Distribution of words of a given length (in 
syllables), especially relative frequencies, ie 
length of gaps between words of same 
syllable length.

Mosteller and Wallace’s Approach
• Mosteller and Wallace (1964) employed function words 
such as prepositions, conjunctions, and articles as 
discriminators.
Stylometry:
– e.g., the word upon averaged 3.24 appearances per 1,000 words 
in the known writings of Hamilton but only 0.23 in the writings of 
Madison
– 30 “marker words” identified as discriminativeof the two 
contested authors: upon, whilst, there, on, while, vigor, by, 
consequently, would, voice
Bayesian probability
• Bayes hypothesis reconciles prior hypotheses (in this 
case based on historical observation) with conditional 
probabilities based on measurements
• If prior hypothesis (eg that there is a 1:3 chance that 
Stylometry:
Madison wrote the paper) is confirmed by the 
measurements (eg of features associated with 
Madison’s style), the result will be neutral
• If prior hypothesis is contradicted by the 
measurements, result will imply additional research
Bayesian probability
Stylometry:
More formally, Bayesian inference uses Bayes' formula for conditional probability:
Where:
•H is a hypothesis, and D is the data.
•P(H) is the prior probability of H: the probability that H is correct before the data 
D was seen.
•P(D | H) is the conditional probability of seeing the data D given that the 
hypothesis H is true. P(D | H) is called the likelihood.
•P(D) is the marginal probability of D.
•P(H | D) is the posterior probability: the probability that the hypothesis is true, 
given the data and the previous state of belief about the hypothesis.
Cumulative sum charts (CUSUM)
– Assume authorial “fingerprints” such as percentage of short words, or 
words beginning with a vowel
– Put two texts together and plot the number of items per sentence against 
the cumulative average
– If graph has a sharp divergence at the point where the texts are joined, this 
shows the authors differ
• Highly controversial
Stylometry:
– Interpretation of graphs very subjective
– But much used in courts!
• Weighted cusum
– Slightly sounder footing statistically – eliminates need for subjective 
judgment
– Still not very accurate compared to other measures
Cumulative sum charts (CUSUM)
Stylometry:
As its name implies, CUSUM involves the calculation of a 
cumulative sum (which is what makes it "sequential"). Samples 
from a process xn are assigned weights ωn, and summed as 
follows:
S = 00
Sn + 1 = max(0,Sn + xn − ωn)
When the value of S exceeds a certain threshold value, a change 
in value has been found. 
Multivariate analysis
• Thanks to computers it is now possible to collect 
large numbers of different measurements, of a 
variety of features 
• Variants of multivariate analysis
Stylometry:
– Cluster analysis
– Correspondence analysis
– Principal components analysis
Correspondence analysis
• Example of superlatives in 
Dickens’ and Smollett’s 
works 
– Tabata 2007: 
http://www.digitalhumanities.org/dh2007/
abstracts/xhtml.xq?id=259)
• Count frequency of 242 
Stylometry:
superlatives in 30 texts
• CA allows classification of 
associations between 
variables in a 2d matrix, 
rows x columns
• D1 distinguishes Dickens 
from Smollett
• D2 
Cluster analysis
• Group objects according to their similarity with 
respect to a given feature
• Produces a tree diagram or “dendogram”
Stylometry:
Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
PCA is a method statistical analysis that 
simply rotates the underlying data space in 
Stylometry:
order to create a new set of axes that 
capture the most variance in the data. It is 
meant to be maximally informative.
Stylometry:
Principal components analysis
Principal components analysis
• Like cluster analysis but can 
work with much larger range 
of variables
• PCA is a statistical method 
for arranging large arrays of 
data into interpretable 
patterning match
Stylometry:
• “principal components” are 
computed by calculating the 
correlations between all 
the variables, then grouping 
them into sets that show the 
most correspondence
• each “set” is a “component”, 
or “dimension”
Linear distribution:
Inspired by, and hence simmilar to, DNA testing (such as paternity tests)
Stylometry:
Vector spaces
A vector space is a mathematical structure 
formed by a collection of vectors: objects 
that may be added together and multiplied 
Stylometry:
("scaled") by numbers, called scalars in this 
context.

Conclusions
What are the implications of recent research?
Although the existence of several so-called writeprints
and writer invariants has been the subject of intense 
speculation, there is no scientific evidence for their 
existence
Large training corpora seem to be a key factor in 
Conclusions:
increasing the accuracy of stylometric attribution methods
An accurate framework needs to be established if 
stylometry is to become a full-fledged forensic discipline; at 
this time, too many contradictory solutions have been 
propounded
Questions?
Which discriminators are more accurate: lexical or 
functional? Which should become the focus of study? 
Conclusions:
How advantageous would syntactic annotation be when it 
comes to authorship attribution?
Are typological features a factor in the accuracy of 
attribution methods (stylometric in particular)? If so then to 
what extent? Which of them could become potential 
discriminators?
