ABSTRACT
The corpora for this study are from News Co-broadcasting, Daily Conversations and Behind
the headlines with Wentao, each of which represents the formal written style, the colloquial
style and the conversational style respectively. Sentence length, word length, part of speech
(POS) and sentence-initial word POS are selected from the pre-processed corpora as features
to generate text vectors and then clustered with PAM (partition around medoids) and Ward
algorithms. The clustering results show: (1) It is reasonable to select sentence length, word
length, POS and sentence-initial word POS as Chinese quantitative stylistic features. (2)
Style is a polarized continuum, as the formal written style and the colloquial style display
bipolar distributions while the conversational style lies in between and is near the pole of
the colloquial style.
1. INTRODUCTION
This article concerns the viability of sentence length, word length, and part
of speech as Chinese stylistic features and the relations between different
Chinese styles.
1.1 Style and Category
Style, as its name implies, is a speaking mode. It is the manner or structural
system of utterance communication, referring to the principles and rules gen-
erated in communication and followed by the speaker and listener, the essence
of which is to adjust the psychological distance between the communicators

(Feng, 2010). Shaping in a certain context, style is the antecedence and desti-
nation of linguistic performance. Style and linguistic performance are interde-
pendent and cannot be tenable without each other as style is produced and
shaped in linguistic performance and, in return, the system of style and its
rules regulate linguistic performance once they are formulated. There are no
utterances which cannot be categorized into any style, but only utterances
with improper style. To some extent, the research of stylistic features and rules
amounts to that of the governing rules behind linguistic performance, which
may contribute to the guidance of actual linguistic performance. To generate
natural and fluent utterance, it is necessary to follow stylistic rules.
There is no agreement on the classification of style. The essential features
of style involve three factors, i.e. context, linguistic materials and fixed
ways of expressing the objects, the combination of which construct a dis-
course. The number of styles in a language is extremely limited due to the
generality of the typology of context, the systematic differentiation of lan-
guage materials and the technicality of the special ways of expressing the
objects. Different researchers have different opinions on the classification of
style from different perspectives. According to Wang and Chen (2000),
style can be divided into conversational and written style, in which the writ-
ten style is subdivided into the artistic and the practical style, the latter
include scientific, official, report and political styles. Wang’s classification is
discrete, without mentioning the relations between these six styles. Feng
(2010) thinks that style is generated in direct interpersonal communication;
it is created through the identification of mutual relation between speaker
and listener in communication; the three factors of style are communicative
object, place and contents. The basic types of communication are the rou-
tine type and non-routine type, in which formality is the primary element of
style. Therefore, the difference between these two categories rests on the
degree of formality, i.e. formality widens the distance while informality nar-
rows the distance between communicators (Feng, 2003). Style is of binary
opposition. On the one hand, mutually exclusive styles, e.g. formality and
informality, elegance and popularity, are opposite to each other. On the
other hand, as formality, as well as elegance, has different levels in degree,
style may be either at one of the two poles of a continuum, or somewhere
in between the two poles. From our perspective, style is nothing about qual-
ity but something about quantity. Stylistic features are summarised on the
basis of quantitative statistics of linguistic elements. Though some linguistic
elements may have fixed stylistic characteristics, most of them can occur in
different stylistic contexts with different occurrences. From this, it is clear

that different styles are not entirely distinct from each other; instead, they
may share some common features in certain aspects. It needs mentioning
that this paper only focuses on formality of style while elegancy of style is
not taken into account. Style must exist in the form of bipolarity which, as
we think, stands for the formal written style and the daily-colloquial style.
Any style of verbal communication lies in either of the two poles or
between them for non-stylistic verbal communication cannot possibly occur.
1.2 Research Question and Conclusion
With the help of some stylistic linguistic means, people involved in a verbal
communication can construct a type of stylistic discourse by means of cer-
tain expressions mixed with large amount of other neutral linguistic materials
according to a certain context. The use of a linguistic means has its inevita-
bility and contingency, which can be described with statistical probability in
mathematics. Therefore, style can be measured through a quantitative analy-
sis approach which is more objective and scientific in explaining linguistic
features of style. The uses of different linguistic means indicate statistical
differences in quantity, i.e. style is caused by the differences of the usage fre-
quencies of linguistic elements. Thus the law of the emergency of linguistic
elements becomes the primary basis of stylistic analysis. Through the statis-
tics of linguistic structural features from different stylistic texts, some consis-
tency features can be educed. Thus the distributed data of linguistic
structures become quantitative features representing stylistic laws (Huang &
Liu, 2009). These are the theoretical basis and rules for us to research style
with quantitative method. Also these data provide mathematical supports for
classifying the textual stylistic categories and observing the relations
between styles. Some linguistic elements exhibit different occurring frequen-
cies in different texts. Therefore, it is necessary to resort to quantitative anal-
ysis to ascertain the distributed laws and the feature of frequency, which
makes stylistic features more clearly exhibited in linguistic forms.
The problem of clustering is about partitioning a given data-set into
groups (clusters) such that the data points in a cluster are more similar to
each other than the points in different clusters (Guha, Rastogi, & Shim,
1998). Text clustering is concerned with the characteristics of clustering sta-
tistical analysis – you know nothing about the numbers and structures of
the groups, but you are to arrange data objects into proper groups only
according to the information concerning the objects and their relations in
data (Manning & Schütze, 1999). The similarities and dissimilarities

between objects become the basis of clustering. Those objects with closer
distance are classified into one class.
This paper sets out to test whether some linguistic features can be consid-
ered as stylistic features of Chinese texts and the relations between different
styles which are formal, colloquial and conversational. We select three cor-
pora, each of which represents a different style, extract data based on the pro-
posed stylistic features from the each corpus and cluster analysing these data.
The clustering results show that sentence length, word length, POS and
initial-word POS are viable stylistic indictors for Chinese texts and style is
a polarized continuum, as the formal written style and the colloquial style
display bipolar distributions.
1.3 Related Literature
Köhler (2012) points out that the successes of modern natural sciences all
derive from their instruments and their modern models. This implies that
these instruments and models, of which the quantitative parts of mathemat-
ics (probability theory and statistics, function theory, differential equations)
are indispensible ingredients, are worth integrating into linguistics.
Quantitative analysis applied to linguistic research was first adopted by
the English mathematician De Morgan in 1851. With word length taken as
statistical features, he conducted a quantitative research on style of text.
Markov and Zipf made great contributions to the quantitative study of lan-
guage, and Yule marked a starting point of using modern statistics in quan-
titative stylistic research (Tuldava, 2005; Liu, 2009). Many studies give
good evidence to show that the distributed differences of linguistic struc-
tures in different styles are objective (Biber, 1988; Stamatatos, Fakotakis, &
Kokkinakis, 2001; Cortina-Borja & Chappas, 2006; Swales, 2010; Suzuki,
Kawamura, & Aizawa, 2012). Compared with the research abroad, the
quantitative feature studies of styles of Chinese texts involve the study on
the Harry Potter series (Chen, 2007), the study on “reading news” and
“saying news” from the perspective of quantitative linguistics (Hou, 2010),
the study of Chinese quantitative stylistic features based on corpus (Huang,
2007), the comparative study on reading the news and saying the news (Liu
& Hu, 2011), language model adaptation based on the classification of a tri-
gram’s language style feature (Liang & Zheng, 2006), etc.
To the best of our knowledge, former research on quantitative linguistic
features and text clustering mainly focuses on selecting different linguistic
elements as vector features for text clustering and examining the clustering
results to improve feature selection and clustering algorithm. Feature

selection is the premise of text clustering and classification. For instance,
Zhao, Liu, and Li (2007) propose a text clustering approach based upon
textual themes; Meng and Hou (2009) select discourse markers as vector
features to classify texts; Huang and Liu (2009) apply linguistic quantitative
study results to text clustering to improve the clustering effect; Gao and
Feng (2011) construct text vectors for clustering based on word class
dependency relations.
Different from previous studies, this paper focuses on bringing text clus-
tering into linguistic quantitative study and making it a good tool to help
determine Chinese quantitative stylistic features with statistical data and the-
oretical support.
1.4 Discussion Structure
The remainder of this paper is composed of three parts. Firstly we select
different texts to construct the corpora and introduce the clustering methods.
Secondly we cluster the data extracted from the corpora based on the pro-
posed features and analyse the clustering results. Finally we summarize our
ideas, experiments and draw conclusions.
2. CORPORA CONSTRUCTION AND CLUSTERING
ALGORITHM
Style is comparative in nature.1 That is to say, style presumes the compara-
tive relation implicitly. Only by comparison can it be called the features of
language used in different styles and the quantitative features of style. We
think that it meets the principles of linguistics proposed by Saussure who
held that language exists because of the comparison in it and all the ele-
ments in language should be studied comparatively although in Course in
General Linguistics what he studied was Langue instead of Parole.
2.1 Corpora Selection and Text Vector Construction
Based on the considerations above, we selected three different stylistic texts
to construct the corpora: News Co-broadcasting, Daily Conversations and
Behind the headlines with Wentao.

The TV programme News Co-broadcasting mainly gives a brief introduc-
tion to important state policies and events taking place at home and abroad.
In a sense, it is something of an official document, functioning as leading
the public opinions and delivering governmental policies. It is characterized
by the formal, serious and solemn use of language. News Co-broadcasting
is a formal written style (Huang, 2007; Hou, 2010; Liu & Hu, 2011).
Daily Conversations are routine conversations taking place in some con-
versational scenes such as hospitals, banks, restaurants, bookshops, airports,
classrooms and so on. It is a kind of casual daily conversation, belonging
to daily colloquial style.
In Behind the headlines with Wentao, the host discusses some current hot
issues together with guests. They talk freely, chatting so as to deliver recre-
ational information, create fun and discriminate truth from falsehood, not
focusing on the “right answers” to the issues. The host plays the role of
guiding the invited guests to show their bold individualities in order to cre-
ate an easy and amusing conversational atmosphere.
The materials in the News Co-broadcasting corpus are obtained from the
Language Resources Monitoring and Research Centre. Textual materials in
the Behind the Headlines with Wentao corpus, are collected from the web-
site of Phoenix Satellite TV. Textual materials in the Daily Conversations
corpus are from the conversational discourses collected by the Computa-
tional Linguistics Laboratory of Tsinghua University. The capacity of each
corpus is approximately equal.
ICTCLAS is used for Chinese text segmentation and part-of-speech tag-
ging. ICTCLAS has been known as a Chinese lexical analysis system cre-
ated by the Institute of Computing Technology of the Chinese Academy of
Science, which has a high accuracy of 97.58%, with an over 90% recall for
the recognition of unknown words based on role tagging and a recall of
about 98% for the recognition of Chinese names.2
The MultiLingual Text Processor developed by Professor Mingzhe Jin
from Doshisha University of Japan is applied to calculate the occurrence
frequency of linguistic features which include word length, sentence length,
part of speech and the sentence-initial word POS. Text vectors characterized
by linguistic features are then constructed.

2.2 Clustering Algorithms Choice
The Euclidean distance and the Kullback-Leibler divergence (relative
entropy) are adopted to calculate the similarities between text vectors. The
Kullback–Leibler divergence measures the difference between two probabil-
ity distributions within the same event space and is a non-symmetric mea-
sure of the difference between two probability distributions P and Q.
Specifically, the Kullback–Leibler divergence of Q from P, as shown in
Formula (1), is a measure of the information lost when Q is used to approx-
imate P: KL measures the expected number of extra bits required to code
samples from P when using a code based on Q, rather than using a code
based on P.
The improved relative entropy calculation method is adopted in cluster-
ing, as shown in Formula (2).

We cluster analyse the text vectors characterized by different linguistic fea-
tures so as to examine whether there are significant differences in terms of
some linguistic features. From the distance between the clusters we can see
the relations between the styles. In other words, clustering analysis is our
approach instead of our purpose. Our purpose is not to improve the effec-
tiveness of text clustering by selecting the different algorithms or to com-
pare the differences among different algorithms, but to extract the
quantitative stylistic features by clustering. To lessen the contingency, this
paper chooses partitional clustering and hierarchical clustering to realize
mutual authentication between clustering results. We think these two algo-
rithms are enough to verify our conclusion. There is therefore no need to
choose other clustering algorithms.
Partitional clustering attempts to directly decompose the data-set into a
set of disjoint clusters. The objective of algorithms is to minimize the dis-
tance of the objects within a cluster from the representative point of this
cluster. More specifically, they attempt to determine an integer number of
partitions that optimize a certain criterion function. The criterion function
may emphasize the local or global structure of the data and its optimization
is an iterative procedure (Halkidi, Batistakis, & Vazirgiannis, 2001).

Hierarchical clustering proceeds successively by either merging smaller
clusters into larger ones, or by splitting larger clusters. The result of the
algorithm is a tree of clusters, called a dendrogram, which shows how the
clusters are related. They are more efficient in handling noise and outliers
than partitional clustering. By cutting the dendrogram at a desired level, a
clustering of the data items into disjoint groups is obtained (Halkidi et al.,
2001). This can be seen as the relation between hierarchical and partitional
clustering and the reason that they are selected in this paper.
For partitional clustering, K-means and PAM (partitioning around med-
oids) are commonly used algorithms. The similarity of the two clustering
results from these two algorithms shows that they are appropriate to our
research (see Figure 1 and 2). We select PAM. For the same reason, we
select Ward from hierarchical clustering algorithms.
For stylistic characteristics, we use R language to implement clustering
algorithms and Microsoft Excel to draw their distribution diagrams.
Visual graphics have been applied to show the clustering results. Through
the check of the correspondence of cluster label and class label, it can be
measured to what extent the manual classification process can be automati-
cally realized through text clustering. Moreover, the distribution line charts
are drawn to show the distribution differences of language elements from
various styles. Visual graphics of clustering results and the line charts of

linguistic elements make the analysis clearer and the conclusion more
intuitive.
2.3 Cluster Validation
Since clustering algorithms discover clusters, which are not known a priori,
irrespective of the clustering methods, the final partition of data requires
some sort of evaluation in most applications (Rezaee, Lelieveldt, & Reiber,
1998). Almost every kind of clustering algorithm can find the clusters in
the data-set even if there are no natural clusters in them. For example, clus-
tering the random generated data will produce some clusters. We know that
the clusters are not significant. So we need the cluster validity to validate
the clusters produced by the clustering algorithm. In this paper we select
external and internal criteria to validate the clusters characterized by stylistic
features. The external criteria evaluates the clustering results based on a
pre-specified structure, which is imposed on a data-set and reflects our intui-
tion about the clustering structure of the data-set. The internal criteria
approach aims to evaluate the clustering result of an algorithm using only
quantities and features inherent to the data-set. We adopt the cophenetic cor-
relation coefficient (CPCC) and silhouette coefficient to internally validate
the hierarchical and partitional clustering results respectively.

CPCC is a statistical index to measure the degree of similarity between
cophenetic matrix and proximity matrix. The cophenetic matrix can repre-
sent the hierarchy diagram produced by a hierarchical clustering algorithm.
The element of cophenetic matrix, which is the cophenetic distance between
two vectors, represents the proximity level at which the two vectors are
found in the same cluster for the first time.
The silhouette coefficient takes into account the cluster cohesion and sep-
aration. For a given data point i in the cluster A, its silhouette coefficient si
is defined as follows:
Si ¼ ðbi  aiÞ=maxðai; biÞ:
where, ai is the average distance between point i and all other points in A,
bi is the minimum value among the average distances between point i and
all points in every cluster to which point i does not belong.
The silhouette coefficient is between −1 and 1. The average of all silhou-
ette coefficients of all the points in the cluster is called the average silhou-
ette coefficient of that cluster. The average of all silhouette coefficients of
all clusters, which evaluate the total clusters validity, is called the average
silhouette width for all points in the data-set.
3. CLUSTERING EXPERIMENTS
3.1 Sentence Length as the Clustering Feature
Sentence length is an important linguistic feature. Long sentences are infor-
mative and rigorous while short sentences or phrases are crisp and lively
(Wu, 2001). As a sentence is defined as a word sequence ended with a full
stop, a question mark or an exclamation mark, sentence length is the num-
ber of words contained in it. We establish textual vectors with sentence
length for clustering. Examining the clustering results can determine
whether there is a significant difference in sentence length usage between
News Co-broadcasting, Daily Conversation and Behind the headlines with
Wen Tao and whether sentence length can be used as quantitative stylistic
feature. By investigating the distances between clusters, we can judge the
relations between the different styles.
With sentence length as clustering feature, the similarities between textual
vectors can be presented with the Euclidean distance which symbolize
lower similarity with longer distance. PAM algorithm and Ward algorithm

are used to cluster the textural vectors. The clustering results are shown in

and the Euclidean distance divides well the three types of texts into
corresponding categories which is consistent with the texts types intuitively.
Farther distance can be seen between Daily Conversation and News
Co-broadcasting, but Behind the headlines with Wen Tao is comparatively
close to News Co-broadcasting and far away from Daily Conversation, or
say in a sense that it lies in between them. The average silhouette coeffi-
cients of the clusters are 0.4, 0.18, 0.53 respectively and the average silhou-
ette width is 0.37 which is greater than zero. From the silhouette
coefficients we see that the clusters are significant and valid. Thus, the dis-
tinction of sentence length is significant between them. Sentence length can
be seen as the distinguishing feature. In addition, the distance between clus-
ters show that Behind the headlines with Wen Tao lies in between Daily
Conversation and News Co-broadcasting and is closer to the latter.
In the hierarchical cluster dendrogram shown in Figure 4, the leaf node
represents the text, and the similarity between texts can be measured by the
height of their common ancestor. If the common ancestor is on the root, the
similarity between two texts will be lowest. Non-leaf nodes represent text
categories, and the similarity between the categories is measured by the
height of their common ancestor, the higher the common ancestor, the lower
the degree of similarity, and vice versa. The common ancestor height repre-
sents the distance between the two texts or two categories (the same below).
It can be seen from Figure 4 that the clustering result of texts, character-
ized as sentence length, is better. Texts in News Co-broadcasting (marked
as xwlb, similarly hereinafter), Behind the headlines with Wen Tao (marked
as q, similarly hereinafter) and Daily Conversation (marked as dh, similarly
hereinafter) are clustered into three correspondingly categories with distin-
guishing differences. These three types of texts are clustered individually,
and the intra-cluster differences are much smaller than the extra-cluster dif-
ferences, which show that the three stylistic texts have obvious differences
in terms of sentence length. The CPCC of this hierarchical clustering den-
drogram is 0.786, showing that this clustering result is not the artefact of
the Ward algorithms but the reflection of texts data. Figure 4 shows there is
the largest difference between News Co-broadcasting and Daily Conversa-
tion, and the distance between Behind the headlines with Wen Tao and
News Co-broadcasting is shorter than that between Behind the headlines
with Wen Tao and Daily Conversation. In terms of sentence length, the con-
versational style lies in between the other two styles and is closer to the for-
mal written style which is relevant to the conversational scenes of Behind
the headlines with Wen Tao.

We select the multi-dimensional scaling to reduce dimension and the par-
tition visualization to display the dendrogram in order to make the relations
between the styles more intuitive, as shown in Figure 5.
The partitional clustering result is consistent with the hierarchical cluster-
ing result, indicating that the sentence length difference between them is
not incidental.
From the clustering results we can see that there is a significant differ-
ence in the occurrence frequencies of sentence length among three stylistic
texts. To determine what the difference is, further analysis proceeds. By
summarizing the texts of three styles and calculating the percentages of sen-
tences of every length, a distribution graph of sentence length occurrence
frequency is generated, as is shown in Figure 6.
We can see from Figure 6 that the difference of sentence length distribu-
tions among the three styles is obvious. The distribution line of Daily Con-

percentages decline. Behind the headlines with Wen Tao reaches the maxi-
mum value when the sentence length equals 2 and 3, and the sentence per-
centages decline with the increase of sentence length greater than 3, but the
declining curve is comparatively gentle in contrast to that of Daily
Conversation. For News Co-broadcasting, its percentages increase to some

extent and reach the maximum value and then begin to decrease with the
increase of sentence length. As for those sentences less than 10 words, the
percentage of these sentences is 34.9% in Behind the headlines with Wen
Tao, 7.7% in News Co-broadcasting and 77.7% in the Daily Conversation.
From that, the occurrence of the sentences of 1–9 words is higher in Behind
the headlines with Wen Tao than that in News Co-broadcasting, but lower
than that in Daily Conversation, or in other words, it is “in the middle”. As
for those sentences of sentence length greater than 15 but less than and
equal to 40, Behind the headlines with Wen Tao is still “in the middle”. As
for those sentences containing more than 40 words, the percentage of them
is zero in Daily Conversation but of almost the same in News Co-broad-
casting and Behind the headlines with Wen Tao. As for those sentences con-
taining more than 55 words, the percentage of them in Behind the headlines
with Wen Tao is slightly higher than that in News Co-broadcasting.
This is to show that News Co-broadcasting tends to use sentences with a
length of between 10 to 40 words, due to that TV news, in order to deliver
more information within limited words and in limited time, sometimes has
to add more extra linguistic components to sentences, or use more modifiers
and complex sentences. Therefore, the sentences become relatively longer
(Li, 2007). Furthermore, the formal written style tries to use some grammat-
ical means to widen the distance with daily colloquialism, e.g. verb-object
constructions are converted into object-verb constructions and preposition-
object-verb constructions, which also leads to the sentences becoming

longer (Feng, 2010). Daily Conversation tends to use sentences of less than
10 words due to the interaction between communicators and the dependence
of conversations on linguistic environment for the participants engaged in
conversations are difficult to have enough time to weigh every word and
have to choose phrases or sentences with simple structure which are also
suitable for the exchange of brief thoughts for its conciseness and direct
delivery of information. Even if communicators want to pass on complex
thoughts, they seldom use long sentences as far as possible. Instead, they
often use short sentences to express compound thoughts. In Behind the
headlines with Wen Tao, those sentences within 10 words are nearly 35%,
those between 10–50 words are nearly 45% and those longer than 50 words
also account for a certain portion, showing that the sentence length distribu-
tion is comparatively looser.
To sum up, sentence length can be perceived as a linguistic feature to
distinguish News Co-Broadcasting, Behind the headlines with Wen Tao and
Daily Conversation. There are significant differences in the usage of sen-
tence length among them. Furthermore, Behind the headlines with Wen Tao
lies in between the other two styles and is closer to News Co-broadcasting.
The distribution line chart of sentence length verifies the clustering results
and represents the characteristics of sentence length occurrence in different
stylistic texts.
3.2 Word Length as the Clustering Feature
Word length is an important means to depict style. Chinese word length
refers to the number of Chinese characters in a word. Generally speaking,
long words are usually complex or obscure. The longer the words are, the
more formal the discourse is. Formal written style tends to utilize complex
words to represent a high level of formality and to achieve an accurate
meaning (Chen, 2008).
The word length threshold is set as 9 to generate text vectors. We select
the Euclidean distance to calculate the degree of similarity between the vec-
tors and the PAM algorithm to cluster text vectors, and the clustering results
are as follows in Figure 7 and Table 1.
Figure 7 shows that an overlap exists between Behind the headlines with
Wen Tao and Daily Conversation and News Co-broadcasting is clustered into
one cluster and far away from the others. Table 1 shows that three texts are
clustered into corresponding categories of each other, indicating a closer dis-
tance between Behind the headlines with Wen Tao and Daily Conversation.
Moreover, Figure 7 shows both of them are far from News Co-broadcasting

while Daily Conversation is a little far from News Co-broadcasting. This sug-
gests that there is a difference between News Co-broadcasting and the others
in terms of the word length; but Behind the headlines with Wen Tao is similar
to Daily Conversation and also lies in between the others. The average silhou-
ette coefficients of cluster 1, 2 and 3 are 0.83, 0.60 and 0.64 respectively and
the average silhouette width is 0.69 which are much greater than zero. From
this we see that the clustering result is significant and clusters are valid.
We choose Kullback-Leibler divergence (hereafter KLD) to express the
dissimilarity between text vectors, use Formula 2 to calculate the probability
distribution divergence between text vectors and adopt PAM algorithm to
cluster the texts. Figure 8 and Table 2 show the clustering results.
Figure 8 shows that the clustering result using KLD is approximately
consistent with those of using Euclidean distance. It also shows a distinct
relationship of distance among three clusters: News Co-broadcasting and

Daily Conversation are located at two opposite poles and their distance is
the longest of all among the results. Behind the headlines with Wen Tao lies
just in between them and is closer to Daily Conversation. Table 2 shows
the similar clustering results of KLD and Euclidean distance as well. The
average silhouette coefficient of cluster 1, 2 and 3 is 0.94, 0.65 and 0.6
respectively and their average silhouette width is 0.73. The clustering result
of KLD is better than that of Euclidean distance.
We use Ward for hierarchical clustering. Hierarchical clustering results
measured by Euclidean distance and KL Divergence are shown in Figure 9
and Table 3, Figure 10 and Table 4 respectively. Their cophenetic correla-
tion coefficient is 0.94 and 0.9 respectively.

Figure 9 and Table 3 show the hierarchical clustering results measured
by Euclidean distance are consistent with that of PAM by Euclidean dis-
tance. It indicates that clustering results are valid. The clustering result is
quite satisfying by and large despite the fact that three texts from Behind
the headlines with Wen Tao are clustered into Daily Conversation and that
three texts from Daily Conversation are clustered into Behind the headlines
with Wen Tao. Simultaneously the internal difference in cluster is much
smaller than external difference between clusters.
Figure 10 and Table 4 shows that the hierarchical clustering results based
on KLD are consistent with the hierarchical clustering results based on
Euclidean distance.
Partition visualization is adopted to show hierarchical clustering results
so that the relation among the three is clearer and more intuitive, as is
shown in Figure 11.
From the four clustering results above, word length can be seen as a dis-
tinguishing feature of various style texts and as the quantitative stylistic fea-
ture as well. The conversational style lies in between the formal written
style and the informal colloquialism, and is very close to the latter. Essen-
tially speaking, Behind the headlines with Wen Tao and Daily Conversation
belong to conversional style, but owing to that their conversational objects,
places and contents are different, their degrees of formality and the usages
of word length are different while the similarity of the uses of word length
between them is comparatively high.
By quantifying the number of words of certain length we acquire the
word length distribution line chart which is shown in Figure 12.
Figure 12 shows that there is an obvious difference in terms of word
length occurrence among different stylistic texts. The percentage of mono-
syllabic words in Daily Conversation, 64%, is higher than that of 32.2% in
News Co-broadcasting, while it is 57.1% in Behind the headlines with Wen
Tao, lying in between Daily Conversation and News Co-Broadcasting and

double-character words in News Co-broadcasting is much higher than that

The percentage of trisyllabic words in News Co-broadcasting, 5.8%, is
higher than that of 2.3% in Daily Conversation and it is 2.7% in Behind
the headlines with Wen Tao, lying in between them. As do four-character
and five-character words. The more percentage of multi-character words in
News Co-broadcasting accords with its characteristics since it has been
taken as an official document which involves a large number of proper
nouns including personal, place and organization names.
The word length distribution line chart shows that Daily Conversation is
inclined to use monosyllabic words, while News Co-broadcasting tend to
use double-character words. The usage frequency of monosyllabic and dou-
ble-character words in Behind the headlines with Wen Tao lies in between
them. Double-syllable word formation in Chinese is the formalizing means
of style which are from the concrete to the abstract in terms of semantics
and from informal to formal in terms of style.
Based on the above analysis, including text clustering results and word
length distribution, word length can be perceived as a quantitative stylistic
feature. The formal and informal colloquial style are at opposite poles in
terms of word length, while conversational style lies in between them and it
is far away from the formal style and near to the colloquialism, or even
substantially resemble.
3.3 Part of Speech as the Clustering Feature
Part of speech (POS) is the grammatical category of word. The purpose of
POS classification is to portray different usages of different words and
grammatical structures of sentences. Words can be divided into content
words and function words. With lexical and grammatical meaning, the for-
mer can independently act as syntactic components whereas the latter, with
only grammatical meaning, cannot independently act as syntactic compo-
nents. Content words can even be divided into nouns, verbs, adjectives,
attributive words, numerals, adverbs, pronouns, special notional words, ono-
matopoeias and interjections. Function words can be divided into preposi-
tions, conjunctions, auxiliary words, and modal particles (Huang & Liao,
2002). In this paper Chinese POS tag set, adopted from ICTCLAS, has
been revised according to the need of information processing, which makes
detailed classification of some POS, for instance, the distinction between
Chinese names, translation names and Japanese names.
We select PAM and Ward algorithms to cluster the text vectors, which
are characterized by POS, in different styles. The partitional and hierarchi-
cal clustering results are shown in Figures 13 and 14 respectively.

Figure 13 and 14 show that partitional and hierarchical clustering results
are consistent with the pre-specified structure of the data-set. These texts
were clustered into corresponding categories, which are pre-defined intui-
tively, with high accuracy of 100%. In Figure 13, the average silhouette

coefficients of cluster 1, 2, and 3 are 0.79, 0.41 and 0.37 with the average
silhouette width of 0.53. In Figure 14, the cophenetic correlation coefficient
is 0.968. These suggest that the clustering results are significant and the
clusters are valid. Analyses based on clustering results are significant. From
Figure 13, we can see that News Co-broadcasting and Daily Conversation
lie in two poles and Behind the headlines with Wen Tao lies in between
them and is closer to the latter. Behind the headlines with Wen Tao and
Daily Conversation are face-to-face communication with different degrees
of formality, so they are similar.
Figure 14 shows that the within-group variance in News Co-broadcasting
is higher than that of the others, which can be explained by their different
styles. As a written formal style, News Co-broadcasting devotes particular
care to the words leading to plentiful POS and distinct difference between
texts. Saussure pointed out that the synchronic difference of language is the
result of diachronic development. So do the synchronic differences between
different styles come from diachronic development? The early human lan-
guage should be the spoken language for daily communication in which the
used words were nouns followed by verbs, adjectives, etc. The later words
could better express abstract things, such as numerals. Then function words
were produced to express grammatical meaning. Is this development obser-
vable in the procedure of children’s language acquisition? Is the cognition
procedure of the world from concrete to abstract objects? Is the grasp of
concepts from concrete to abstract objects as well? These questions are
worth further researching.
The hierarchical clustering result is consistent with the result of the part-
itional clustering. The partition visualization of hierarchical clustering result,
as is shown in Figure 15, makes this consistency more intuitive, indicating
that the results are not accidental. Thus, POS can be taken as stylistic quan-
titative features to distinguish formal written style, conversational style and
daily colloquialism.
The POS distribution line chart is shown in Figure 16. It shows that there
are distinct differences among the uses of POS, which mainly manifest on
nouns, adverbs, personal pronouns, interrogative pronouns, prepositions,
nominal verbs, modal particles, place names, personal names, etc. The
occurrence frequency of nouns in News Co-broadcasting is 26.8%, 13.1%
in Daily Conversation, 14.6% in Behind the headlines with Wen Tao closing
to Daily Conversation. The frequency of pronouns in News Co-broadcast-
ing is 0.83%, 9.0% in Behind the headlines with Wen Tao, 9.1% in Daily
Conversation. The frequency of prepositions in News Co-broadcasting is

4.2%, 2.5% in Daily Conversation, 3.2% in Behind the headlines with Wen
Tao. The change from Verb-Object to Preposition-Object-Verb is a means of
style formalization, which may cause a high frequency of prepositions in
News Co-Broadcasting (Feng, 2010).

The frequency of occurrence of nominal verbs in News Co-broadcasting
is 6.8% and is much higher than the others, which is 0.7% in Daily Conver-
sation and 1% in Behind the headlines with Wen Tao. The change from
Verb-Object to Object-Verb is also a means of Chinese style formalization
(Feng, 2010) which makes the frequency of nominal verbs higher and
higher from Daily Conversation, Behind the headlines with Wen Tao to
News Co-Broadcasting. The frequency of modal particles in News Co-
broadcasting is 0.7%, 6.6% is for Daily Conversation, 2.1% is for Behind
the headlines with Wen Tao, caused by the different styles to which they
belong. The frequencies of occurrence of new words, place names (includ-
ing translation names of places), the distinguishing words, and person
names (including translation names of foreigners) are the highest in News
Co-broadcasting while they are the lowest in Daily Conversation. Formal
reporting style commonly concerns who, at what time and in what place,
says what or does what for what reason and causes what consequence,
which makes events and people involved in the reporting contents. Time
and place will also affect the journalism of reports. Therefore, high frequen-
cies of names, nouns of time, place, institution and location appear in News
Co-broadcasting (Wang & Chen, 2000, p. 213).
The clustering results demonstrate the significant differences between dif-
ferent stylistic texts in terms of part of speech. And part of speech can be
used as a quantitative stylistic feature of corresponding styles. As conversa-
tional style, Behind the headlines with Wen Tao lies in between News Co-
Broadcasting and Daily Conversation and is closer to the latter which has
been also shown in the POS distribution line chart. This line chart verifies
clustering results and further shows the different features in the uses of part
of speech among three stylistic utterances.
3.4 Sentence-initial Word POS as the Clustering Feature
In this section, we examine the use of sentence-initial word part of speech
in different stylistic texts to find whether there is difference among them.
We establish text vectors characterized by sentence-initial word POS by
counting the occurrence frequency of the sentence-initial word POS in texts,
and then select Euclidean distance to represent the dissimilarity between
text vectors and PAM and Ward to cluster all texts. The partitional cluster-
ing results are shown in Figure 17 and Table 5; the hierarchical clustering
results are shown in Figure 18 and Table 6.
Figure 17 shows that News Co-broadcasting texts are clustered into one
singular cluster, far away from Daily Conversation and Behind the

headlines with Wen Tao. The distance between News Co-broadcasting clus-
ter and Daily Conversation cluster is farther than the distance between
News Co-broadcasting and Behind the headlines with Wen Tao. Even
though there are some overlaps between Daily Conversation and Behind the
headlines with Wen Tao, as is seen from Figure 17, and four texts of Behind
the headlines with Wen Tao are clustered into Daily Conversation as is seen
from Table 5, these four texts actually are closer to Behind the headlines
with Wen Tao, far away from Daily Conversation. The average silhouette
coefficients of cluster 1, 2 and 3 are 0.54, 0.24 and 0.32 respectively, the
average silhouette width is 0.37. The average silhouette coefficient of
Behind the headlines with Wen Tao cluster is small because four texts are
clustered into Daily Conversation.

Figure 18 and Table 6 shows that except two texts of Daily Conversation
clustered into Behind the headlines with Wen Tao, the clustering results are
better. These texts of three styles are clustered into corresponding categories
and the between-group dissimilarity among texts are farther than within-
group dissimilarity, thus these three styles have distinct difference between
them in the use of the sentence-initial word POS which can be taken as the
distinguishing feature of styles. The CPCC of dendrogram in Figure 18 is
0.91, thus the hierarchical clustering is valid.

result and also the relation among these three styles. Although two texts of

result shown in Figure 17, indicating the clustering result is not a coinci-
dence. Figures 17 and 18 show that News Co-broadcasting and Daily Con-
versation are in two opposite poles, Behind the headlines with Wen Tao lies
in between them, and is even closer to the latter in terms of the sentence-
initial word part of speech.
We adopted Kullback-Leibler divergence to present the dissimilarity
between text vectors, and selected PAM and Ward algorithms to cluster
texts of different styles. The clustering results are shown in Figure 20 and
21.
Figures 20 and 21 show that the accuracy of these two clustering results
is 100%; an excellent clustering result. In Figure 20, the average silhouette
coefficients of cluster 1, 2, and 3 are 0.69, 0.29 and 0.59, the average sil-
houette width is 0.52. The CPCC of dendrogram in Figure 21 is 0.91. The
relationship among three styles, which can be seen from the clustering
results, are consistent with that from the clustering results of Euclidean dis-
tance. This relation could be even more distinct in which News Co-broad-
casting and Daily Conversation are at two opposite poles and Behind the
headlines with Wen Tao lies in between them and closer to Daily Conversa-
tion.
The partition visualization of hierarchical clustering result (in Figure 22)
makes the relation between these three styles in hierarchical clustering result
by KLD more distinct.

The mutual authentication of these four clustering results show that the
sentence-initial word part of speech can be taken as a quantitative feature
for distinguishing styles. The formal written style and the daily colloquial
style are at two opposite poles, and the conversational style lies in between
them and closer to the daily colloquialism.
We established the sentence-initial word POS distribution line chart by
counting the occurrence frequencies of the sentence-initial word POS in

each of stylistic texts. This line chart can be seen in Figure 23. Figure 23
shows that there are distinct differences in the usage of sentence-initial
word POS among these different stylistic texts. These differences include
the usages of pronoun, noun, adjective, preposition, interjection, verb like
“是”, place name, person name, verb like “有”, etc. In Daily Conversation,
those words (including pronoun, verb, adjective, interjection, verb like
“是”, verb like “有”, modal particle, and intransitive verb) appear in the
beginning of a sentence at the highest frequencies, but at lowest frequencies
in News Co-broadcasting and at mid frequencies in Behind the headlines
with Wen Tao. The occurrence frequencies of nouns, prepositions and new
words at the beginning of sentence are highest in News Co-broadcasting, but
are lowest in Daily Conversation, and are medium in Behind the headlines
with Wen Tao. The distinction of using the sentence-initial word POS leads
to a better result in the clustering procedures mentioned before. The new
words occurrence frequency in News Co-broadcasting is just 0.69% in the
study before, but its frequency at the beginning of a sentence is 2.15%,
which reflects that the characteristic of used words of news reports or TV
programmes. News reports are occupied with new words representing new
developments or new views of new substances, moreover, news reports
usually take these new elements or concepts as the beginning of reporting
(Van Dijk, 2003).
The clustering results and distributions show that the sentence-initial
word POS can be considered as the quantitative stylistic feature of these
three styles. In terms of the sentence-initial word POS, News Co-broadcast-
ing and Daily Conversation are at two opposite poles and Behind the head-
lines with Wen Tao lies in between them and is closer to the latter.
4. CONCLUSIONS
In terms of text clustering, previous researches mainly concentrate on clus-
tering algorithm itself which deals with how to improve clustering results
and how to select text vector features for improving clustering effect, etc.
(Liu, Wang & Xu, 2005; He, Dai, & Jiao, 2007; Zeng, Xu & Bai, 2008).
On the contrary, this paper focuses on which linguistic elements would be
taken as stylistic features with the research tool of text clustering, and on
studying the relations between different styles with the distances between
the clusters to verify that style is actual a polarized continuum: all dis-
courses are either at two opposite poles or lie in between this two poles.

The purposes of our bringing text clustering into quantitative linguistics lies
in: (1) widening the applied range of text clustering; (2) offering new
thoughts for studying the quantization research of textual genre and work
style; (3) deepening the study of quantitative linguistics to some extent.
Linguistic features, i.e. sentence length, word length, POS, sentence-ini-
tial word POS, are selected and the occurrence frequencies of them are
counted for establishing text vectors. The clustering results obtained by
using various algorithms are discussed. The cross-check analysis by cluster-
ing results verify that the linguistic features can be taken as the quantitative
stylistic feature of different styles and can examine the relations between
different styles based on the distances between different clusters. The inter-
nal criteria for cluster validation, silhouette coefficient and CPCC for part-
itional and hierarchical clustering, is selected to validate the cluster and
verify that the clustering result is significant. Then we count the total occur-
rence frequency of this linguistic feature for generating distribution line
chart to verify the exact distinction of this feature in different styles. The
distinction is clearly pointed out, from the distribution line chart, for prov-
ing that this linguistic feature can be perceived as the stylistic feature of
corresponding utterance.
From the above we see that sentence length, word length, the usage of
POS and the sentence-initial word POS can be taken as the quantitative sty-
listic features of these three styles. The different usages of these linguistic
elements can generate corresponding stylistic utterance.
The partitional clustering results and the hierarchical clustering results
show that the conversational style lies in between the formal written style
and daily colloquialism, and is close to the latter, and even has overlap
between them, which offers datum support to verify that style is a polarized
continuum.
Style must exist in the form of bipolarity. From our analysis the two
poles refers to the formal written style and the daily colloquialism. In terms
of style, all discourses are either at two poles or lie in between them. The
conversational style lies in between the formal one and the daily colloquial-
ism due to the pragmatic scene. The communicative object, scene, and con-
tent govern the used style category. The pragmatic scene in Behind the
headlines with Wen Tao is more relatively complex than the others which
have concise scenes in which the communicative objects are all audiences
before TV or listeners in daily life, and the communicative contexts are
lobby or daily scene. However, the communicative objects in Behind the
headlines with Wen Tao are not only the two people but the TV audiences

in which the former determines the easy or colloquial style, but the latter
determine the formal of serious style, and the speaker may make a balance
between them. On the one hand, the programme host will guide guests to
create their own style in order to present an easy scene. On the other hand,
the host must be serious and try to make a formal communicative scene as
well. This must be well balanced between these two choices. The communi-
cative context in Behind the headlines with Wen Tao are also complicated
due to the closed studio and public. The former scene of studio may use
some daily colloquial style, but the later one may use formal style, which
also needs a good balance between them. All these balances make Behind
the headlines with Wen Tao lie in between two opposite poles. Equilibrium
is the natural role for everyone to follow in nature, social society, physical
world and human beings themselves. It is also applied to language. The
choice of style in communication also follows this rule with sub-conscious-
ness, which is a sub-conscious choice for every normal person with linguis-
tic competence.
5. FURTHER STUDY
With the foundation of the present study, we take other linguistic features,
e.g. pronoun, auxiliary word, n-tuple of POS, and syntactic feature, as
eigenvectors to cluster in order to find more quantitative stylistic features,
which can provide and create a new way for the computational stylistic
research.
On the other hand, under the guidance of the research method used in
this article, we select more language samples of more different styles to
check the idea that two styles must exist and are polarized, other styles
exist between two ends. At the same time, we try to more explicitly prove
that the style is a polarized continuum. In communication, style selection is
in the subconscious, so maybe we can find out the interaction rule between
style and communication.
Style is the result of communication, relevant to the object, scene and
content of communication which belong to the pragmatics. So maybe we
can study the relations between the style and pragmatics, consider whether
there is mapping between them and furthermore what the mapping is, which
are significant for natural language understanding and generating, especially
the latter.
