Abstract - With the advent of internet, we have loads of documents online. Many of these are anonymous 
or claimed by more than one person. Identifying the authors of such documents is beneficial for many 
reasons. The textual content is composed of linguistic domains. Each of these domains is governed by 
rules, yet within these rules and among the components, the grammar offers flexibility to the writers. In 
this paper we compare the various techniques used to identify the corresponding authors of documents. 
Keywords: text processing; authorship attribution; feature extraction; machine learning 
I - INTRODUCTION 
Textual documents can be viewed as an outcome of particular choices made by its authors. This is the 
reason each document carries the specific characteristics of its creator. These can be referred to as fingerprints of 
text. While trying to determine authorship, the following assumptions arise.  
• There is a single author 
• There are choices the author decides 
• The author is consistent in his/her preferred choices 
• These choices are present and could be detected in all end products of that creator 
Author Identification study is useful to identify the most plausible authors and to determine evidences to 
support the conclusion. Authorship analysis problem is categorized as follows,   
• Authorship identification: Attribution determines the likelihood of a piece of writing to be produced by 
a particular author by examining other writings of that author.  
• Authorship characterization: It summarizes the characteristics of an author and generates the author 
profile based on his/her writings like gender, educational, cultural background, and writing style. 
• Similarity detection: It compares multiple pieces of writing and determines whether they were produced 
by a single author without actually identifying the author like plagiarism detection. To extract unique 
writing style from the number of online messages, various features such as lexical, syntactic, 
structural, content-free and content-specific need to be considered. 
Although authorship attribution problem has been studied in the past, but in the last few decades, authorship 
attribution of online messages has become a forthcoming research area as it is a confluence of various research 
areas like Machine Learning, Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing. Initially this problem 
started as the most basic problem of author identification of anonymous texts, now it has expanded for forensic 
analysis, electronic commerce etc. This extended version of author attribution problem has been defined as 
needle-in-a-haystack problem [12]. 
When people write an article on any topic, they use certain words unconsciously. Our objective is to find 
some underlying pattern of the author’s style. The fundamental assumption of authorship attribution is that each 
author habitually uses specific words that make their writings unique. Extraction of features that distinguish one 
author from another includes use of statistical or machine learning techniques on large corpus of text. 
In Section 2 below we review existing techniques used for Authorship Analysis along with their 
classification. Section 3 explains basic procedure for authorship analysis. Section 4 summarizes comparison of 
various techniques since the year 2004 till 2014. Section 5 reviews performance evaluation parameters required 
for Authorship Analysis Techniques. This is followed by section 6 to conclude the paper.

II - STATE OF THE ART TECHNIQUES 
2.1 Brief History 
The advent of non-traditional authorship attribution techniques can be traced back to 1887, when Mendenhall 
first created the idea of counting features such as word length. His work was followed by work from Yule 
(1938) and Morton (1965) with the use of sentence lengths to judge authorship. 
2.2 Applications of Authorship Attribution 
• To analyze anonymous or disputed documents and books such as the ancient articles and poems written 
by various authors. 
• Plagiarism detection - to establish whether claimed authorship is valid. 
• Criminal Investigation – to determine source of unauthorized or unsolicited Emails  
• Forensic investigations - verifying the authorship of spam mails, newsgroups messages, or identifying 
the basis of a piece of intelligence. 
2.3 Key Features 
• When an author writes they use certain words unconsciously. 
• Find some underlying ‘fingerprint’ for an author’s style. 
• The fundamental assumption of authorship attribution is that each author has habits in wording that 
make their writing unique. 
• It is well known that certain writers can be quickly identified by their writing style. 
• Extract features from the given text that differentiate an author from another 
• Applying certain statistical or machine learning techniques on given training data 
• Showing examples and counterexamples of an author's work 
2.4 Issues involved in the process 
Identification of authors needs expertise in linguistics, statistics, text authentication, literature, etc. Hence, 
this is an interdisciplinary area. Too many style measures have to be applied and style markers need to be 
determined. Although statistical methods may be complicated or simple, too many exist in the literature. The 
features are extracted only after parsing all the documents thoroughly. The results have to be combined in order 
to obtain certain characteristics about the authors. Apply each of the statistical or machine learning approaches 
to assign a given document to the most likely author. 
2.5 Current Techniques 
Computerized analysis of documents was developed in 1980’s, from the previous statistical analysis of 
literary style. This is termed “Stylometry”. In order to quantify some of the features of an author’s style, the 
following measures are explored. 
Word or Sentence Length: This is a method developed in the origin of Stylometry. Due to the naïve 
quantification, it is not a reliable method. 
Function Words: This method relies on word usage and context-free words. Using this method, we can 
analyze words’ frequency, position, and immediate context of words. This is a criticized method, and cannot 
reliably distinguish between certain literature types. 
Vocabulary Distributions: In this method, we measure the richness or diversity of an author’s vocabulary. It 
analyzes the frequency profile of word usage to glimpse the author’s extent of vocabulary. 
Content Analysis: This method tabulates the frequency of types of words in a text. It aims to reach the 
denotative or connotative meaning of the text. 
III CLASSIFICATION OF METHODS 
The methods for authorship attribution are broadly classified based on the statistical or machine learning 
approach adopted for the purpose. These are summarized in Figure 1 below. The statistical univariate methods 
include Naïve Bayes Classifier, Cusum Statistics procedure and Cluster Analysis.

Fig. 1.Main Techniques in Authorship Attribution 
The machine learning techniques are Feed-forward neural network, Radial basis function, Support Vector 
Machines, Fisher’s linear discriminant function and Echo state neural network. 
IV TYPICAL PROCEDURE 
The procedure followed in identifying authors typically consists of four stages as shown in Figure 2. The first 
step is data collection. During this phase, we collect materials written by potential authors from various sources 
and store them in digitized form.

Feature extraction is the second stage. After extraction, each unstructured text is represented as a vector of 
writing-style features. The next step is model generation. The dataset is a large collection of textual documents. 
This should be divided into training and testing sets. Classification techniques are applied, while an iterative 
training and testing process is undertaken. Finally, in the fourth stage, author identification is done. The 
developed model is used to predict the authors. 
V COMPARISON OF TECHNIQUES 
This section summarizes the various techniques used for authorship identification reported in research forum 
since 2004 till 2014. History of studies on authorship attribution problems is presented in tabular format year 
wise.  
For each method, we identify the corpus on which the method was tested, the feature types used and the 
categorization method used, along with the size of training set. Table 1 lists the comparative study of all 
authorship techniques.

VI CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK 
To determine prediction accuracy, the number of authors and the size of training data set both play vital role. 
This comparative study concluded that if number of author’s increases and size of training sets decreases then 
performance degrades. So far, there were no studies examining their impact on the authorship-identification 
performance in a systematic way. The problem of authorship attribution is explored well in the area of English 
language, but limited work has been done for the authorship identification in other languages and multilingual. 
Thus, by considering all these further research direction is to do work in various languages other than English 
and also concentrate on authorship identification of a multilingual text having more than one language or a 
single method used to identify more than one language.
