Preface
As the rapid developments of the Internet and mobile Internet, e-mails and in-
stant messages have become most common and convenient media for our daily
communications. However, spam, usually defined as unsolicited commercial or
bulk e-mails, has been considered as an increasingly serious challenge to the
infrastructure of the Internet, and severely intervened people’s normal com-
munications at work and life. According to the statistics from International
Telecommunication Union (ITU), about 70% to 85% of the present emails
in the Internet are spam. Numerous spam not only occupies valuable com-
munications bandwidth and storage space, but also threatens the security of
networking computer systems when it is used as a carrier of viruses and ma-
licious codes. Meanwhile, spam wastes much users time to tackle with them,
therefore decreases the productivity tremendously.
To fight against the spam, many solutions have been put forward to fil-
tering spam off, which could be grouped as three categories: simple approach-
es, intelligent approaches and hybrid approaches. Simple approaches such as
munging, listing, aliasing, and challenging, can be easily implemented while
are also prone to be deceived by tricks of spammers. Intelligent approaches
play an increasingly important role in anti-spam in recent years for their a-
bilities of self-learning and good performance. However, a single anti-spam
shield with one technique alone can be easily intruded in practice. Conse-
quently, hybrid approaches by combining two or more techniques together are
proposed in attempts to improve overall performance whilst overcoming the
shortcomings of each single approach.
Among the varieties of anti-spam techniques, Artificial Immune System
(AIS) inspired from Biological immune system (BIS), shows its excellence in
performance and increasingly becomes one of most important methods to filter
off spam.
The BIS is a dynamically adjusting system which is characterized by the
abilities of learning, memory, recognition and cognition, such that it is good
at recognizing and removing antigens effectively for the purpose of protection
of the organism. Generally, the AIS is an adaptive systems inspired by the-
oretical immunology and observed immune functions, principles and models
for problem solving, and is of a dynamic, adaptive, robust and distributed
learning system. By mimicking BIS’s mechanisms and functions, AIS is devel-
oped and now widely used in time-varying unknown environment for anomaly
detection, fault detection, pattern recognition, optimization, learning, spam
filtering, and so on.

xvi Preface
The AIS features are just what an information security system such as
spam filtering system needs, while the functions of BIS and information secu-
rity system are very similar to some extent. Therefore, the biological immune
principles provide effective solutions to computer security issues. The devel-
opment of AIS-based information security systems, especially AIS-based anti-
spam system, is increasingly receiving extensive attention. The application of
immune principles and mechanisms can protect our computer and Internet
network environment greatly.
Spam filtering is essentially a typical pattern recognition problem. To ad-
dress the problem, many approaches have been proposed to filter spam from
email traffics. In most cases, there are three main stages to achieve success,
i.e. term selection, feature extraction, and classifier design. This book presents
all of the three stages in detail. Specifically, as for term selection, this book
presents a term space partition (TSP) approach, then a novel feature con-
struction approach based on TSP, for a purpose of establishing a mechanism
to make terms play more sufficient and rational roles in email categorization.
As for feature construction, this book emphasizes on AIS-based feature con-
struction methods which are the primary contents of this book and contain
several feature construction approaches based on variety of immune concentra-
tions. As for classifier design, this book shows that the mechanisms of danger
theory are effective in combining classifiers. Finally, online implementation
strategies of an immune based intelligent email server are developed under
Linux operation system environment.
This book primarily consists of 13 chapters. The first two chapters briefly
introduce anti-spam techniques and artificial immune system, respectively.
From chapter 3 to chapter 9, immune inspired feature extraction methods
from a variety of immune principles are elaborated, which include the feature
extraction or construction approaches based on term space partition, global
concentration, local concentration, multi-resolution concentration, adaptive
concentration selection, variable length concentration, as well as parameter
optimization of concentrations. The subsequent two chapters give two kinds
of classifiers based on immune danger theory, i.e, immune danger theory based
ensemble method and immune danger zone principle based dynamic learning
method. The last two chapters describe immune based dynamic updating al-
gorithm, AIS-based spam filtering system and its implementation.
All of the above contents came from our research work and the academic
papers published by myself and my guided PhD and master students during
the past decade. This book gives a panoramic image of spam filtering based
on artificial immune system, which applied immune principles to feature at-
traction, classifier combination, and classifier updating, as well as online im-
plementation for purpose of demonstrating the rationality of AIS methods for
spam filtering.
In addition, the author presents those AIS-based anti-spam techniques in
didactic approach with detailed materials and shows their excellent perfor-

mances by a number of experiments and comparisons with the state of the art
anti-spam techniques.
Furthermore, a collection of references and resources is listed at webpages
at http://www.cil.pku.edu.cn/resources/ and
http://www.cil.pku.edu.cn/publications/.
Nevertheless, there is still a long way to go for us to apply the immune
based anti-spam techniques to the real-world mail filtering systems for a great
advance.
The aim of this book is to provide a single collection of our proposed models
and algorithms of anti-spam based on artificial immune systems during the
past decade, which are scattered in a variety of academic journal papers and
international conference papers, for academia, researchers and practitioners
who are interested in the AIS-based solutions to spam filtering.
This book is intended to the audience who wishes to learn about the s-
tate of the art AIS-based anti-spam techniques. In order to understand the
contents of this book comprehensively, the readers should have some funda-
mentals of computer architecture and software, computer security and spam
filtering, artificial intelligence, computational intelligence, pattern recognition
and machine learning.
Due to the limited specialty knowledge and capability of mine, a few of
errors, typos and inadequacy must have in the book, some critical comments
and valuable suggestions are warmly welcome. All comments and suggestions
can send to ytan(AT)pku.edu.cn.
Finally, I, here, would like to deliver my heartfelt thanks to all who gave
and will give a help in improving the quality of this book in advance.

Huge amount of spam not only wastes resources, but also brings severe threat-
s to computer system security. To cope with these problems, researchers
have conducted extensive researches on anti-spam technologies. This chap-
ter presents the history, current situation and latest advances in researches
on anti-spam technologies in detail. First, this chapter describes and discusses
current anti-spam techniques, including legal means, email protocol method-
s, simple techniques and intelligent approaches. Then, intelligent anti-spam
techniques, which are the most widely used and researched recently, are intro-
duced and analyzed from two aspects, namely feature extraction approaches
and classification methods. After that, performance evaluation methods and
benchmark corpora for spam filtering are given. Finally, this chapter sum-
marizes the current anti-spam techniques, and points out the directions of
anti-spam researches in future.

2 Anti-spam Techniques Based on Artificial Immune System
1.1 Spam Problem
With the development of information technology and the popularity of the
internet, email has been one of the most important communication tools. At
the same time, the sending of numerous spam has made much trouble in e-
mail communication, because these bulk emails not only waste communication
bandwidth and storage, but also cost large resources of capital and time. Con-
sequently, anti-spam is an urgent measure and becomes a hot research issue
in the fields of computer and information security [200].
1.1.1 Definition of Spam
In 1978, email spam first appeared in Arpanet, bringing minor annoyance
to the Arpanet users [32]. Nowadays email has gradually developed into a
major means of peoples’ communication, while the number of spam emails is
increasingly expanded and the impact on people’s daily life becomes more and
more serious. Although the email has the diversity in form and content, but
there is a clear distinction between the junk email and regular email. From
email users’ (recipients’) point of view, the normal daily emails contain useful
communication information, while meaningless information that users are not
interested in constitutes junk emails. Different from the daily communication
use of normal emails, the goals of sending large number of junk emails are
usually business promotion, marketing, advertisement and others. In order to
achieve real effectiveness of propaganda, the sending frequency of the same
email is very high in huge scales.
Researchers usually define spam from the three general characteristics of
above [175]. The classic definition of spam [47] is “unsolicited bulk email
(UBE)”, or “unsolicited commercial email (UCE)” by taking the business pur-
pose of spam into account. Reference [67] defines spam as the emails whose
users are not interested in, and spam can be regarded as the electronic version
of traditional paper junk mail. Reference [7] gives the definition of spam from
the perspectives of both sending behavior and content, and says spam are
emails that are sent and spread in large amount but without permission of re-
cipients. Reference [179] points out that spam has the following three aspects
of characteristics: 1) The email is not associated with a specific user, and the
user’s identity has no relationship with the content of the email; 2) The re-
cipient does not expressly consent to receive the email; 3) The content of the
email does not make any sense for the recipient, and the recipient is also not
interested in the email. Although there are some differences between these
definitions, they all take users’ experience into account during formulating
features of spam. Spam is and will be only a burden to email users.

1.1.2 Scale and Influence of Spam
Compared with the traditional mail, email brings great convenience to our
daily communication, for both reducing the communication cost and enhanc-
ing the communication efficiency. However, the features of low cost and fast
speed of mail also make it convenient for spam senders to spread commercial
advertising, bad information, and even computer viruses. Symantec report
gives the statistics of the number and type of global spam email, and analyzes
the current status of spam email [178]. Spam made up 67.7% of total emails
in December, 2011; This ratio rose to 69% in January, 2012, for the spam
senders’ sending of large amount of commercials during the New Year period.
As can be seen, the number of spam is very large, and spam has occupied
most portion of the email traffic. The contents of spam are mainly related
to pharmaceutical, watch, adult dating, weight loss, etc, where the number of
spam that are related to pharmaceutical advertising is the most and makes up
38% of the overall spam. In addition to advertising, a small amount of spam
involves malicious software, such as email virus and Trojans.
Commtouch Internet Threats Report [44] makes a statistical analysis of
spam in the first quarter of 2012, pointing out that the number of spam has
declined when compared to the same period of last year, but the average daily
sending amount of spam is still up to 94 billion. Among all types of spam,
the ratio of spam associated with pharmaceutical advertising has risen over
that of the same period of last year, accounting for the overall proportion of
38.5%. The report also analyzes the domains of spam’s header information,
and concludes that the spam senders generally forge the header information of
emails and the use of domain “gmail.com” gets the highest proportion when
counterfeiting domain names.
Sophos Security Report [173] points out that spam senders often use virus-
es, worms, Trojan horses and other malicious programs to infect and damage
others’ computer systems and steal their user names and passwords, and even
send spam by controlling those infected computers. Those infected computers
essentially constitute a huge spam sending network, called as botnet by the
researchers. This method is one of the primary means of sending spam emails,
and botnets often contain a lot of junk emails. The botnet Rustock, which
was closed in 2011, could send more that 30 billion spam in a day. When the
botnet Rustock was closed, the global number of spam instantly noticeably
declined. Sophos Security Report also analyzes the regional distribution of
spam. According to the statistics in country, the US, India and Korea are the
top three in sending number of spam. According to the statistics in continent,
Asian has the largest sending number of spam, accounting for 45.04%.
With the growth of sending scale, the impact caused by spam has become
more and more serious [175]. Ferris Research Group [154] points out, spam
not only wastes network resources and affects network performance, what’s
more important, it also wastes a lot of users’ valuable time to review and
delete the spam, resulting in low productivity. They estimate that the waste
4 Anti-spam Techniques Based on Artificial Immune System
of resources caused by spam worldwide in a year is up to $ 130 billion. In
addition, some spam comes with viruses, Trojans, worms and other malicious
software, threatening the network security and user privacy. Symantec report
[178] shows that there is one email containing the malicious software among
every 295 spam and one phishing email among every 370 spam.
1.2 Prevalent Anti-spam Technologies
1.2.1 Legal Means
To deal with the massive losses resulted from spam, some countries have
worked out corresponding acts to regulate the email sending field, attempt-
ing to narrow down the stream of spam. The US has, in 2003, formulated
the Anti-spam Act — Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography
and Marketing Act, CAN-SPAM Act. Actions like forgery of mail header in-
formation, mail address fraudulence and mail address attacks are explicitly
prohibited in this act. At the same time, business emails are required to be
linked with the unsubscribe button or website. This rule in the act, however,
as the document [74,81] points out, has not the clear effect on the spam con-
trolling, but has provided a way for the spam makers to conform the authentic
or say effective mail addresses.
The 107th article of the Telecom Act of Australia has different requests for
individuals and companies [74,143]. For individuals, only under the allowance
of the recipient can spam producers send emails to them (including business
emails, and emails to over 50 people). The requirements are relatively loose
for companies and spam consisting of the unsubscribed links have their access
to the business.
The European Assembly has passed, in June, 2002, the law and regulation
on the privacy and electronic communication [25], which banned the sender
to send spam without the permission of the recipient.
The formulation and implementation of these laws and articles have tack-
led some spam problems to some extent. These laws and regulations alone,
however, can by no means completely eradicate the spam. Therefore, the com-
bination of laws and regulations with other technical approaches are supposed
to be the best way to better filter spam and guarantee the effectiveness of the
email communications.
1.2.2 Email Protocol Methods
Email protocols control the delivery of email between the sender and recipi-
ent, including SMTP protocol (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), POP protocol
(Post Office Protocol) and IMAP protocol (Internet Message Access Proto-
Anti-spam Technologies 5
col). SMTP protocol is used to control the delivery of email between MUA
(Mail User Agent) and MTA (Mail Transfer Agent), and the delivery between
two MTAs [111,146]. POP protocol controls how to receive emails from MTA
and put them into the local MUA [137]. According to the IMAP protocol,
users can directly access remote MTA and read emails on the email server,
instead of downloading emails to a local MUA [48].
Among these protocols, SMTP protocol is mainly used to control the send-
ing and delivery of emails. Under this protocol, users can easily and con-
veniently interact with others by email communication. However, since the
control strategy of this protocol is very simple, it brings an opportunity for
spam senders. To effectively control sending of spam, there are two aspects
of the SMTP protocol need to be improved [127]: On the one hand, during
the delivery of emails, the unread emails are stored on the recipients’ MTA,
resulting in that the recipients would pay the price of the storage. Due to this
strategy, the cost of sending spam is very low, which is one of the main reason
of the massive flooding of junk emails. On the other hand, the SMTP proto-
col does not provide a valid sender authentication mechanism. According to
the SMTP protocol, the email header information is basic text information
and can be filled in by email senders at will, while the protocol does not pro-
vide verification mechanism. This makes it possible for spam senders to easily
forge the email header information and successfully evade the filtering of those
techniques based on header information.
To transfer the cost of sending spam to the email senders, reference [20]
proposes a method to improve the way of email delivery: during the delivery
process, emails are always stored on the senders’ MTA until the recipients
successfully finish receiving the emails. Reference [68] proposes a protocol in
which the recipients could control the sending process of emails. When sent
from strangers, the emails are first stored on the senders’ MTA and the email
summaries (or envelopes) are delivered to the recipients, and only when the
recipients are interested in the emails, the emails are sent successfully. Ref-
erence [102] proposes a protocol where the email addresses are encapsulated.
Under this protocol, when users publish their email addresses on the internet,
information for restricting the use of the email addresses are encapsulated into
the email addresses at the same time. When sent to these addresses, emails
are verified according to the limit information encapsulated in the email ad-
dresses, and sent successfully only if they meet the limitation. This strategy
could avoid the malicious use of email addresses. These methods for proto-
col improvement could theoretically achieve good effect as they control the
mails from the source. However, it is too complicated to implement the im-
proved protocols since it needs to upgrade the existing mail delivery facilities
completely.
6 Anti-spam Techniques Based on Artificial Immune System
1.2.3 Simple Techniques
In the early days of the process of anti-spam studies, people have made out
some simple countermeasures through observation of the basic features of s-
pam and the cardinal methods of sending them. These simple ways in handling
the spam have taken great effect.
1) Address Protection
Reference [94] mentioned a comparatively easier way in dealing with s-
pam, which is to keep away the spam by changing the open email addresses.
For example, converting the email address “usernamedomain.com” into “user-
name#domain.com” or “username AT domain.com”. And sometimes chang-
ing the “.” into “DOT” can also work. By doing so, we can prevent the spam
senders from getting the email addresses on websites through creeper skills.
Nevertheless, the protective ability of this technology is too weak. The spam
senders can still extract the real email addresses by simply adding some sim-
ple identification code when collecting email addresses. By now, through the
dictionary attacks, the email address collection program can examine the ID
number of the mail servers, as well as extract email addresses of the non-page
documents (like DOCJPEGPDFXLSRTFPPT ) on the internet.
2) Key-words Filtering
Key-words Filtering technology [45] is a way of judging the types of emails
by testing whether or not there exists the words among the predefined ones,
such as “invoice”, “sales promotion”, “Viagra”, ect. At first, we use a complete
match method. For example, “Viagra” can only match with “Viagra”, and
not applicable for “Viiaagra”. But this method can be easily avoided for spam
makers by making some small changes in the words. Later on, a so-called
regular expression method is gradually accepted by many approaches. The
particular mode of “V*i*a*g*r*a” can be matched with “V-i-agra”, “Viiaagra”
and “Viagra”. This mode match method can effectively decrease the sphere
of the key words and can be applied to the small changes of spam in some
degree.
3) Black-list and White-list
Both of the two methods are based on the simple recognition the senders’
identity. When information about identity is found to be forged, these two
methods will lose their effect [160]. Black-list method is a way of filtering the
spam by rejecting emails from specific IP addresses, TCP links, or domain
names. But sometimes some information contained in the head of the email
may be fabricated by the spam makers into other addresses. Thus the result
is some innocent people’s emails may be filtered altogether [93]. White-list
method refers to a way of rejecting all the email resources, only allowing
emails from the specific IP addresses, TCP links or Domain names. This is
not a very convenient method to be used as it requires the two parties to send
emails to each other for identity conformation.
4) Grey-list and Challenge-Response
Grey-list method will respond to those emails which are not within the
Anti-spam Technologies 7
list of the server as the email is temporarily failing to be sent [225]. For those
normal emails, the MTA will resend the email when it senses the response,
that is, the server will resend it successfully on the reception of the email. But
for spam, emails tend to be sent through open-relay, unable to be resent for
wrongly responses, as a result of which the email cannot be reached by the
recipients. The disadvantage of this method is that there will be some delay
in sending normal emails.
Challenge-Response has added the challenge-response strategy on the basis
of the white-list [209]. Likewise, this method has a white list. Email addresses
from the white list will be successfully received. But when the addresses are
the ones out of the list, the server will send to the sender a “Turing test”.
The email will arrive at the receiver on the condition that the sender has
passed the test, and the corresponding sender’s email address will be added
to the original white list. Spam makers will usually adopt the forged senders’
addresses to avoid the backwards traces, and are not expected to receive any
returned tests.
On one hand, these two methods are responses made on the premise of
the normal emails and spam, which takes advantage of the fact that spam
cannot make response accordingly to judge the types of the emails. On the
other hand, the process of making responses means to be delayed and occupy
the bandwidth of the internet.
1.2.4 Intelligent Spam Detection Approaches
Intelligent spam detection approaches are the most effective and widely used
technologies in the field. On one hand, intelligent detection approaches are
highly automated and do not need much human intervention. But, on the
other hand, intelligent detection approaches are characterized of high accura-
cy, robustness, strong noise tolerance and can adapt to the dynamic changes
of the emails’ content and users’ interests.
In view of the intelligent approaches, spam detection is a typical classifica-
tion problem, which could be solved by the supervised machine learning meth-
ods. Commonly, supervised machine learning methods extract discriminative
information as features from the training sets and construct classifiers based
on the features extracted according to the corresponding learning principles
to classify newly coming email samples. Except for some human involvement
during the process of training set generation, the learning and classification
processes are completed automatically. Meanwhile, the learning model can
adapt to the dynamic changes of emails’ content and users’ interests through
adjusting the training sets and updating the classifiers [99,198]. A lot of clas-
sical machine learning methods have been successfully applied in spam detec-
tion [32, 45, 114], including Naive Bayes (NB) [40, 157, 169], Support Vector
Machine (SVM) [22, 67, 109, 197], k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN) [12, 83, 85, 158],
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) [41, 199, 229] and Boosting [33, 91]. These
methods have completed theoretical analysis and can achieve high perfor-
8 Anti-spam Techniques Based on Artificial Immune System
mance in spam detection, which endows them with good prospects of develop-
ment. The following sections will concentrate on the intelligent spam detection
approaches from two aspects, namely feature extraction and classification.
1.3 Email Feature Extraction Approaches
The feature extraction of an email is an essential part in a spam detection sys-
tem. The accuracy, distinctiveness, robustness and adaptability of the feature
extraction approach can affect the overall classification results and perfor-
mance directly. According to the report by Chinese Internet Association in
the fourth quarter of 2008 [174], the format of spam are mainly divided into
three categories: text + image, text only and image only. This section reviews
the classical feature extraction approaches based on text, image and behavior,
respectively.
Before introducting the feature extraction approaches, let’s talk about the
term selection strategies (feature selection strategies) at first, which are indis-
pensable and widely used in the process of feature extraction. Term selection
strategies are used to evaluate the importance of a term or feature, or the
quantity of information that a term or feature has, for the classification task
to reduce the computational complexity and the possible effects from the noisy
terms or features.
1.3.1 Term Selection Strategies
1) Information Gain (IG)
In information theory, the entropy is also known as Kullback-Leibler dis-
tance [232]. It can measure the distance of the sum of two probability distribu-
tions. In the studies on spam detection, it is used to measure the goodness of
terms or features (discrimination). According to this strategy, when knowing
whether a given term appears in an email, we can calculate the amount of
information about the types of the receiving emails .
I(ti) =
∑
C∈{cs,cl}
{ ∑
T∈{ti,t̄i}
P (T,C) log
P (T,C)
P (T )P (C)
}
(1.1)
where C represents the mail type, cs and cl indicate that the mail types of
spam and legitimate email, respectively. ti means the term appears in the
email, while t̄i shows the term ti is not in the email.
According to this formula, the information entropy of each term will be
calculated and the larger one will be selected to enter the next stage.
2) Term Frequency Variance (TFV)
Koprinska et al. [113] develops the term frequency variance (TFV) method
Anti-spam Technologies 9
to select the terms with large term frequency variance. They think that terms
with large term frequency variance contain more information. According to
this strategy, these terms tending to appear in the same email type (spam or
normal email) will be chosen while those with equivalent term frequency in
the two types will be removed. In research of spam detection, term frequency
variance is defined as follows.
T (ti) =
∑
C∈{cs,cl}
[Tf (ti, C)− Tµf (ti)]
2 (1.2)
where Tf (ti, C) is the occurrence frequency of term ti, T
µ
f (ti) is the average
occurrence frequency of term ti in both types of emails.
Reference [113] shows that the performance of TFV is better than IG in
most cases. The top 100 terms of TFV and IG display that these terms have
two characteristics: 1) frequently appearing in linguistics related emails; 2)
appearing frequently in spam but rarely appearing in legitimate emails.
3) Document Frequency (DF)
Document Frequency is the total number of a specific term ti over the
whole training set [233]. According to this strategy, the term whose DF is
larger than a threshold will be chosen. The definition of DF of term ti is as
fellows.
D(ti) = |{mj |mj ∈ M,and ti ∈ mj}| (1.3)
where M represents the whole training sets and mj represents a single email
in M .
DF indicates that the low-frequency terms have little information, so it
will make no difference when these terms are removed. Ref [233] shows that
when 90% of the low-frequency terms are removed, the performance of DF
and IG is similar. The advantages of DF are its low computational complexity
and linear proportional increase.
4) Other Term Selection Strategies
Term selection strategy plays an important role in the spam detection sys-
tem [77,133,134]. In order to further understand term selection, three functions
are listed below [25,88,233].
CHI: χ2(ti, c) =
|M |(P (ti,c)P (t̄i,c̄)−P (t̄i,c)P (ti,c̄))2
P (ti)P (t̄i)P (c)P (c̄)
Odds Ratio: τ(ti, c) =
P (ti|c)
1−P (ti|c)
1−P (ti|c̄)
P (ti|c̄)
Term Strength: S(ti) = P (ti ∈ y|ti ∈ x)
In the above formulas, C ∈ {cs, cl} are the types of emails and x and y
represent two different kinds of emails in the training set, respectively.
1.3.2 Text Based Feature Extraction Approaches
The email feature extraction based on text usually contains two steps: 1) Term
selection. According to the importance of terms, distinctive terms are chosen
10 Anti-spam Techniques Based on Artificial Immune System
to enter the next stage, as has been introduced above. 2) Feature extraction
and display. The features of emails are extracted and displayed, which are
expressed in a unified form.
1) Bag-of-Words (BoW)
This approach is also called vector space model, which is one of the most
widely used feature extraction approaches in spam detection [9,10,82,88,103].
It converts each email into a n-dimension feature vector < x1, x2, ..., xn >
through observing whether the term occurs in the email. In this approach, the
value xi of each Xi is the function of term ti. And there are usually two types
of representation for xi: boolean type and frequency type [13]. In the boolean
type, xi is assigned as this mode: if ti occurs in the email, then xi is 1 and
otherwise, xi is 0. In the frequency type, xi is the frequency of term ti. In
the experiments by Schneider, performance of the two representation types is
similar [165].
2) Sparse Binary Polynomial Hashing (SBPH)
This method uses a sliding window to extract different features from emails
[171, 235]. The N-term-length sliding window slides the email and each step
it moves a term. In each sliding of the window, we extract 2N-1 features:
the fresh terms into the window is reserved and other terms are reserved or
deleted. And there are 2N-1 choices for the N-1 terms in the window, so we
can obtain 2N-1 features. Then each feature is converted into a specific Hash
value. After the extraction of features, the method will choose terms by the
previous terms selection methods, which has a high precision but also a high
computational complexity.
3) Orthogonal Sparse Bigrams (OSB)
In order to reduce the redundancy and complexity of SBPH, Siefkes [171]
proposed orthogonal sparse bigrams (OSB) to extract a smaller feature set,
which uses a N-term-length sliding window. What is different from SPBH is
that only the common terms are extracted by OSB. For each window, the fresh
term will be reserved for the common term and choose another N-1 terms to
match it. As a result, each window can construct N-1 pairs of terms to reflect
N-1 features. Compared with PSBH, it can reduce the number of features.
Reference [171] shows that the performance of OSB is better than SBPH.
4) Artificial Immune System (AIS)
Oda et al. [140] designed an anti-spam immune system, which take advan-
tage of regular expression to construct antibody (detector). The application
of regular expression makes every antibody match massive antigen (spam),
which can reduce the features effectively. Biological immune system (BIS)
gives weights to each antibody. In the beginning of the algorithm, the entire
antibody is initialized as default values. After a period of running, the weights
of antibody matching more spam will increase and those matching legitimate
emails will reduce. When the weights of antibody are less than the preset
threshold, the antibody will be removed from the model.
More advances in research of AIS based spam filtering will be introduced
in the next chapter.
Anti-spam Technologies 11
1.3.3 Image Based Feature Extraction Approaches
Besides text content, emails sometimes contain image information. In normal
emails, attached images are generally daily life photos about portraits, land-
scapes, architectures and others for daily communication in life and work;
While in spam, images always contain advertising text information for the
purpose of advertising and marketing [25, 75]. There are apparent differences
between the spam images and normal images on the aspects of image at-
tributes, colors, text, background, etc, and a number of image based feature
extraction approaches have been proposed according to the significant differ-
ences between these two categories of images [16,24].
1) Property Features of Image
Since spam is sent in huge quantities, spam senders usually control the
size of the spam image by taking the network bandwidth and transmission ef-
ficiency into account. This makes the attributes of a spam image significantly
different from that of a normal image. Reference [65] extracts the attribute
information of images as feature vectors, including storage size, image length,
image width, image compression formats and other information. Similar to
the above work, Uemura et al. uses the image name, storage size as features
and meanwhile adds the image compression rate information [208]. They point
out that the spam image generally has a higher compression ratio than that
of a normal image because the content of a spam image is relatively simple.
Ref [115] employs similar attribute information as image features and ana-
lyzes the quantity of information that each attribute feature has by defining
and calculating the noise ratio, which is associated with the email category
information, of each attribute feature.
Reference [230] points out that the aspect ratio of a spam image is quite
different from that of a normal image. There exist a large number of banner
among the spam images and the difference between the length and width
of a banner image is obvious. They take the number of banner images as a
individual feature to construct the feature vector together with other features.
He et al. compare images from the attributes like storage size, height, width,
aspect ratio, etc, which are taken as preliminary features [92]. When it is
difficult to determine the type of the email based on the above preliminary
features, the color and histogram information are further extracted.
2) Color and Texture Features of Image
Byun et al. have noted that normal images have significantly different color
features from spam images [31]. There are discriminations between the spam
images and normal images in the aspects of color distribution, color intensity,
etc, according to the histograms. The regional similarity of a spam image is
high, while the spam images have color heterogeneity. The color saturation of
spam images differs from that of the normal images [84]. This method divides
the images into multiple categories by extracting these color features, where
five types of spam images are included, like synthetic image, complex back-
ground image, etc, as well as three types of normal images, namely photograph,
12 Anti-spam Techniques Based on Artificial Immune System
map and comic. [131] pointed out that the smoothness of color distribution of
spam images is not as good as normal images, because the spam images are
generally synthetic and contain clear and sharp objects.
Wang et al.construct feature vectors by extracting the color histogram, di-
rection histogram and coefficients of Haar wavelet transform and detect spam
images with similarity comparison [223]. Since the number of spam emails
sent is very large, spam images sent in the same batch generally have great
similarities. In the training phase, similarity distances between the spam im-
ages and normal images are calculated and the minimum similarity distance
is made threshold value. In the classification phase, similarities between the
feature vectors of newly coming images and the vectors in the feature library
are calculated, and categories of new images are achieved by weighted voting.
Wu et al. [230] extract the vertical, horizontal and diagonal texture features of
images by using wavelet transform. [76] points out that spam images mostly
contain advertising information and are generally artificially generated, which
result in that the spam images have different color and texture features from
normal images. They extract features through global color histogram and gra-
dient direction histogram, and classify the emails by using boosting methods.
Ref [215] incorporates the property information with color and texture in-
formation together to form the features of each image. The property informa-
tion used in this method includes: image length and width, aspect ratio, image
size, compression ratio and format information; the number of colors, primary
colors, color saturation, etc, are used as color features; texture features are
calculated by using the histogram method. Support vector machine (SVM) is
utilized for classification after the feature extraction [195, 196]. Experimental
results show that the hybrid types of features have better distinguishability
than a single type of features. Huamin et al. [98] achieve higher accuracy by
combining the text features, image property features and histogram features
and integrating the multiple classifiers that are built. Li et al. [119] points
out that global features and local features can reflect different sides of the im-
age. They use the scale invariant feature extraction algorithm to extract the
local features, then combine the local information with the global color and
texture features and execute weighted classification according to the posterior
probability.
3) Character Edge Features
On the basis of extracting edge of character vertically, Aradhye et al. [15]
divide the image into text area and non-text area by calculating the similarity
of character edge in each region and merging the similar regions. After the
division, features of each image are constructed by calculating the size of text
area in each image as well as the corresponding color saturation and color
unevenness in text and non-text areas, respectively. Finally, the feature vector
of an email is achieved by calculating the weighted sum of related features of
all images included in the email according to the acreage of each image and
support vector machine (SVM) [196] is employed for classification.
Wu et al. [230] give an effective method for detecting the text area. Firstly,
Anti-spam Technologies 13
three feature pattern sets are established, namely local edge pattern, local edge
concentration and global edge concentration. Boosting algorithm is used for
generating detectors by training on the feature pattern sets to detect the text
areas in images. Wan et al. [214] extract edge features by using color based
edge detection method and corner information of character edge is also ex-
tracted in their work. Edges of characters and other objects are distinguished
according to the corner information and width and height of the edges. Liu et
al. [123] detect spam images through combing the text area features, which
are edge information and corner information, and the color features.
4) OCR Based Features
Fumera et al. [72] extract the text information in images by using Optical
Character Recognition (OCR) and the text information is further processed
by adopting the text based approaches. Considering the high computational
complexity of the OCR technology, they also point out this method should be
combined with others and only applied to the emails that are hard to classify.
However, they do not consider the influence of noise in spam images on the
OCR technology as there hardly exists noise in spam images at that time.
Biggio et al. [23] point out that the OCR based feature extraction appraoch
could achieve good performance only when noise does not exist in the spam
images.
To fight against the OCR-based detection method, spammers add noise
information into the spam images, such as mixed fonts, background blur,
text distortions and so on. However, these noise information has become the
features distinguishing spam images from normal images. Biggio et al. [23]
analyze the main principle of fuzzy techniques for spam images as well as
the major impact of these techniques on fuzzy OCR process, and further
extract the noise features by detecting abnormal in OCR processing steps.
They propose a method to detect the noise in which the image is converted
into a binary image and the vision complexity is calculated. Since the vision
complexity of the normal image is located in a different range of values from
that of the spam image with noise, we can extract noise features of character
pieces and the background by utilizing this metric.
1.3.4 Behavior Based Feature Extraction Approaches
There are significant difference between spam and normal emails not only on
the content, but also on the sending purpose, transmission method, interac-
tion range, etc. In addition, spammers usually take certain measures to protect
themselves to evade the spam filters. Thus, we can distinguish spam and nor-
mal emails by extracting different behavior features in the sending process of
emails.
1) Behavior Features of Spammers
In the sending process, spammers forge the header information of emails
to hide their identity. This makes the header information of spam has signif-
icant difference from that of normal emails, and the corresponding behavior
14 Anti-spam Techniques Based on Artificial Immune System
features of forgery could be extracted by analyzing the header information of
emails [207, 234]. Yeh et al. [234] extract 17 behavior feature for spam detec-
tion by analyzing the abnormality of single entries and the effectiveness and
consistency of cross entries, and obtain the 113-dimensional feature vector
by sparse coding. Abnormality of single entry is discriminated by checking
whether “From”, “To”, “Delivered-To”, “Return-Path”, “Date” and other in-
formation is abnormal, such as format correctness, whether it is empty, the
time rationality and so on. Features of cross entries are obtained by checking
the effectiveness and consistency of corresponding entries on type and format.
Wu [229] adds the comparison of header information and system log on the ba-
sis of the above, and tells whether there is forgery by checking the consistency
of the corresponding entry. Good performance is achieved by extracting the
26-dimensional behavior feature vectors and applying a hybrid model of rule
processing and back-propagation neural network for classification, which fur-
ther confirms the validity of such behavior features. In [6], information of the
sending process is taken as behavior features, including the number of servers
involved in mail delivery, mail transmission time, and sending the existence
of domain names and others. Experiments show that adding these sending
process information can effectively enhance the performance of the original
behavior feature extraction methods.
Since the sending purposes of spam are similar and the sending behav-
iors have some similarities, some studies can filter spam by group from the
perspective of similarity. Reference [118] studies the similarity of spam send-
ing behaviors (eg, containing the same URL link), and filters spam by group
according to the similarity. Through analyzing the characteristics of emails,
it is found that there is a higher possibility for the spammers who appear in
more than one group to send spam again. Ramachandran et al. [152] study the
similarity of email sending mode. They define sending modes according to the
sending frequency of an IP address to d different domains in the period t and
adopt a clustering analysis on behaviors according to the sending modes. [8]
analyzes the URL links in emails and clusters emails by tracking the located
servers of the linked websites. They point out that one server usually pro-
vide service to numbers of linked websites of spam, allowing clustering emails
according to the server information.
2) Network Behavior Features of Spam
Network features of spam and normal emails are quite different [153], and
researches have extracted the related behavior features from the perspective
of IP address, i.e., sending server, sending time, persistence and etc. [231]
analyzes the login information of mailbox and changes in the login IP and
concludes that most of the emails sent from dynamic IP addresses are spam,
while nearly half of the Hotmail spam are sent from dynamic IP addresses, so
it should be paid extensive attention to the dynamic characteristics when to
extract the IP address related features. West et al. [227] find through analysis
that there is a spatial similarity between spam addresses and they are always
located in adjacent spaces though the spam sending addresses dynamically
Anti-spam Technologies 15
changed. In addition, they found that the historical data in blacklist have a
good reference value in the forecast. They propose a space-time evaluation
method by combining spatial characteristics and historical data, whose error
rate is half lower than that of traditional IP blacklist filtering .
Ramachandran and Feamster [151] study the characteristics of network
behavior during the sending process of spam, and they specifically analyze
the distribution of IP addresses that sending spam, situation of BGP (Border
Gateway Protocol) routing hijack, persistency of spam sending hosts and char-
acteristics of spam botnets. Through analysis, they obtain that the majority
of spam comes from a small range of IP addresses (eg, 60. * - 70. *) and the
spam sending process of botnet is not persistent. They point out that these
network related features should be concerned about during spam filtering, and
pay attention to identify botnets. [112] analyze the spam datasets from 2005
to 2009, and find that the distribution of IP addresses of botnets becomes
more widespread in 2009 compared with that in 2006. This change will lead
to a decline on the performance of IP address based filtering methods and
makes it more difficult to control the botnets.
In [153], the network behavior features of spam are comprehensive ana-
lyzed, which includes the range of IP addresses, type of operating systems,
geographical characteristics, sending modes, etc. Three unsupervised method-
s are utilized to analyze the association characteristics of the spam sending
process. Duan et al. [69] systematically analyze the behavior characteristics
of spammers from the perspective of the mail server and the network layer,
such as the distribution of mail servers, the proportion of spam, the active
time of spammers and so on. They point out that new methods on sender au-
thentication mechanism and email sending control should be studied in order
to effectively reduce spam.
3) Social Network Based Behavior Features
The sending and receiving networks of normal emails and spam are sig-
nificantly different. Normal emails are generally used for interaction between
friends, colleagues and relatives, forming normal social network features, while
the spammer always needs to extract a large number of email addresses from
web pages to send spam, forming abnormal interaction networks [27]. In [27],
each email account is taken as a node and the edges between nodes are con-
structed in accordance with the sending and reception of emails. For the send-
ing network of spam, the number of nodes in the network is large while the
relation between adjacent nodes is relatively simple. The clustering coefficient
calculation methods are given to distinguish normal email sending networks
and spam sending networks according to interconnection of nodes and situa-
tion of shared nodes between adjacent nodes.
Based on [27], Lam et al. [116] construct social networks by extracting
information from the interaction logs of emails determine whether an email
address is used to send spam according to the characteristics of the social
networks. This method extracts an 7-dimensional vector to express the social
network characteristics of each email account, including the number of email
16 Anti-spam Techniques Based on Artificial Immune System
accounts that have sending-reception relations with this email account, the
interaction frequency of this email account with others, etc. For a spammer
account, the number of emails sent by this account will be very large while the
number of emails received is very small, which makes it significantly different
from the interaction process of normal emails. Debarr et al. [63] take the space
distance into consideration when constructing the social network features,
which is defined as the number of transit between two email accounts during
the sending process of email.
Li et al. [121] consider not only the connection relationship between email
accounts but also the metrics of intimacy of social relations and user interest
in the process of constructing social networks. This algorithm requires user
involvement and encourages users to provide their social information, such
as hobbies, occupation, religion, family relationships and so on. Social rela-
tionship and closeness between email accounts are measured through these
information. For email interactions between distant nodes, the algorithm per-
forms more stringent checks. At the same time, this algorithm extracts user
preference from user information and provides personalized spam filtering poli-
cies based on user preferences. In addition, the link weights between nodes are
dynamically adjusted to avoid hijacking attacks of email accounts.
4) Immune Based Behavior Feature Extraction Approaches
Yue et al. [236] extract character information from IP addresses, SMTP
marks, URL links and reply addresses, and computes the corresponding “spam
score” of each part according to the character information and the designed
feature calculation formula. These spam scores are combined to generate anti-
bodies. On basis of this, the initial set of antibodies are adjusted by using the
artificial immune network theory, and antibodies with high affinity are cloned
and mutated by adopting the clonal selection algorithm, where the number of
antibodies with low affinity are suppressed. Eventually, the antibodies of the
immune network are clustered. The use of artificial immune network makes the
behavior features with high affinity be preserved, while the behavior features
with low affinity be filtered out.
1.4 Email Classification Techniques
1) Naive Bayes
Simple and effective, this method is the most common method due to its
simplicity and effectiveness. Many studies have shown that this method is the
most effective way of dealing with the spam, with relatively high precision
rate and recall rate [11,157]. Some studies indicate that the application of the
polynomial mode will acquire higher accuracy rate than that of the Bernoulli
rate [165]. Variations have been derived from the traditional Naive Bayes. Raju
Shrestha [170] has taken the advantage of the internal connection features of
Anti-spam Technologies 17
the same key-words appearing in different places to calculate the co-weighting
of the key-word and made great improvement in its property. Li [120] mentions
the improved Naive Bayes more focused on the users’ feedbacks which has
acquired a comparatively low false positive and better performance.
2) k-Nearest Neighbors
Sakkis [158] has put into effect the k-Nearest Neighbors — kNN (a classical
lazy learning method) in the scope of spam detection. They have studied the
influence of domain (k), the characteristic dimension, and the practice set on
the performance of the testing machine. The experiments has shown that the
average performance and properties are better than Naive Bayes.
3) Boosting Trees
Schapire and Singer [163] are, for the first time, to apply this method
in the area of text classification, which handles the problems of divisions of
multi-class and multi-label through multi base hypotheses. Carreras and Mar-
quez [33] have applied AdaBoost algorithm in email filtering. Based on two
public data sets experiments (PU1 corpus and Ling-Spam corpus), they drew a
conclusion that Boosting Trees method was better than Naive Bayes theorem,
Decision Trees and kNN algorithms in performance. However, Nicholas [181]
thought Boosting Trees and AdaBoost using decision stumps were worse than
Naive Bayes in terms of accuracy and speed.
4) Support Vector Machine
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is deeply discussed in [66,210,211]. Druck-
er, et al. [67] have implemented a spam filter based on SVM. Their research
shows that SVM filter and Boosting Trees can both meet the lowest error
rates, while Boosting Trees spend more time in training process.
5) Ripper
Different from other classification methods, Ripper [43] concludes the rule
of classification from training sample set without the help of feature vectors,
which consists of the rules of if-then.
6) Rocchio
Classifier of this type [164, 180] uses the standardized TF-IDF as vectors
of training samples. The advantage of the classifier lies in its fastness in train-
ing and testing, while the disadvantages can be seen from the following two
aspects: extra training time is needed when searching for optimum threshold
and β in training set, and also these parameters take on a weaker property of
generalization.
7) Clustering
Minoru Sasaki et al. [162] present text clustering based on the feature space
model, using spherical k-means to calculate different clusters and then tagging
the extracted centroid vector according to its class by counting the distance
between the vectors of the new emails and centroid vector. This method has
shown a good detection performance on Ling-Spam corpus.
8) Meta-Heuristics
Chi-Yuan Yeh et al. [234], on account of the influence the variation of key-
words has on the performance of the learning methods of key-words-based
18 Anti-spam Techniques Based on Artificial Immune System
robots, present the use of the behavior of spammers to classify emails. These
behavioral characters are described through Meta-Heuristics. Under the given
Meta-Heuristics, 113 new features have been extracted. The result shows that
this method is superior to the filter type of key-words, and has also shortened
the training time.
9) Artificial Neural Network
James Clark et al. [41], by using Artificial Neural Network (ANN), have
made email classification automatic [155, 156, 186, 190, 193]. Linger, a system
developed by them, has achieved a higher rate of accuracy, recall and preci-
sion. However, experiment on PU1 corpus has shown a performance reduction.
Based on the descriptive properties of words and news, Iran Stuart et al. try
to classify emails with the help of artificial neural network. The experimental
results show that certain extension or modification of the feature set should
be made for its improvement on performance.
10) Artificial Immune System
Andrew Secker [168] put forward the concept of AISEC (Artificial Immune
System for Email Classification), aiming to distinguish emails the users are
interested in and those they are not. Given that there is no repeating in
training, this method can realize advanced email locator on ends, and track
the change of the users’ interests.
Terri Oda et al. [142] have applied this model in spam filtering, taking ad-
vantage of the detection principle of ‘self/non-self’ and the concept of detector.
In the spam filtering system, a gene library is constructed from various sources,
including the lexical vocabularies, words and expressions in the emails collect-
ed, contact information in spam, the header information of emails and so on.
In the process of system initialization, antibody and its related lymphocyte
are produced in a random way. In the process of construction, no similar anti-
bodies are allowed to be produced repeatedly. Each lymphocyte, apart from its
attribute of immunity, has another two attributes, namely, message-matched
and spam-matched, signifying, respectively, the amount of emails matched to
lymphocyte and that of spam. In the training process of lymphocyte, modi-
fications on the property values of message-matched and spam-matched are
made to the matched lymphocytes. In the process of system operation, the
evaluation method of using the weighted average is adopted to sort emails. In
this way, lymphocytes that have been matched for many times takes a larger
proportion in the score.
More advances in research of AIS based spam filtering can be seen in the
next chapter.

1.5 Performance Evaluation and Standard Corpora
1.5.1 Performance Measurements
Spam detection is still a hot topic in the information security, many novel
anti-spam techniques are increasingly proposed and studied deeply. In order
to make it easier to compare and choose a good way to filter spam, researchers
gave a few measurements to make a comparison of the performance between
different ways and systems for filtering spam. This section mainly introduces
and analyzes some common ways to evaluate the performance of spam detec-
tion and give some public standard corpora.
1) Spam recall
Spam recall can figure out the rate of spam correctly spotted and catego-
rized by the arithmetic model. The systematic model with high rate of spam
recall can filter spam and reduce the bad influence made on people’s life by
them more effectively. The following formula is to calculate spam recall.
Rs =
ns→s
ns→s + ns→l
(1.4)
where, ns→s means the number of spam correctly spotted and categorized
while ns→l means the number of spam mistaken as normal mails.
2) Spam precision
Spam precision can figure out the precision of measuring spam. It can figure
out the rate of spam correctly spotted and categorized. It can also reflect the
rate of normal emails mistaken as spam. The higher the spam precision is, the
less the number of normal emails mistaken as spam is. The following formula
is for calculating the spam precision.
Ps =
ns→s
ns→s + nl→s
(1.5)
where, nl→s means the number of normal emails that are mistaken as spam.
3) Legitimate recall and Legitimate precision
Since the spam detection involves two sorts of emails (legitimate emails
and spam), these two measurements are corresponding to the spam recall and
spam precision. The formulas can be deduced accordingly.
4) Accuracy
Accuracy can reflect the whole performance of a spam filtering system.
It can measure out the rate of emails categorized correctly by the system,
including spam and legitimate emails. It is defined as follows.
A =
nl→l + ns→s
nl + ns
(1.6)
where nl→l means the number of legitimate emails correctly categorized while
nl and ns means the total number of legitimate emails and spam, respectively.
20 Anti-spam Techniques Based on Artificial Immune System
5) Weighted Accuracy
Researchers found that the loss of legitimate emails (incorrectly be filtered
out by the system) means people will miss important information in life, which
may cause more severe consequence than spam being incorrectly categorized.
In order to reflect the importance of legitimate emails, researchers defined the
following formula as the way to calculate the weighted accuracy on the basis
of accuracy.
A =
λnl→l + ns→s
λnl + ns
(1.7)
where λ is the parameter reflecting the importance of legitimate emails.
The larger its value is, the more important the legitimate email is in the
current case. Its value can be 9, 99, or 999. If it is defined as 999, it means
the legitimate email is extremely important in such cases. When its value is
1, the weighted accuracy is equal to the accuracy directly.
6) Fβ Measure
Spam recall and precision can only reflect one aspect of the spam filtering
system, respectively, while one of the two measurements can not reflect the
whole performance of the system. In order to solve this problem, Fβ measure
is viewed as combination of the two measurements and is defined as follows.
Fβ = (1 + β
2)
RsPs
β2Ps +Rs
. (1.8)
where β represents the weighted accuracy reflecting the importance of preci-
sion compared with recall. In most cases, the value of β is 1, and then it is
referred to as F1 measure.
1.5.2 Standard Corpora
In 2000, Androutsopoulos et al. disposed and publicized LingSpam dataset
[11]. This dataset is one of the classic datasets which were publicized earliest:
LingSpam: The dataset contains 2983 emails including 2412 legitimate
emails. The percentage of spam is 16.63%. The emails involved in this dataset
were all processed in advance. Information in the header of emails was all
eliminated (except subject). The mark of html was also been eliminated. But
the deficit of this dataset is that most of the emails are on linguistics which
means using this dataset to evaluate spam detection system could bring about
an over optimistic estimate.
In 2004, Androusopoulos et al. [13] collected, disposed and publicized clas-
sic datasets of PU series, which are now being widely used to evaluate various
spam filtering systems. PU series contain four individual datasets below.
PU1: It contains 1099 emails, of which 481 are spam. All emails are
normally-written English emails. Legitimate emails were collected in 36
months by the author firstly referred and spam emails were collected by him
in later 22 months.
Anti-spam Technologies 21
PU2: It contains 721 emails, of which 142 are spam. Similar to PU1, emails
in this dataset are also in English. One of the colleagues of the author firstly
referred collected these emails in 22 months.
PU3: It contains 4139 emails, of which 1826 are spam. Contrast to PU1
and PU2, this dataset covers emails both in English and in other languages.
Legitimate emails in this dataset were collected by the second author while
spam were cited from other datasets.
PUA: This one contains 1142 emails, 572 of which were spam. Like PU3,
this dataset contains some emails in other languages and spam were from
other datasets. Legitimate emails were collected by another colleague.
Medlock [130] disposed and publicized another large-scale email dataset
called GenSpam.
GenSpam: It was composed of three parts. Part one is dataset for training
including 8018 legitimate emails and 31235 spam. Part two is dataset for
testing including 754 legitimate emails and 797 spam emails. Part three is
dataset for self-adaption including 300 spam and 300 legitimate emails, which
are used to detect the dynamic and self-adaption features of spam filtering
systems.
Dataset ZH1 is a Chinese email dataset [241]. Chinese words in the emails
have been separated. After such processing, the words were reflected as integer
so as to protect email users’ privacy.
ZH1: This dataset contains 1633 emails, of which 433 are legitimate emails
and the percentage of spam is 73.79%. The average length of legitimate emails
covers 819.06 words. The average length of spam covers 819.06 words. The
shortest spam is 819.06 words long while the longest is 32810 words long.
1.6 Summary
In the current anti-spam techniques, intelligent spam detection methods are
the most effective and promising approaches. Nevertheless, legal means and
simple techniques can also play a role on some spam conforming to the defined
characteristics, while it is difficult for the email protocol methods to be put
into practice due to the high cost.
Feature extraction approach is the core part of an intelligent spam detec-
tion system, which plays a decisive role on the performance of classification.
The research on newly proposed and improved feature extraction approaches
will greatly promote the development of anti-spam technologies. The intelli-
gent spam detection is wholly a new type of anti-spam techniques developed
on the basis of the traditional simple anti-spam techniques. Currently, ma-
chine learning methods are widely used in the field of intelligent anti-spam
and achieve high performance. Research on machine learning methods, espe-

cially classification techniques, and their application in spam filtering has a
bright prospect in future development.

Artificial Immune System (AIS) is an inter-discipline research area that aims
to build computational intelligence models by taking inspiration from Biolog-
ical Immune System (BIS). This chapter first gives some knowledge of BIS
and briefly introduces the origin and developments of AIS. Then, several AIS
models are described in detail. Afterward, this chapter summarizes the main
features and applications of AIS. Finally, the AIS-based anti-spam is presented
and detailed.
2.1 Introduction
People have a keen interest on the biosphere since ancient times and have
gotten inspiration from the structures and functions of biological systems and
their regulatory mechanisms continuously. Since mid-20th century, researchers
have focused on the simulation of the biological systems, especially the struc-
tures and functions of human beings. For examples, artificial neural network
is to simulate the structure of the nerve system of human brain, fuzzy control
is very similar to the fuzzy thinking and inaccurate reasoning of human be-
23

ings, and evolutionary computation algorithms are the direct simulations of
the evolved processes of natural creatures.
In recent years, biological immune system has become an emerging bio-
informatics research area. The immune system is a complex system consisting
of organs, cells and molecules. The immune system is able to recognize the
stimulation of “self” and “non-self”, make a precise response, and retain the
memory. It turns out from many researches that the immune system is of a
variety of functions such as pattern recognition, learning, memory acquisition,
diversity, fault-tolerant, distributed detection and so on.
These attractive properties of the biological immune system have drawn
extensive attention of engineering researchers who have proposed many nov-
el algorithms and techniques based on those principles of immunology. After
introducing the concept of immunity, many researches in engineering have
obtained more and more promising results, such as computer network secu-
rity, intelligent robots, intelligent control and pattern recognition and fault
diagnosis. These researches and applications not only can help us to further
understand the immune system itself, but also to re-examine and solve practi-
cal engineering problems from the perspective of information processing way
in biological immune system.
Building a computer security system in principle of the immune system
opens a new research field of information security. Many structure, functions
and mechanisms of the immune system are very helpful and referential to the
research of computer security, such as antibody diversity, dynamic coverage
and distribution. We believe that the excellent features of the immune system
are the roots and original springs for us to build perfect computer security
systems.
2.2 Biological Immune System
2.2.1 Overview
Biological immune system (BIS) is a highly complex, distributed, and paral-
leled natural system with multiple levels, which can identify the “self”, exclude
the “non-self”, for maintaining the security and stability in the biological en-
vironment. It makes use of the innate immunity and adaptive immunity to
generate accurate immune response against the invading antigens outside. BIS
is robust to noise, distributed, self-organized, non-central control and having
enhanced memory [37]. The original substance in an organism is called as
“self” such as normal cells. The non-original substance in the organism is
called as “non-self” like the invading antigens.
BIS consists of innate immunity (also known as non-specific immune) sys-
tem and adaptive immunity (also known as specific immune) system. The two
