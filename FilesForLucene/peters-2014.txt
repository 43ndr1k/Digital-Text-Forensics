 abstract
Students nowadays often use various types of information, text, video, images, 
and audio found on the web in their writing assignments. They use a variety of 
digital-scrapbooking strategies to do so: finding information, evaluating it, and 
analyzing it in order to determine its relevance to their topic, taking notes, and 
then integrating the information through paraphrasing or quotations in their own 
work. Some will reference the authors whose work they have used; others will 
plagiarize, omitting any mention of their sources. 
 In this survey-driven study, third-year students registered in a business Eng-
lish program at a Chinese University were surveyed about their information-
searching strategies and their digital-scrapbooking strategies for their writing 
assignments. Likewise, students’ perceptions of what they were taught about 
digital-scrapbooking strategies and copyright were examined. Results show that 
students’ writing habits have changed; even though they frequently use the web 
to find information for their assignments, they are not as efficient as they could 
be in their use of digital-scrapbooking strategies. While their teachers might tend 
to neglect teaching digital-scrapbooking strategies, such as paraphrasing, they do 
teach referencing, and they seem to warn students about plagiarism.
1. introduction 
Before the turn of the century, being literate meant knowing how to read and write 
(Weis, 2004). Today, being literate implies a whole new set of skills: being able 
to access, analyze, and evaluate information in order to produce messages across 
a variety of contexts, including the internet. Thus, the ability to communicate 
efficiently through writing is an essential skill in order to live and flourish in the 
21st century. 
 In the school system, the introduction of technology has changed how students 
learn and write. Technology has become a part of students’ academic toolkit (Gib-
246 digitaL-sCrapbOOKing strategies and pLagiarisM
bons, 2007) as they have adopted various ways to communicate in writing, from 
the more traditional word processor to email, blogs, forums, and text messages. 
Learners have access to a wide variety of information—text, video, images, and 
audio on the internet that they can use as source material for their writing tasks. 
Students use digital-scrapbooking strategies to collage this information to write 
their assignments. They find websites related to the desired topic and analyze and 
evaluate them in order to select pertinent information. They then take notes and 
assimilate the various bits and pieces of information in order to integrate it into 
their own writing. While most teachers consider using information in this way 
to be plagiarism, there are others who consider that writing assignments in this 
manner demonstrates new and innovative ways to use the resources available to 
them (Ryberg & Dirckinck-Holmfeld, 2008). Information found on the web can 
be integrated in a student’s work as long as it is quoted or paraphrased and the 
author is referenced; otherwise, we consider it to be plagiarism.
 In this chapter, we examine how college students find and use information from 
the web for their writing assignments. We also investigate both the origins of stu-
dents’ digital-scrapbooking strategies and their knowledge about plagiarism. In 
the section below, we define the four key concepts for this paper: digital literacy, 
information seeking, digital-scrapbooking strategies, and plagiarism. We then ex-
plain the method for the study and present our results. Finally, we conclude with 
recommendations for teachers.
2. background
2.1 digital Literacy
At the beginning of the 20th century, the concept of literacy was associated with 
the ability to write your name. Later, the definition was broadened to include 
reading. In 1970, the concept of information literacy appeared, and it included the 
ability to find, evaluate, and use information (Weis, 2004). Then towards the end 
of 1990, the concepts of digital literacy, technological literacy, or online literacy 
surfaced (Dhillon, 2007). According to Jenkins, Purushotma, Clinton, Weigel, and 
Robinson (2006), the traditional skills of reading and writing constitute the foun-
dation of the new skills of digital literacy that rely on various types of documents. 
Digital literacy skills today are not limited to written texts but also include imag-
es, sounds, animations, and videos. Students must become competent not only to 
read multimedia texts but also to navigate in a confusing and complex cyberspace 
in order to find what they seek (Brown, 2000).
 Jenkins et al. (2006) argue that digital literacy skills include social skills, that 
is to say, they are more than a mere collection of skills used for the acquisition of 
information or for personal expression. This implies changes in working habits, 
values, and practices that are now more participatory and collaborative. Students 
need to develop new ways to interact with the sources of information available 
through the use of technology (Lankshear & Knobel, 2007). According to these 
authors, new textual forms are constantly emerging, and they are less often pub-
lished on paper, less often written by a single author, and less individual. The need 
Martine peters and Mary franKOff 247
for expertise in order to be published is also disappearing. Indeed, since most 
writers can now be read by the general public simply by displaying their text on 
the internet, there is no longer a need to be an expert or a writer. Lessig (2004) 
stated that currently, information flows much more freely and is therefore free to 
be used and reused. “Writing is becoming ever more central and crucial to the 
world of work, with computers on every desk, email and the Internet adding to the 
world’s written work in almost epidemic proportions” (Davies & Birbili, 2000, 
p. 430). This abundance of information does not do away with the obligation to 
quote sources. With more and more people writing, the study of digital literacy 
skills is an emerging area of inquiry. Researchers are interested in how texts are 
being written, and specifically in our case, how information is found and used in 
the texts being produced by students.
2.2 information-seeking strategies
There is so much information available on the internet that today’s students au-
tomatically tend to search the web when they are looking for information (Foster 
& Gibbons, 2007). The ability to be instantly linked to the internet at all times is 
expected. Statistics show that 71% of Canadian students use the internet for their 
schoolwork (Clark, 2001). According to Burton and Chadwick (2000), 66% of 
students questioned reported never having been trained on how to evaluate infor-
mation found on the internet. Many students have expressed the wish to be trained 
by their teachers to evaluate the relevance, value, and credibility of information 
they find on the internet (Roy, 2009). Manual (2002) found that students who 
search for information on the internet have typically scan rather than read infor-
mation. They skip from one website to another, and many teachers worry about 
the small amount of time used by students to search for and read information that 
will be the most relevant for their written assignments (Loertscher, 2008). 
 Foster and Gibbons (2007) have found that students judge the validity of the 
site by its popularity, while Fitzgerald’s research (2004) established that students 
attribute the same validity to sources found online that they do to printed resourc-
es. This can be a problem since numerous websites contain incorrect or mislead-
ing information. Burton and Chadwick (2000) mention that the first three criteria 
high school and college students use when seeking information to write a paper 
are all based on the ease with which information can be found, obtained, and 
understood. This leads to what Lessig (2004) has called the culture of “copy and 
paste,” facilitated by the easy access to information with technology.
2.3 digital-scrapbooking strategies
Today, once students have found the information needed for their writing assign-
ments, they remix the information into a new text. Ryberg and Dirckinck-Holm-
feld (2008, p. 145) have used the metaphor of patchworking to describe the way 
students will assemble different pieces of material to create a new text. However, 
patchworking refers to the use of only one type of material. We therefore prefer 
the term digital scrapbooking since it accounts for the various types of informa-
248 digitaL-sCrapbOOKing strategies and pLagiarisM
tion students will use (e.g., text, audio, video, and images) to write their paper. 
According to Ryberg and Dirckinck-Holmfeld (2008), students will combine, as-
semble, modify, and weave this information into a whole new creation. Moreover, 
the authors explain that these creative processes require critical thinking on the 
part of learners.
 For some students, the process of digital scrapbooking may seem quite natu-
ral, and it involves much more than just copying and pasting information. It is a 
constructive, creative, and productive process since the text is constantly being 
amended by adding new information. Carrington and Marsh (2008) argue that 
increased access to information in various forms will allow for greater student 
creativity. Lankshear and Knobel (2006) argue that technology facilitates this new 
way of writing, and students’ ability to remix, assemble, reformulate, and recon-
textualize therefore becomes very important. 
 However, this new way of learning and expressing oneself must be accompa-
nied by the development of skills to analyze and evaluate the relevance of sources 
to enable individuals to make effective choices regarding the information they 
need. Developing the ability to make sound judgments is essential to being a good 
“scrapbooker” (Brown, 2000). According to Jenkins et al. (2006), there is another 
digital-scrapbooking strategy: appropriation. According to these authors, students 
must undo what the original authors of the text, video, and images have created by 
extracting what they understand and what they want to use into their own creation.
 For many teachers, students who use digital-scrapbooking strategies to write 
papers choose the easy way, one which does not require critical judgment and 
comes dangerously close to plagiarism. Ryberg and Dirckinck-Holmfeld (2008), 
however, documented evidence to show that, when using digital-scrapbooking 
strategies, students have opportunities to use complex processes—including criti-
cal thinking skills—to produce a catchy new text.
 According to Carrington and Marsh (2008), teachers can no longer limit them-
selves to the teaching of writing, but must also instil in their students a set of skills 
leading to the creation of new content by using various information collected 
on the internet. Olher (2009) explains that “[g]eneral literacy means being able 
to read and write the media forms of the day, which currently means being able 
to construct an articulate, meaningful, navigable media collage” (p. 10). Olher 
also stresses the importance of integrating traditional literacies and emerging lit-
eracies, which rely heavily on the technique of “remix culture” (see also Lamb, 
2007).
 The challenge for teachers lies in the overlap of two cultures, that of the “ remix 
culture” and that of the school system which prohibits plagiarism. The percep-
tions of students and teachers with regard to this new way of creating texts dif-
fer greatly. Students who use technology and digital-scrapbooking strategies to 
complete their school assignments see this procedure as a natural practice (Jukes, 
2008). Teachers, on the other hand, believe this is not a new creation, but in-
stead plagiarism. Furthermore, they believe it violates copyright laws as well as 
the principles promoted by the school (Giezendanner, 2007). However, several 
Martine peters and Mary franKOff 249
authors (Lankshear & Knobel, 2007; Lessig, 2004) argue that “remix” or digi-
tal scrapbooking is creative since the choice of information and its arrangement 
make it into a new creation. These same authors are very explicit about the impor-
tance of teaching students how to cite their sources. Like many authors working in 
this field of specialization, Jenkins et al. (2006) warn against the dangers of failing 
to inform young people about the legal issues that this practice entails. Palfrey, 
Gasser, Simun, and Barnes (2009) reported that learning the importance of under-
standing and respecting the rights of authors should be done as soon as possible in 
school. Doing so will enable students to develop sensitivity and awareness in the 
exercise of their legal rights when they use other people’s content in their digital 
scrapbooking. The authors explain that by encouraging creativity among students, 
they will develop a respect for other people’s creations and will be more aware 
of the importance of assigning copyright to those whose works they have used in 
their own creations (Palfrey et al.).
2.4 plagiarism
Definitions of plagiarism are plentiful, and Bretag and Mahmud (2009, p. 50) 
explain that the abundance of definitions is due to the “complexity of factors 
influencing its occurrence” including “the fact that plagiarism is often conflated 
with cheating and academic misconduct generally.” For the purpose of this paper, 
plagiarism is defined as the appropriation of someone else’s words or ideas and 
presenting that material as one’s own. There are numerous types of plagiarism the 
most common ones cited in the literature are direct plagiarism, which is a simple 
copy and paste of exact words (Klausman, 1999; Walker, 2010); idea plagiarism 
in which students use someone else’s work without quoting it (Stamatatos, 2001); 
trying to paraphrase an author yet in reality effecting few changes (Allan, Calla-
gher, Connors, Joyce, & Rees, 2005; Kakkonen & Mozgovoy, 2010); and submit-
ting a complete paper written by someone else (Park, 2003; Shei, 2005).
 Unfortunately, plagiarism has become a quagmire for many teachers and 
schools. Research by Owunwanne, Rustagi, and Dada (2010) shows that plagia-
rism is considered acceptable and practiced widely by students (see also Gullifer 
& Tyson, 2010). Not surprisingly, research has also found that copyright issues 
are seldom taught in high school or college (McGowan & Lightbody, 2008). As a 
result, many students do not know how to quote or paraphrase properly, leading 
to unintentional plagiarism (Mittermeyer & Quirion, 2003). The use of the web as 
a source of information has facilitated plagiarism because students often have dif-
ficulty knowing what, when, and how to quote (Baruchson-Arbib & Yaari, 2004). 
Plagiarism is usually punished when detected, but many researchers indicate 
that punishment is not a long-term solution and that teaching about plagiarism 
and how to avoid it would be a better solution (Scanlon, 2003). Hollandsworth, 
Dowdy, and Donovan (2011) explain that students must develop the knowledge 
and skills to become good digital citizens, citizens who use technology appropri-
ately and are aware of the consequences of their actions.

3. research Questions 
The present study was designed to investigate the habits of students with regard 
to their use of digital-scrapbooking strategies, including information-searching 
strategies and what they have been taught about these strategies. Specifically, the 
following questions guided this study:
1. How do students search for information for their writing assignments?
2. How do students use digital-scrapbooking strategies while writing assign-
ments? 
3. What are students taught about digital-scrapbooking strategies and copy-
right?
4. Method
Data were collected over the course of a term (i.e., 15 weeks) in a writing class. 
The participants were third-year students (N = 90), registered in a business Eng-
lish program in a Chinese university. Almost all students (91%) were between 
the ages of 20 to 25, and 93% of the students were women. More than two thirds 
(84%) had access to a computer at home or in the dormitory, and 81% indicated 
that they used their computer daily. When questioned about their teachers’ use of 
instructional technologies in their classes, 63% stated that technology was used 
daily in class. 
	 Three	instruments	were	used	to	collect	data	from	the	participants.	The	first	was	
a	demographic	questionnaire	with	five	items	about	age,	sex,	first	and	second	lan-
guages spoken, program of study, and number of years at the university level. The 
second questionnaire contained 11 items about the students’ use of technology 
and their level of comfort and skills using technology. In the last questionnaire, 
participants answered 46 questions about their digital-scrapbooking strategies, 
their information-searching habits, their writing habits, and what they knew about 
plagiarism. The data from the questionnaire were analyzed with descriptive statis-
tics. 
5. Results
Results	are	organised	 in	 three	sections	below.	The	first	examines	how	students	
conduct their information searches. The second concentrate on the digital-scrap-
booking	strategies	used	by	students	when	writing	their	assignments,	specifically	
planning their information search and reevaluating the information they found. 
The third section presents results pertaining to the help, information, or training 
with the digital-scrapbooking strategies students receive from their teachers on 
writing assignments that require information seeking. 
5.1 Information Searches by Students
The	 first	 research	 question	 focuses	 on	 the	 frequency	 with	 which	 the	 students	
search for information during a term (see Table 1).

 Over 64% of students indicated that they have to search for information more 
than	five	times	a	term	(see	Després-Lonnet	&	Courtecuisse,	2006;	Le	Douarin	&	
Delaunay-Téterel,	2011).	Thirty-two	percent	of	the	students	search	for	informa-
tion less than 5 times per term, which might be due to certain course content or to 
teachers not making information-seeking assignments. However, this represents 
only	a	third	of	the	students;	most	students	is	search	very	frequently	for	informa-
tion.
 Slightly more than half the students indicated that they use technology daily to 
search for information (see Table 2).

 Only two students indicated rarely using or not using technology to search for 
information. Students seem to look online for information because it is easier 
to	find	and	more	easily	accessible	than	in	books	(Agosto,	2002;	Le	Douarin	&	
Delaunay-Téterel,	2011;	Thompson,	Schmidt,	&	Davis,	2003).	The	ease	and	the	
accessibility	of	information	on	the	web	might	be	why	all	of	the	students	expressed	
having positive or very positive personal feelings when questioned about infor-
mation seeking on the internet (see Table 3).

	 This	 “Google	generation”	 (Le	Douarin	&	Delaunay-Téterel,	 2011)	 is	 clearly	
comfortable using technology and the web to search for information. Once stu-
dents have found the information they need, how do they integrate it into their 
writing assignments?
5.2 Digital-Scrapbooking Strategies Used While Doing Writing Assignments
In	this	section,	we	examine	two	digital-scrapbooking	strategies	students	use	when	
writing assignments: planning their information search and reevaluating the in-
formation found. 
 Writing outlines or drafts is not a priority for almost a quarter of the students 
(23%) questioned, and only a third do so once or twice a term. However, 37% of 
the students write a draft or an outline three times or more during a term (see Table 
4).

 When preparing an assignment that required information seeking, students 
might choose not to prepare an outline because they know what information they 
need to write their paper and do not feel the need to prepare to search. Agosto 
Martine peters and Mary franKOff 253
(2002) indicates that many students always use keywords when searching for in-
formation and so have only one method when searching for information. It is pos-
sible then that they do not feel the need to prepare for their search with an outline 
since their method never varies (Boubée, 2011). Those who do write outlines 
might do so because they use a variety of searching methods such as advance 
searches (Kennedy & Judd, 2011) and wish to be better prepared for their infor-
mation search. 
 Once they have found information and have starting writing their assignments, 
do students reevaluate the information to validate its pertinence? Almost all of the 
participants (94%) indicated that they do reevaluate the information gathered at 
least once per term (see Table 5).

ments?

 Students might feel the need to reevaluate the information because they did not 
find the correct information or information that otherwise seems valid (Agosto, 
2002; Le Douarin & Delaunay-Téterel, 2011). There is so much information on 
the web, and the technical skills they have acquired outside of formal learning 
contexts are sometimes difficult to transfer in a school context (Fluckiger & Bruil-
lard, 2008) in order to properly evaluate their sources of information (Le Douarin 
& Delaunay-Téterel, 2011). If certain skills acquired outside of school are not 
easily transferable to a school setting, what of the skills acquired in school? 
5.3 Help, information, or training with the digital scrapbooking-strategies 
students receive from teachers
Students might need extra help, information, or training from their teachers when 
writing assignments. How often do they receive it? The results displayed in Table

	 Approximately	 53%	 of	 the	 students	 rarely	 (once	 or	 twice	 a	 term)	 or	 never	
seek information from their teacher. This might be because they feel confortable 
searching for information or simply because they have understood the assign-
ment. Yet almost 43% of the students ask for help, perhaps because they need to 
be	reassured	that	they	are	heading	in	the	right	direction	or	lack	self-confidence	
(Eccles	&	Wigfield,	2002).	Another	possible	interpretation	is	that	the	subject	mat-
ter	is	difficult	for	them.	Others	might	need	help	with	technology	to	complete	the	
assignment (Tabary-Bolka, 2009) if there is little information available about the 
topic.
 When asked if they had been taught how to complete a writing assignment, 
17% of the participants chose never, while another 50% selected 1-2 times per 
term (see Table 7). Only 25% of the participants stated that teachers give instruc-
tions sometimes (3-5 times per term) or often (more than 5 times per term).

 It seems that these students’ teachers give some training on how to write a 
research	 paper	 but	 not	 very	 regularly;	 only	 25%	 of	 the	 students	mention	 that	
this	is	done	more	than	3-5	times	a	term.	It	is	quite	possible	that	teachers	expect	
students to have learned this prior to college since the high school program has 
cross-disciplinary	competencies	specific	to	writing	research	papers	(Ministère	de	
l’Éducation, 2006). However, since those competencies are generic and not sub-
ject	specific,	it	is	possible	that	it	is	not	addressed	in	detail	in	high	school.	College	
students,	if	they	are	not	taught	how	to	do	research,	then	have	to	“figure	it	out”	or	
ask for help when they need it. Unfortunately, our results show that students rarely 
ask for help. 
 Table 8 shows the same pattern when students are asked if their teachers show 
them	how	to	evaluate	the	information	they	find.

 The number of students (42; 35%) who say they have never received some form 
of training to evaluate the information they find is much higher than it should be 
in an ideal setting. This means that approximately one third of the students have 
to learn how to evaluation information by themselves, and many do so; 94% of 
the participants indicated that they reevaluate at least once a semester (see Table 
5 above). Another one third of the students (37%) mention having been shown 
how to evaluate the information they find once or twice a semester, which echoes 
Hayes, Hurtt, and Bee’s (2006) recommendation that all teachers should give 
training at the beginning of the year on information evaluation. 
 The proportion of students who reported never having been taught to para-
phrase is slightly lower (33%) than those who indicated they have never been 
trained to evaluate information (see Table 9).

 Almost 50% of the students state that they have been trained to paraphrase once 
or twice a semester. However, only 15% of students declare that their teachers 
have shown them how to paraphrase more than 3 times a term. One possible rea-
son is that college teachers expect students to have been taught how to paraphrase 
in high school and think that students only need a reminder, not a complete lesson, 
on paraphrasing. Unfortunately, Tabary-Bolka’s results (2009) show that students 
do not know how to respect copyright and use authors’ ideas without proper ref-
erencing. It is then surprising to see in Table 10 that teachers have shown the vast 
majority of participants (84%) how to give their references in their writing assign-
ments at least once or twice per term.

 It seems that most teachers frequently talk about plagiarism since only 3% of 
students claimed they had never heard about it from teachers. Thirty-five percent 
of the participants said that they heard about plagiarism more than five times per 
term. One student even stated—in the area provided for optional comments—that 
teachers always explain plagiarism.
 The number of writing assignments students have to write every term can prob-
ably explain the high frequency of explanations given about plagiarism. Hayes et 
al. (2006) state that teachers usually talk about plagiarism on the first day of the 
term and subsequently every time students are given explanations about writing 
assignments. Teachers are aware of students’ information search habits and how 
easy it is for them to copy and paste information from the internet. It seems to fol-
low that warning students about plagiarism and explaining it may indeed help to 
prevent it. Teachers also deem it necessary to warn students of the consequences 
of plagiarism as shown in Table 12.

 According to the participants, teachers put more emphasis on warning them 
about plagiarism than on explaining what its consequences can be. The frequency 
is not as high when it comes to explaining about consequences, probably because

teachers might not be aware of how to detect plagiarism (Pickard, 2006) or even 
how to apply the school policy when faced with plagiarism (Carpenter, Harding, 
Finelli, Montgomery, & Passow, 2006; Macdonald & Carroll, 2006)2006.
6. discussion
The results presented here show that students frequently search for information to 
write their school assignments. That they are using technology to do so is hardly 
surprising. A study by Després-Lonnet and Courtecuisse (2006) has shown that 
students do not know how to find books at the library. Some will even go to Ama-
zon or Wikipedia to find information about books and then head to the library to 
try and find them. 
 Students in our study indicated that they like using the internet to look for in-
formation. One possible reason is that they find it much more quickly online than 
in the library, especially in difficult circumstances.
Classrooms are information-poor environments. Thirty copies of the same, 
outdated book is not good enough, and the yearly $200 available to the 
school’s library for all the subjects for new acquisitions is not going to do it 
either. And, in these times of cutbacks, we can’t expect the public library to 
be particularly responsive. Where else are kids going to get the information 
resources they need but from the Web? (Soloway & Wallace, 1997, p.11) 
The internet includes websites that offer frequently asked questions (FAQs) and 
tips to help students find information. While there are thousands of websites avail-
able at all times of day and night, the school library can be quite limited (Després-
Lonnet & Courtecuisse, 2006; Le Douarin & Delaunay-Téterel, 2011).
 Some authors (Agosto, 2002; Bennett, 2012; Le Douarin& Delaunay-Téterel, 
2011) claim that students have difficulties finding what they are searching for. 
This might explain why our participants frequently look for information. They 
might find information and realize, as they are writing their paper, that the in-
formation is not relevant, which might explain why they often feel the need to 
reevaluate the information they have found. 
 Another reason they might often look for information is the fact that most of 
them do not seem to plan what they are going to write, and so their search for 
information might not be as efficient as it could be. Making an outline or any kind 
of rough draft can help define the broad lines of a paper and subsequently orient 
the search for information. Unfortunately, this is not a scrapbooking strategy that 
is often used by our participants. 
 It would seem that the participants described in this chapter have developed 
some level of digital literacy skills. While few plan their writing assignments, they 
can still search for information, find what they need, and reevaluate this informa-
tion as they write. However, students might not be as digitally literate as they 
could be. College teachers may expect their students to have learned how to search 
the internet for information and how to evaluate it in high school. This is possibly 
because some teachers may not actually have the necessary knowledge to teach 
the technical aspects of looking for information on the web (Fluckiger & Bruil-
Martine peters and Mary franKOff 259
lard, 2008). Teachers must be comfortable with technology in order to teach stu-
dents digital literacy and scrapbooking strategies. Our results show that students 
are much more frequently warned against plagiarising than they are helped with its 
prevention. Macdonald and Carroll (2006) frame this issue in the following way: 
[Students] have responsibilities as to what are inappropriate practices, but [in 
the UK’s Quality Assurance Agency (QAA) code of practice, there is noth-
ing] about the responsibilities of institutions to ensure that students have the 
necessary skills to avoid plagiarism, or on staff to consider how best to mi-
nimise the opportunities for it through their assessment practices. (p. 235) 
 Students need to be taught—not just once or twice a term, but as each time they 
prepare a writing assignment—about searching for information, paraphrasing, 
and referencing (Hayes et al., 2006). Teachers cannot limit themselves to teaching 
writing since they also need to instil in their students the skills needed to create 
new content with the information they find on the internet (Carrington & Marsh, 
2008). Some teachers might too often assume that students have been taught ei-
ther in high school or by other teachers; however, this, unfortunately, does not 
seem to be the case (Fluckiger & Bruillard, 2007).
 In order for teachers to see the importance of teaching digital-scrapbooking 
strategies, they must be trained to do so. Pickard (2006) suggests that teachers 
need workshops to learn how to prevent plagiarism, and institutions must play a 
role not only in training teachers but also in putting forward clear regulations for 
teachers to follow (Carpenter et al., 2006; Macdonald & Carroll, 2006) in order 
to help teachers apply rules and teach students the digital skills they need to do a 
research paper, which would, in turn, diminish the level of plagiarism (McCabe 
& Treviño, 1993). According to Palfrey et al. (2009), students need to learn as 
early as possible how to respect copyright, and this implies teaching them digital 
literacy skills and scrapbooking strategies.
7. Conclusion
Further research in the area of digital-patchworking strategies needs to be done 
in order to understand why students are inclined to copy and paste rather than use 
these strategies to create their own writing assignments while giving credit to the 
authors whose content and/or ideas they use. Data from a variety of sources (e.g., 
interviews and writing journals) could certainly provide in-depth insights into 
specific new habits and practices that some students have developed. 
 These writing habits seem to have changed with the appearance of an abun-
dance of information available on the web, and, as teachers, we need to be aware 
of these changes. Rather than lament the fact that many of our students are copy-
ing and pasting information in their writing assignments, we need to be proactive 
and tap into these new digital skills that students have acquired. It is our respon-
sibility to foster the development of these skills by teaching digital-scrapbooking 
strategies in order to ensure that our students will become digitally literate and 
will be prepared for learning, working, and communicating in the 21st century.
