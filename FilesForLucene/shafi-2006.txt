• ABSTRACT 
The paper discusses the design of an interface for developing a 
• database of 'medieval manuscripts' for accommodating data elements in 
multilingual and multiscript medium especially in Arabic, Urdie, and 
Persian using 'Unicode character sets' with Visual Basic in front end and 
Ms Access in back end. 
KEY WORDS 
Unicode, Multilingual Interface, Medieval Manuscripts. 
INTRODUCTION 
Museums, archives'-and libraries collect information sources in a variety of 
rare and fragile media and many institutions and libraries have undertaken 
initiatives to exploit the potential of digital technology for archiving, 
retrieving and displaying such unique and fragile materials. Medieval

manuscripts, rich sources of culture and history, are available in different 
formats like parchment, vellum, palm leaves, paper, birch bark, papyrus, 
wood, stones etc.. languages and scripts in various collection sizes and 
conditions. The advancement in information technology have made it 
possible to preserve, organize and disseminate them in more economic and 
effective way. With fast developments in software and database 
management systems to design a database in various languages/scripts has 
become more convenient and possible. It is with this background that 
present paper reports designing of an interface for a multilingual database 
of medieval manuscripts. 
PROBLEM 
a) Most interfaces are usually in English language. Therefore, 
exploring possibility of developing an interface for non-roman 
language and script has become necessary. 
b) The absence of interface in non-roman scripts especially 
`Urdu language' creates problem for accessing, editing, retrieving 
information to many 'Urdu language' literate users. 
c) The non-roman script languages are written and accessed 
from right to left but interfaces are mostly available for left to right 
script languages/scripts. 
SCOPE 
The present study, besides English language, is confined to non-
roman languages particularly Arabic, Persian and Urdu languages/scripts.

OBJECTIVES 
The following objectives are laid down for the study: 
a) To design an interface for multilingual /multiscript database 
of medieval manuscripts. 
b) To populate data for evaluating the interface for addition, 
deletion, edition and retrieval of non-roman records. 
LITERATURE REVIEW 
The literature surveyed identifies a number of papers on Unicode 
standard but a few on manuscript interfaces. Chandraker (2004) points 
out that issue of localization of library and museum databases has surfaced 
with the advent of digital libraries and their interoperability. He argues for 
Unicode as a multilingual standard and discusses the related technology 
available for localizing Indian language materials.Tull & Starley (2003) 
support the use of Unicode as a standard for global exchange of textual 
information with facility for display and searching of information. The 
concept is further extended by Jilvoskey & Cunningham (2005) from a 
practical and technical perspective especially in multilingual cataloguing 
with more emphasis on issues like storage and conversion, data input and 
display.Chandraker (2002) has highlighted the technological perspective 
of digitization of valuable resources like manuscripts with more emphasis 
on multilingual database creation. Michos ,Stamatatos & Fakotakis 
(1999) have made a case for making full advantage of Artificial 
Intelligence based methods for digitization by putting forward a 
multilingual information system consisting of an integration of new and

Designing an Interface 	 Shafi & Nadim 
existing multilingual information tools with high user friendliness, low 
cost maintenance and improved search results.Shafi (2004, (a) )further 
supports the use of modern information tools for digitization of medieval 
manuscripts for retrieval purposes, indulging into different techniques and 
aspects of architecture of digital library and its implementations.Rampler 
and Calabretto(1999) demonstrates the use of active X ,CGI and java 
based approach for designing a Virtual library for manuscripts. Shafi 
(2004, (b)) extends the concept by highlighting the importance of 
digitization of manuscripts by focusing on technical and planning issues of 
digital process and role of metadata. Cathro (2001) emphasises the need 
for managing traditional and digital collections including texts in different 
scripts in an integrated manner with an aim for providing persistent access 
to digital information. 
METHODS AND MATERIALS 
Visual Basic 6.0. is selected as a front end and MS Access as a 
back end or data base store keeping in view their obvious and well known 
benefits in data processing applications associated with the use of DBMS 
technology and associated techniques such as entity relationship modeling. 
Unicode, a universal character set for expressing the world's languages and 
character scripts is used to enable the non-roman script as well as Bi 
directional (BIDI) feature. 
The following procedure was adopted for creating the application: 
■ Case studies regarding various issues related with the creation of 
digital Libraries of Manuscripts were thoroughly studied especially 
TRIM V2 (2) July-recember, 2006 	 120 
Designing an Interface 	 Shaft & Nadim 
Digital Library for Ottoman Manuscripts and C-DAC (Bangalore ) 
and European project BAMBI. 
■ A thorough study for providing multilingual approach to the 
manuscript database was'carried out and various issues concerning 
the design of a multilingual interface were resolved. 
■ Microsoft Access is used as it can take an approach based on 
OLEDLL, which helped to read the appropriate strings from the 
resource file. 
■ Every control in the system include text Labels, Combo-boxes, 
Text boxes, command buttons. Buttons with text is given a unique 
identifier , used as the key while linking up, the actual text in the 
database. 
■ The data entry forms are created with metadata elements (fields) 
namely Creator, Title, Contributor, languagestyle/script, subject, 
Date of transcription, size, Folios, Lines, Media, Notes, Institutes, 
accession number, see also, sources, state. 
• A user friendly front end interface is developed with proper built in 
message facility for interaction with user navigation, addition, 
deletion and modification of records made possible by providing 
command buttons.., 
• Programming for each control is written for the proper 
functionality. Security is ensured for data entry or manipulation so 
that only authenticated users can add or delete data. 
TRIM V2 (2) July-December, 2006 	 121 
Designing an Interface 	 Shafi & Nadim 
■ Data was added, saved and manipulated on many occasions and 
tested for various operations for satisfaction of the basic purpose of 
developing the interface. 
■ Search for various field items was carried by choosing the desired 
option and the results were analysed for their relevance. 
■ Connectivity with Ms Access provided easy methods of accessing 
various fields by binding them with the help of ADODB control. 
This reduced the redundant coding to greater extent. 
■ The application was tested for Storing and manipulating Unicode 
strings. 
■ The application was tested for handling Unicode-conformant 
collation, normalization, and text boundary. 
■ Display, print and editing of Unicode text was carried out. 
■ The handling of BIDI displays i.e. Right-to-left characters were 
tested at several occasions. 
■ The handling of character shaping for scripts of Arabic and Urdu 
was confirmed. 
METADATA SET FOLLOWED 
The metadata is an issue special and unique in many respects to 
medieval manuscript. There cant be Consensus about the elements to be 
included in the database, though many projects use metadata which range 
from TE1 to MARC21.The Dublin Core Metadata Element is found useful 
as a kind of "Lingua Franca"supporting the discovery of information

resources from a variety of communities.Cathro (2001). The present 
Initiative has followed Dublin Core (DCMES, 1999) which qualifies for 
the increasing the richness and precision of the description Baker, 2000, 
Sugimoto et al, 2001 (as cited in Shafi, 2004) 
FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS 
The usefulness and uniqueness of interface is vividly clear from 
following seven figures. The fig 1.1 displays opening window where one 
can choose menus like data entry in different languages or search options 
to proceed further. The fig 1.2 and 1.3 demonstrate interface for data 
addition, edition and search facilities in English language for Medieval 
Manuscripts. The similar pattern has been followed for non-roman scripts, 
using appropriate terminology in Urdu language for data entry. The fig 
1.4-1.6 displays submenus for addition, deletion and saving of records in 
Urdu language. The last window depicts retrieval mechanism in Urdu 
language.

The design of the multilingual interface for medieval manuscripts 
exhibits the exploitation of the opportunities offered by the Information 
Technology without any constraints for the users with few limitations. 
However, the application software can be further modified using My SQL 
as backend and Java or ASP or VB.net as front end that will allow the 
system to handle bulk of data in a convenient manner. 
The prototype digital interface is a unique as it handles BIDI 
display i.e. Right-to-left characters as application softwares running on 
real environment are still uncommon or unknown. Thus the project has 
enough scope for development on a wider canvas to make it more useful,
