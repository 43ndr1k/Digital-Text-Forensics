direct link must be established between the tax advantage con-
cerned and the offsetting of that advantage by a particular tax 
levy.

27. However, in the present case, not only does the Kingdom of 
Sweden not advance any specific arguments before the Court 
seeking to establish that the provisions of the IL in dispute are 
justified by the need to ensure coherence of the tax system con-
cerning the deferral of taxation on capital gains, but, moreover, in 
its defence, it admits the failure to fulfil obligations of which it is 
accused. Further, it submits that, in order to fulfil its obligations 
under Community law, it is studying a reform of the complex 
rules on deferral of taxation. 
28. According to the case-law, whether a Member State has 
failed to fulfil its obligations must be determined by reference to 
the situation prevailing in the Member State at the end of the pe-
riod laid down in the reasoned opinion, and the Court cannot 
take account of any subsequent changes.
13
 
29. In those circumstances, the provisions of Chapter 47 of the 
IL in dispute must be held to be contrary to Articles 39 EC and 
43 EC. 
30. Secondly, with regard to persons who are not economically 
active, the same conclusion applies, for the same reasons, to the 
complaint relating to Article 18 EC. 
31. The Commission also claims that the Kingdom of Sweden 
has failed to fulfil its obligations under Articles 28 and 31 of the 
EEA Agreement, relating respectively to freedom of movement 
for workers and freedom of establishment. 
32. It is to be noted, in the present case, that the rules prohibit-
ing restrictions on the freedom of movement and the freedom of 
establishment laid down in Articles 28 and 31 of the EEA Agree-
ment are essentially identical to those established by Articles 39 
EC and 43 EC. 
33. Therefore, in the light of the conclusion reached in para. 29 
of the present judgment, the provisions of Chapter 47 of the IL in 
dispute are also contrary to Articles 28 and 31 of the EEA 
Agreement. 
34. The Commission’s action must accordingly be considered to 
be well founded as far as the complaint alleging infringement of 
the rules on freedom of movement for persons in the EEA 
Agreement is concerned. 
35. It must therefore be held that, by adopting and maintaining 
in force tax rules, such as those in Chapter 47 of the IL, which 
make entitlement to deferral of taxation on capital gains arising 
from the sale of a private residential property or of a right to re-
side in a private cooperative building conditional on the newly-
acquired residence also being on Swedish territory, the Kingdom 
of Sweden has failed to fulfil its obligations under Articles 18 EC, 
39 EC and 43 EC and under Articles 28 and 31 of the EEA 
Agreement. 
Free movement of capital 
36. In addition, the Commission seeks a declaration from the 
Court that the Kingdom of Sweden has failed to fulfil its obliga-
tions under Article 56(1) EC and Article 40 of the EEA Agree-
ment. 
37. Since the provisions of the Treaty and the EEA Agreement 
on freedom of movement for persons preclude the contested leg-
islation, there is no need for a separate examination of that legisla-
tion in the light of Article 56(1) EC and Article 40 of the EEA 
Agreement concerning the free movement of capital.

Towards a common understanding of law in a multilanguage world: The role of cross-language le-
gal information retrieval systems  
 
Ginevra Peruginelli* 
 
1. Multilingualism in the law domain: a brief overview* 
Multilingualism is a phenomenon reflecting the plurality of 
languages used by the vast amount of communities world-
wide. Referred to legal information, it is to be intended both 
as a de-facto situation characterized by the existence of differ-
ent legal languages, and as the set of issues involved in the 
management of legal information across language barriers.

e Tecniche dell'Informazione Giuridica del Consiglio Nazionale delle 
Ricerche (ITTIG-CNR), Florence, Italy. 
Internationalisation and increasing globalization of market 
economy and social patterns of life have created a situation 
where the need for legal information from foreign countries 
and from different legal systems is greater than ever before. 
This requirement is not new, but is now becoming more and 
more crucial and hard to meet under the pressure of the rapid 
and complex cross-border transactions occurring between 
people of different legal cultures and languages.  
There is no doubt that the exchange of information is largely 
dependent on languages, to be intended not only as a system

of symbols, but also as a mean of communication
1
 and as a 
tool for mediating between different cultures.
2
  
If we consider the language of the law, such language’s 
properties have a major impact on the exchange of legal in-
formation. In fact the language of the law is the expression of 
legal identities that vary according to systems and countries, 
where different languages are used to express legislation, ju-
risprudence and doctrine as main components of the various 
legal cultures.
3
   
Multilingualism in the law domain is mostly unanimously 
perceived as a very complex issue, linked as it is to disciplines 
such as comparative law, linguistics, translation theory and 
practice. It is a highly debated topic not only among profes-
sionals and scholars of these various disciplines,
4
 but also 
among government officials in institutional settings at national 
and international level.  
Europe is a typical example of multi-language and multi-
system environment where decisions on linguistics’ policy are 
now receiving considerable attention. In the European Union 
a full multilingualism is met by providing a huge translation 
work of legal documentations.
5
 In addition some languages 
such as English, French and German have a special status since 
the majority of the material is to be handled in these three lan-
guages. Due to economic and practical reasons a serious lin-
guistics’ policy is likely to have to choose between two oppo-
site extremes.
6
 These are represented from one side by a multi-
lingualism embracing all European languages and being as eq-
ualitarian as possible (a very expensive solution); on the other 
side by the adoption of a unique language, in particular a sort 
of international English which is already in place in the area of 
international trade and in many areas of the legal doctrine.  
Two major aspects have to be taken into account in dealing 
with cross-language legal information retrieval: one concerns 
the intimate link between language and law and covers the 
crucial issues of rendering legal terms across languages; the 
other refers to comparative issues, to the relationship between 
legal systems which, while a problem in its own, is exacer-
bated in a multi-language environment.

communities and to reach a common understanding of differ-
ent legal systems has inevitably to cope with the problems 
posed by language and systems’ diversity. 
2. Access to legal information across languages 
Access to legal information across languages is intended as 
the functionality allowing the retrieval, through the use of 
information systems, of meaningful legal material beyond 
the barriers of languages and legal orders’ differences.  
Cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) is defined as 
the capability for users to retrieve material written/expressed 
in a language different from a query language.
7
 Cross-
language information retrieval is not to be simply associated 
with the need to find documents for people who cannot read 
them. In fact multilingual searchers with a limited active vo-
cabulary, but good reading comprehension in a second lan-
guage, might prefer to issue single queries into a multilingual 
collection in their most fluent language. Information re-
trieval across languages is an application of information re-
trieval. These two fields share the same goals and a number 
of information retrieval techniques for matching documents 
as well as for processing queries are equally useful in a mul-
tilingual application. However, cross-language retrieval dif-
fers from information retrieval in a significant way as the 
standard monolingual information retrieval process involves 
no translation component. 
The requirements of a cross-language information retrieval 
system can be clarified by stating that in a multilingual ac-
cess environment information is searched, retrieved and pre-
sented effectively, without constraints due to the different 
languages and scripts used in the material to be searched and 
in the metadata (that is bibliographic and semantic indexes to 
the material to be found) allowing to search such material. 
This implies that in creating multilingual access services, the 
users’ native language as well as the multiplicity and richness 
of world-wide languages are to be accommodated, and 
methods have to be developed to allow users to put queries 
expressed in any one language and retrieve information re-
sources independently of the language of documents and in-
dexing. 
The main approach is usually based on translating the 
query at retrieval time into the document (or metadata) lan-
guages, although it would be possible to translate all of the 
documents into the query language. Although many experi-
ments have been carried out using query translation tech-
niques, in the real world they pose a number of problems re-
lated to the need of contextualisation and interpretation, 
which are increased when dealing with legal information.

Multilingual access is based on the recognition that cul-
tural diversity is vital to the maintenance of society and that 
languages are a strong element of the different cultural tradi-
tions. With the increasing moves towards an integrated 
world and the multicultural nature of modern society and its 
globalisation, which is facilitated by the development of 
digital information and telecommunications networks, the 
need for multilingual information access has become more 
and more pressing and the issues connected with cross-
language retrieval have increased in importance.  
While nowadays large scale digital collections contribute 
to the dismantling of the geographic barriers to information 
access, language barriers are still critical to the effectiveness 
of resource sharing and world-wide common access, and 
their emergence as a problem is to be connected with the  
growing number of information databases now available on 
networks.
9
  
It is mainly in the late 1970s that careful attention has been 
paid to cross-language retrieval and related tools. Software 
solutions have been developed and research projects and 
studies are under way where this functionality is often asso-
ciated with disciplines like artificial intelligence and compu-
tational linguistics,
10
 machine translation
11
 and language en-
gineering, natural language processing.
12
 
An important aspect of multilingual access concerns stra-
tegic and management issues. These refer to the need for 
general consensus and recommendations to achieve multilin-
gual functionality. Emphasis is put on the need for a para-
digm shift in the information professionals’ community to 
overcome language barriers in information retrieval. These 
themes are not as popular in the literature as those concern-
ing technical and functional aspects, but are specifically ad-
dressed by some authors
13
 who point out that the problem of 
English language dominance, initially encountered in the de-
velopment of the character encoding systems, affects devel-
opments in cross-language information retrieval and that at-

tention should expand beyond technical aspects.  
It is also claimed
14
 that, despite the technological develop-
ments which have occurred in the 1990s, in general digital li-
brary research and development have until recently some-
how neglected the issues of multilingual querying, presenta-
tion and retrieval. Although this has changed in the recent 
years and progress have been made, no optimal solution is 
available yet.  
There are two sides to the problem of multilingual access, 
which are of a technical and linguistic nature. These two as-
pects are very rarely dealt with in parallel in the literature. 
Issues concerning the presentation of results following a 
search session, the standard encoding of characters and the 
development of multilingual thesauri for subject headings, 
generally appear in strictly library related literature, while 
topics such as matching queries and documents, query ex-
pansion techniques and ranking methods are discussed in 
wider information specialists’ environments. 
The technical multilingual challenge is very complex. In 
the actual digital library environment where primary elec-
tronic resources are to be accessed, this implies interopera-
bility of character sets used to represent texts in different 
languages.
15
  
Concern is expressed for the issues related to both multi-
linguality and multiscripts
16
 as there are thousands of lan-
guages, and only about two dozen scripts are currently used; 
however users expect them to be properly handled, and li-
brarians and information specialists must meet their custom-
ers’ requirements by asking systems’ suppliers to respond to 
such expectations. 
Furthermore, in order to realise the “global village li-
brary”, access, display and storage devices have to be devel-
oped and improved to accommodate multilingual and mul-
tiscript information, but installation of communication sys-
tems are also needed to allow the transmission of different 
characters. These fall within the competence of the technical 
industry, which must be carefully advised by the informa-
tion professionals’ community. 
In addressing issues of cross-language retrieval in a digital 
library environment, multilingual recognition and represen-
tation are commonly considered as essential features and in 
particular it is claimed how a major requirement of multilin-
gual applications is the support of character sets and stan-
dard encoding to represent the information to be manipu-
lated. It is also specified how HTTP protocol for the transfer 
of Web documents and resources provide parameters for 
language identification and how multilinguality is also taken

into account in HTML documents where a tag for the 
LANG attribute specifies the language of each HTML ele-
ment. However the richness of characters, which have now 
reached a standard encoding system allowing a unique code 
(The Unicode Consortium, 2003) for each character of most 
of the world's written languages (about 64000 characters), 
can be displayed only if local applications are equipped with 
appropriate fonts and if base facilities in place for multilin-
gual applications running on the World Wide Web are used, 
such as, for example, mark up of bi-directional text, super-
scripts and subscripts. 
As cross-language information retrieval addresses the 
growing need to access large volumes of data and complex 
objects across language boundaries. There is consensus on 
identifying multilingual functionality not only as a multilin-
gual interface dialogue, but as the ability for users to search 
in their preferred language and retrieve documents written 
or indexed in other languages.
17
 
The complexity of languages as such and of languages 
coming into contact with one another, that is translation is-
sues, is intimately linked to multilingual access’ functional-
ity. Gaining correspondence between languages is a major 
problem both when controlled and uncontrolled vocabular-
ies are used. Vocabulary mapping, that is establishing 
equivalencies between terms, is a complex task due to diffi-
culties arising from the use of different linguistic expressions 
for the same concept, the different degree of specificity and 
the presence of polysemeous terms.  
In cross-language retrieval, methods have to be developed 
which successfully match queries against information objects 
over languages. While in monolingual retrieval some kind of 
word matching and weighting of results is the traditional 
way to do this, with cross-language retrieval this matching is 
much more complex to achieve. This implies the use of 
mechanisms for translating queries or documents and for 
disambiguating sense, which is an already crucial issue in a 
monolingual environment, but is considerably increased 
when mapping over languages.  
3. Key aspects of cross-language legal information re-
trieval 
While much attention has been given over the past years to 
the study and development of methodologies for accessing 
multilingual information in general, limited research and 
systems have been produced in the specific area of legal in-
formation retrieval and of related cross-language indexing 
and searching tools. It is worth noting that major attention 
has been paid by scholars and legal experts to linguistic and 
conceptual aspects of legal languages: these themes are un-
doubtedly relevant to multilingual access and can provide 
important insights into the subject of cross-language re-
trieval of legal information.

1994, pp. 29-44, ISBN 3598217978. 
The difficult task to effectively access multilingual legal 
material through information retrieval systems is definitively 
to match legal terms across languages and find adequate cor-
respondence beyond legal system diversity, in a word to ac-
commodate diversity in language and culture.
18
 This gener-
ally implies translating from the language of the query to 
that of the material to be found or vice versa. 
Most projects and system implementations are confined to 
making legislative and jurisprudential information available 
at national level; however in the last few years there has been 
a wide production of digital legal repositories which have 
been made available on the Internet in a variety of languages, 
and the need for accessing such wealth of information by a 
wide variety of users all over the world has rapidly in-
creased. 
As written below, the following aspects seem worthy of 
analysis as being closely related to the development and ef-
fectiveness of legal information retrieval systems: a) the rela-
tionship between law and language; b) comparative research 
of legal systems in relation to language issues. 
3.1. The relation between law and language 
It has been emphasized that “the law is a profession of 
words”.
19
 Many of the problems about meanings that are of 
concern to language specialists turn out to be of interest for 
legal professionals as well, and to impact on the exchange 
and retrieval of legal information. In fact, information re-
trieval systems are based on language as queries are matched 
with the documents to be searched (be them free-text or 
metadata) through terms.  
The relationship between language and law has since long 
attracted the interest of both jurists and linguistics. It is still 
a big source of worry and concern in our modern society 
where the interrelation between different legal orders is 
common. Both, comparative jurists operating in academic 
environments and legal professionals are more and more 
faced with issues and cases where disparate legal models and 
concepts are circulated. As these are expressed in different 
languages, the problem arises to cope with these languages, 
with the practical implications of multilingualism, as well as 
with its theoretical principles.  
Like language, law has, in its origin, development and 
structure, a character which is intimately linked to the his-
tory and culture of each country. A number of linguists and 
historians of the law have compared law and languages from 
the point of view of their origins as well as of their patterns 
of evolution and have pointed out that both law and lan-
guage have, at their essence, rules which are constitutive to a 
system.

Moreover, there is a functional relationship between lan-
guage and law as knowledge of law requires language and ju-
rists have greatly contributed to the elaboration of legal lan-
guages for better adapting them to the needs of law within 
the various countries and their related communities.  
In this context the transfer of legal knowledge is entrusted 
to written or spoken language. This leads to state that the 
law cannot manifest itself without language.
21
 
As language is essentially a communication tool, it is suc-
cessful when synchronization between the parties occurs. 
But while language is a means of understanding, it is also a 
means of misunderstanding between people belonging to 
different social groups or cultures. This synchronization is 
more than ever fundamental in the language of law
22
 where 
equivalence of meanings across legal systems are difficult to 
find and assess, even when the same language is used! 
In fact, legal language consists of legal terms, phrases and 
stable conventions and as such reflects one particular legal 
system, but in principle the multiple languages of law are not 
simply the national languages which transmit the contents of 
one or more law or systems, but also the languages which 
are proper to each category of people, who although speak-
ing the same language, are bound to their own use of legal 
terminology and related concepts.. The system-specificity of 
legal terms makes a relevant number of legal scholars and 
professionals state that the language of the law is to be learnt 
and communicated in its close relationship with a given cul-
ture, the related country and people’s history and heritage, 
conceived as a socially acquired pool of knowledge which 
represents its richness and uniqueness.
23
 As legal language is 
culture-bound and interrelated with one particular society 
and its legal system, it is seen as the collective memory of the 
legal actors belonging to a given legal system.  
While the dependency of legal concepts of a particular le-
gal system is the key characteristic of legal language as a sys-
tem of symbols, such concepts are in fact not forever fixed 
and unchangeable, as they change when legal experience 
changes.24 The change of legal concepts is brought about 
through legal argumentation.
25
 This is evidenced in the mul-
tifaceted role of language in establishing, maintaining, and 
changing concepts, which makes cross-system interoperabil-
ity even harder to achieve.

A further argumentation is based on the branch of linguis-
tics known as ‘linguistic relativity’ focusing on the fact that 
what one language system conceptualizes in one way is not 
conceptualised in the same way in all other language sys-
tems. This is especially true for legal terminologies at a sys-
tem level.
27
 
As mentioned above, legal language, like language in gen-
eral, can be viewed both as a system of conventional symbols 
and as a means of communication for people belonging to a 
particular social group or culture. When it is viewed as dis-
course, the focus is on its function as a means of communi-
cation. Discourse is defined as language used in social prac-
tice, communicative practice in a particular social group,
28
 so 
discourse is dependent on the social context in which it is 
used; in other words it is shaped by that context, which is 
not an immutable entity.  
In this view, legal discourse consists of legal rules pro-
duced within the framework of a legal system, with the dou-
ble function of sustaining and reproducing the system and of 
changing and transforming it. All this has implications on 
the possibilities of a legal communication and, since these 
changes are brought about in legal discourse, it is possible to 
come up with a convergence of the national legal systems 
and their languages. In addition, today legal discourse is no 
longer confined to the individual national legal systems, but 
transcends national boundaries.  
This brings some doctrine to state that different legal prac-
tices, diverse legal languages and cultures are exposed to each 
other and it is likely that, for example in Europe, the na-
tional legal traditions will gradually change along with the 
emerging intercultural communication of legal actors, who 
in that way adapt themselves to the changing institutional 
context of law.
29
  
From another perspective, similar conclusions have been 
drawn
30
 based on the assumption that reason, as the univer-
sal human faculty of intuition by which one sees reality, is 
the common language of people belonging to different 
speech communities, but the fact that our experience of the 
world is bound to language, does not imply an exclusiveness 
of perspectives. An example clarifies this concept: even if the 
French legal concept of “contrat” is radically different from 
the English concept of “contract”, due to opposite ap-
proaches to the formation of a contract, an English lawyer 
can understand the French concept and vice versa.  
However coming to an understanding across legal lan-
guages and legal systems is a hard process and the establish-
ment of a common understanding can only be achieved if the

actors base their interpretation on the tacit suppositions 
about the world which forms the point of departure of the 
communicative action.  
Incorporating these requirements in cross-language infor-
mation systems requires interpretation and adaptation 
strategies over languages and systems, which is hard to ac-
complish without a high expertise in linguistics and com-
parative law.    
3.2. Comparative aspects 
The problems raised by multilingualism are strictly con-
nected with those related to the variety and diversity of legal 
systems and as such to comparative law. Far from the opin-
ion that pursuing comparisons may be limited to descriptive 
translations or summaries of foreign law, a number of com-
paratists
31
 express their doubts about the possibility of a real 
comparison of legal systems. This does not mean ignoring 
that comparative research has reached very good results in 
putting scholars and legal professionals to work together in 
comparative projects, launching harmonization activities 
and, at European level, having codes drafted as well as direc-
tives to be fitted with the legal concepts and structure of the 
Member States. 
Retrieval systems to legal information across different legal 
systems represent a practical approach to the confrontation 
and exchange of legal cultures; since comparison involves 
observation and explanation of similarities and differences, 
comparative research can give a major contribution to the 
development of these information systems. In fact, the im-
plementation of retrieval functionalities implies taking into 
account and properly managing the peculiarities of legal 
concepts across systems, handling the variety of languages 
used to express these various concepts and addressing the 
terminological issues of representing the various legal cul-
tures. 
A glance to worldwide legal orders shows that several 
countries have for a long time operated in a multi-system 
and multilingual environment: Canada, Switzerland, Bel-
gium, Spain are only some examples of this, not to mention 
the case of Europe, with its 27 countries participating in the 
European Union, with their respective systems, languages 
and families of law. Their experience reveals that this plural-
ism is managed using different methods and practices, based 
on translation, interpretation, adaptations of legal terms, and 
in a number of cases on multi-language drafting. 
Multilingualism and comparison among systems are often 
addressed as a joint main issue in cooperative efforts pro-
moting harmonization activities for the creation of uniform 
law in various areas (at European level efforts have mainly 
been made in contract, private and trade law as well as intel-

lectual property law). It is a matter of fact that the direct im-
plications of comparing and possibly integrating different le-
gal concepts and structures are intimately linked to language 
issues.  
Many comparatists are strongly concerned about the im-
plications of the differences existing between the cultural 
contexts underlying the various legal languages and about 
the difficulties in transferring legal meanings and legal con-
cepts from one legal system to another, even when the same 
language is used. A number of frequently mentioned exam-
ples are made to refer to this phenomenon, such as societé in 
French legal language in France, which has not the same 
meaning as societé in French legal language in Belgium.
32
 
Similarly, Besitz means factual possession for a German. 
However, an Austrian lawyer understands Besitz as the fac-
tual possession including the animus domini, that is Inne-
habung. So even German speaking lawyers from Austria, 
Germany, Liechtenstein and Switzerland will not under-
stand automatically each other’s concept-based legal termi-
nology.
33
 
In recent years research studies have increasingly concen-
trated on the relationship between legal language and com-
parative analysis of different legal orders. This topic, mainly 
debated in conferences, is often tackled from the point of 
view of the validity and performance of legal translation and 
of the analogy between legal translation and legal interpreta-
tion. In this direction many are the initiatives aimed at laying 
the foundation for a common frame of reference and at pro-
moting, for example at European level, a pan-European ter-
minology.
34
  
In addressing the issues related to the development of sys-
tems and tools for accessing legal information across legal 
systems, consideration is to be given to the methods em-
ployed in the comparative process of legal systems: integra-
tive as opposed to contrastive.
35
 
A brief historical outline is given of the two approaches 
with special reference to Europe, as such approaches are 
likely to influence the cross-system retrieval techniques 
adopted in the implementation of retrieval systems.  
In continental Europe for a number of centuries a ius com-
mune emerged which did not mean an entirely uniform law, 
but certainly a set of shared formative elements of the law, 
which are called by Sacco “legal formants”.
36
 With the age of 
codification, two facts contributed to the creation of intel-
lectual barriers between the legal systems of the several na-

tions: the abandonment of Latin and the adoption of na-
tional codes in each country’s national language. This intro-
duced a contrastive approach in the practice of comparative 
law, and law professionals treated the national systems as 
real foreign law. It is only under the actual influence of 
trans-national exchange and increasing cross-border transac-
tions in every sector of life, that a common core of legal sys-
tems has started to be searched and an integrative compari-
son has newly emerged among legal scholars.  
The actual debate among comparative scholars is extremely 
rich and complex. It is claimed that original innovation in 
law is very small and borrowing and imitation is of central 
importance in understanding the course of legal change. But 
the focus is also on divergences in the peculiarities of com-
mon and civil law systems, namely in their formants37, sys-
tem’s principles and rules, manner of reasoning of lawyers 
and use of authorities guiding them in legal questions. How-
ever the possibility for fruitful convergence and mutual un-
derstanding is envisaged and encouraged.  
Reciprocal influences, even though not necessarily direct 
legal transplants, are likely to happen and the point is made 
that in the first decades of the twentieth century the differ-
ences between common law and civil law traditions were 
emphasised, whereas today, at least in a number of fields of 
law, the common elements are sought rather than differences 
stressed.
38
 
The convergence or divergence approaches mentioned 
above are key elements for implementing multilingual re-
trieval tools and services: according to the chosen approach, 
the methods followed in these systems will facilitate terms 
and concepts to be matched across legal systems, adapting 
concepts of different systems and helping contextualisation 
so to approach the most likely similar concept in the target 
language and system. In a more restrictive approach, only 
broad correspondences will be established focused on broad 
concepts which are likely to be commonly understood by a 
variety of users. 
4. Conclusions 
Multilingualism is a phenomenon which greatly affects the 
efficiency of exchange of information among people in every 
sector of life. Cross-language retrieval systems are tools 
which contribute to such exchange, supporting research and 
world-wide communication, and helping data to be searched 
irrespective of the language in which information objects are 
expressed. 
However, systems developed so far mainly concentrate on 
pairs rather than on multiple languages, the latter being a 
much more complex endeavour. In the recent years a num-
ber of experiments and discussions focused on the develop-
ments of vocabulary matching over languages as such, but 
cross-language retrieval is still in the experimental stage and 
we cannot talk about truly multilingual retrieval systems. 
                                                          
37
  Sacco, Rodolfo, Legal Formants, in: American Journal of Comparative 
Law, 1991, pp. 1 ss. (I); pp. 344 ss. (II). 
Any single method presents some limitations and there ex-
ists no one-fits-all solution for ensuring that users effectively 
access information beyond language barriers. 
In particular, in the law domain, interoperability is para-
mount. Here a vast category of users need to exchange legal 
information world-wide and carry out activities in a context 
where it is possible to reach a common understanding of law 
beyond language barriers. However, this requirement is hard 
to meet, due to the variety of languages and modes in which 
the legal discourse is expressed and due to the diversity of 
legal orders and the legal concepts on which these systems 
are founded.  
It is a fact that research is still under way to build a strong 
basis for monolingual information access, and cross-
language retrieval will definitely be based on advances in this 
area. In the specific field of legal domain, adequate tech-
niques for disambiguation of terms, translation strategies 
taking into account pragmatic and cultural interpretations 
and, mostly important, multilingual ontologies, appear to be 
a very promising approach. Relevant activities are carried 
out in this direction for the development of legal ontologies. 
One example is a multilingual legal thesaurus called “Lexical 
Ontologies for Legal Information Sharing – LOIS project”,
39
 
which aim is to develop a multilingual access facility for 
European legal databases. This will enable citizens and pro-
fessional users to search for European legislation and other 
legal documents (such as court cases) across, at the moment, 
six European languages (Italian, English, German, Czech, 
Portuguese and Dutch). To achieve this goal the project will 
use formal representations of legal concepts in each language 
using the WordNet technique.
40
 Similar concepts in different 
languages (synsets) will be cross linked in such a way that 
users can enter queries to a legal documentation base in 
his/her language and retrieve also documents written in dif-
ferent languages. 
All this implies a labour-intensive work as the model of le-
gal multilingualism is not simply to be confined to the trans-
position of legal concepts from one system to another, but it 
is likely to require a cooperative venture, an orchestration 
process involving all stakeholders responsible for the various 
legal systems as legislators, judges, legal professionals and 
eventually citizens in an effort towards a common under-
standing of law beyond language and system barriers.

 The technical solution that will be adopted in the LOIS project is the 
Princeton WordNet initiative. WordNet is a multi-lingual index that 
specifies lexical semantic concepts and relations across languages. As 
such, it can be seen as a formally specified ontology that can be used 
for various applications in automated text processing (e.g. correction, 
explanation and translation). The importance of this technique for the 
multilingual European context has already been recognized by the EU, 
which has funded a generic implementation project: EuroWordNet,
