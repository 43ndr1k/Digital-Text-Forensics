Abstract. One of the problems in testing the proficiency of Estonian as a first or second 
language is that high-stake exams are assessed against the standards of the written 
language. Given this, we set out to describe the features of the actual use of educated 
language in different types of text. The goal was to develop L1 and L2 teaching and testing 
through models of educated language use which a language learner can approach step by 
step. To achieve this goal we compared the following features of educated use of Estonian 
as L1 and L2 in different situations: (1) lexical richness and vocabulary range; (2) con-
textuality and formality of the text; (3) syntactic complicacy; (4) temporal characteristics 
of the dialogue; (5) strength and disruptiveness of the foreign accent; (6) sentence 
intonation. The results show that educated language use is mainly genre-dependent. This 
moves the focus of language learning onto texts of specific genres and confirms the 
suitability of an action-based approach centred on genres in L1 and L2 teaching and 
testing, and the need for regular assessor training.

1. Introduction 
 
In Europe, the standard set of levels of language proficiency (CEFR) has been 
widely accepted as a common standard to help linguistic communities establish 
within and between themselves (a) language learning objectives for learners 
needing to manage in typical work, social, personal, or educational situations (the 
action-oriented approach), and (b) proficiency exams to measure how learners 
cope with these situations. 
As test takers’ chances of getting a job in future or continuing their studies 
depend on the results of any official exam (so-called high-stakes exams), language 
Natural speaking 121 
testing should ideally be balanced and fair. At the same time, because there are no 
benchmarks to measure how native speakers cope with the situations as compared 
to the L2-speakers of the language1, it is easy for the assessors to give too much 
credit to standard (i.e. normative) language use or to features of speaking or 
writing that are considered to be correct in school-grammar, but never measured to 
be characteristic of modern natural speech. Our goal is to measure some para-
meters of real-life use of the educated Estonian language in order to put these 
aspects in the right proportion. As some features of L2 use may be irrelevant in 
managing particular situations, and should not be taken into account in testing 
under the action-oriented approach, we also collected L2 data and compared it to 
L1 data. 
Until the autumn of 2008, Estonian language proficiency was tested nationally 
on three levels. After this date the proficiency exams of the Council of Europe 
were adopted (Table 1). To harmonise national and CE language exams, new 
guidelines for assessing writing and speaking skills were needed. 
This article looks at the speaking proficiency of the proficient or effective user, 
the level where all essential language skills and competences can be tested (see 
CEFR, or in Estonian, Kerge 2008).

Speaking involves two essential skills: oral interaction (dialogue) and oral pre-
sentation (monologue). Both skills were tested in high-level language proficiency 
exams until 2008, and are now tested in C1-level exams. In this study we look at 
both monologues and dialogues. We believe that the test taker’s performance 
should not be compared to the standard or officially correct usage, sometimes 
unattainable even for a native L1 linguist, but to natural usage, which focuses on 
the message, undisturbed by the sound of speaking or the choice, form, order and 
binding of lexical units (see also Ratcliff et al. 2002).  
We take natural language to mean the language that is usually spoken and 
written by a university-educated non-linguist. The language use of such a person 
can be considered the reference model of natural language. Our research task is to 
establish which aspects are important in defining natural speech, and which 
aspects should be taken into account when assessing speaking skills at a C1-level 
exam. (Our research questions are presented below under the parameters studied). 
Depending on the text type (monologue or dialogue)2, we will look at the follow-
ing aspects: (1) lexical richness (the Uber index of the balance of words and tokens) 
and vocabulary range (proportion of basic vs. rare words); (2) contextuality and 
formality (F-index relating context-free vs. context-bound vocabulary, inversely 
proportional to text ambiguity); (3) complicacy of syntax (sentence length and 
complexity, plus degree of nominalisation); (4) temporal characteristics of the 
dialogue (culture-specific length of turn, pausing, simultaneous talking); (5) strength 
and disruptiveness of the L2 foreign accent (relationship between the perceived 
strength and disruptiveness); (6) aspects of L2 intonation (patterns of rising 
intonation). 
In order to establish a foundation for the L2 proficiency assessment, we will 
compare L1 and L2 dialogues and monologues produced at language exams, and 
present comparative data on spontaneous Estonian speech in dialogues. We will 
describe some features of language use by looking at both oral text types and 
written text data. However, as can be seen below, some features lack earlier data 
that would allow comparisons to be made. 
 
 
2. Materials and method 
 
The text material for this study was collected in a standardised situation in 
2006: for non-natives at the Estonian High Proficiency exams, and for natives in 
an exam-like situation (same examiner, same time-limit, same task). 
There were three tasks: writing an essay (subjective discussion expressing 
opinions, 250 words, 60 minutes); speaking with another test taker (oral dialogue 
in the style of a negotiation, 5–7 minutes, see example in Figure 1); and giving a 
1–2-minute presentation (oral monologue, see example in Figure 2). The dis-
cussion topics were linked by two keywords: environment and society. 
                                                     
2  In this article, a distinction is made between the terms text type (oral or written monologue or 
dialogue) and genre (linguistic expression of register as a contextual semantic configuration).

REAL ESTATE SHARKS VERSUS RESIDENTS 
In Estonian urban planning the business interests of real estate developers are often 
considered above those of the citizens. 
Have a conversation and make a joint decision about:  
• What the main faults of the Estonian urban environment are, and 
• What the city-dwellers could do to improve their own environment

   houses? 
2. What are the main shortcomings of Estonia’s modern urban environment? 
3. How and how much should the state support less successful citizens? 
 
Figure 2. Presentation topics. Candidates were asked to choose one topic and give a short 
presentation after one minute of preparation. 
 
 
Although we recorded 24 exam candidates at the high proficiency exam, we 
chose only eight recordings for in-depth analysis. These eight candidates got the 
maximum or a near-maximum score for their speaking skills and their total scores 
were sufficient for them to receive a high proficiency certificate. 
The subjects formed two groups that were comparable in terms of language 
proficiency requirements3: 8 native Estonian speakers and 8 native Russian 
speakers (four women and four men in each group), all fluent in spoken and 
written Estonian. 
The recordings were carried out using a digital recorder (sampling frequency 
44.1 kHz, 16 bit, mono) and a high-quality microphone at a distance of about one 
metre from the candidates. 
The oral data was analysed with the speech analysis software PRAAT (Boersma 
and Weenink 2006) and Sony Sound Forge 9.0, and transcribed syntactically and 
morphologically. WordSmith Tools 3.0 was used to differentiate between words (i.e. 
different words, or types) and tokens (word forms) (Scott 1996). Morphological 
Analyser 3.3 (freeware available from http://www.eki.ee/tarkvara/analyys) was used 
for parts of speech. 
                                                     
3  Due to the official language requirements in public service, public health, and legal affairs, 
Estonian language skills were tested at three levels until 2008 and are now tested at four levels. 
Command of the official language at the highest level (C1) is mostly obligatory for jobs requiring 
higher education (heads of public institutions, civil servants, lawyers, doctors, teachers of 
Estonian or students whose language of tuition is Estonian, military officers, etc.).

3. Analysis and results 
 
3.1. Lexical richness and vocabulary range 
In proficiency testing, vocabulary is mainly viewed in the context of productive 
skills such as speaking and writing (see Dewaele and Pavlenko 2003). CEFR 
(2001: 112) presumes that a C1-level language user “Has a good command of a 
broad lexical repertoire allowing gaps to be readily overcome with circumlocu-
tions; little obvious searching for expressions or avoidance strategies. Good 
command of idiomatic expressions and colloquialisms.” 
Both vocabulary use and range are markers of linguistic competence and fluent 
speech (Little 2005, Read and Chapelle 2001). By subjective assessment it is 
possible to assess fluency. However, assessing vocabulary range and lexical rich-
ness by assessing how well each topic is covered in terms of vocabulary is an 
extremely complicated task, especially for spoken language. 
The question also arises whether it is necessary to deal with these aspects of L2 
vocabulary separately when assessing fluency, communicativeness and adequacy 
of language use in C1-level exams. 
We aim to describe lexical richness and vocabulary range as markers of natural 
speech and consider the importance of these criteria in the subjective assessment 
of L2 skills. Our research questions are: 
• How rich is the vocabulary of educated L1 and L2 users? 
• How can the vocabulary range of educated L1 and L2 users be described 
given the average frequency of words in Estonian? 
• Do lexical richness and vocabulary range vary in different forms of 
language use and text types (spoken dialogue and monologue, written essay 
as a monologue)? 
Lexical richness can be assessed by looking at the number of different words 
in text. For this we used the Uber index: U = (logN)2/(logN – logV), where N is the 
total number of word forms (tokens) and V is the number of different words 
(types)4. This formula is an algebraic transformation of the TTR (type/token ratio), 
which reduces somewhat the influence of text length on lexical richness assess-
ment, and is suitable for short texts (see Jarvis 2002, Vermeer 2000: 76–79). 
We measured lexical richness separately in all the text types under study: oral 
presentation (monologue), conversation (dialogue) and, as a comparison, written 
essay (see Table 2 and Figure 3). 
 
                                                     
4  Only correctly used words were counted as words (i.e. words used in inappropriate contexts or in 
a way that would impair understanding were excluded). For example we excluded the word 
pulpulistlik as a non-word or strongly deformed version of populistlik [populistic], and some 
completely incomprehensible sound combinations.

The results show that text types hold different levels of lexical richness. There 
is a natural increase in lexical richness from dialogue to monologue and from oral 
production to written production. 
In oral texts L1 vocabulary is richer than L2 vocabulary, but as this has not 
stopped the assessors from giving high scores for speaking skills to our candidates, 
we conclude that listeners are not disturbed by the poorer L2 vocabulary. 
The assessment of vocabulary range usually relies on the belief that more 
frequent words are better known than rarer words (see Laufer 2005). 
We compared words from L1 and L2 dialogues and monologues with the 
10,000 most frequently used words in public texts in Estonian (Kaalep and 
Muischnek 2002), as shown in Figure 4. 
The share of elementary vocabulary (the 3,000 most frequently used words) 
was remarkably high in all text types in both L1 and L2. Rarer words (not included 
in the frequency dictionary) accounted for less than a quarter of the vocabulary use 
and could be used by researchers to study candidates’ language strategies.

Proper nouns (proper names) account for about 8% of rare words in L1 oral 
speech and 3.5% in L1 written texts. L2 contains 3–4 times more proper nouns in 
all text types except oral monologue: 20% in oral dialogue and 13% in written 
text. The great number of proper nouns in L2 conversation points to a cultural and 
social awareness and to a wish to demonstrate it. At the same time, the rare 
vocabulary of all texts contains relatively few numbers and numerals: less than 1% 
in all oral texts, 2% in L1 written texts and 3.5% in L2 written texts. 
Rare vocabulary is mostly thematic vocabulary, principally nouns. Here, nouns 
make up about 57% of L1 speech and about 63% of written texts. L2 oral 
monologue is similar to L1. However, nouns make up only around 42% of rare 
words of L2 dialogue and around 59% of the L2 essay. When we compare the rare 
thematic vocabulary of L1 and L2, the latter is considerably smaller in dialogue (a 
difference of 15.5%), the only spontaneous genre in our study. This shows the 
inability of L2 users to activate rare words as quickly as needed, although 
spontaneous text is also less demanding. 
Strikingly, foreign stems are much more numerous in L2 monologues, with 
17% and 28% in the oral presentation and essay respectively in L2 compared to 
3.5% and 8% in L1. In dialogue this tendency is reversed, with foreign words 
accounting for 8.5% of L1 and 2% of L2. 
L2 users are also more modest in word formation, something which comes very 
naturally to native speakers. While compounds and regular formations make up 
50–60% of L1 speech and as much as 75% of written text rare words, in L2 they 
make up 35–40% of speech and less than 50% of written text rare vocabulary. 
Natural speaking 127 
This material allows us to draw some preliminary conclusions. First, familiarity 
with foreign stems has been seen as an important support for language learners in 
the early stages of language acquisition. However, in more demanding contexts the 
use of foreign stems also increases the freedom and precision of expression at high 
levels of L2 proficiency. Second, word formation has an important role in natural 
Estonian syntactic operations. However, given the Indo-European language 
background of the L2 users, they may never practice word formation to the same 
extent as L1 users do (see also Syntactic Complicacy below). 
Although both spoken and written texts mostly contain elementary vocabulary, 
the choice of words differs in monologue and dialogue (see Figures 5–10). It is 
worth noticing that despite their more limited vocabulary, L2 users choose words 
very similar to those chosen by L1 users: the biggest vocabulary overlap occurs in 
oral language use, both dialogue and monologue, and the overlap is smallest in the 
written essay and the dialogue. 
The overlapping words remain within the 1,000 most frequently used words. 
We can conclude that natural language is characterised by lexical richness 
dependent on text type and higher-level language users can choose appropriate 
words from their vocabulary for each text type.

Given these results, it would be wrong to assess C1-level vocabulary range in 
the context of speaking skills. The vocabulary range and richness of C1-level 
language users should be assessed instead by testing their receptive skills. 
 
3.2. Contextuality and formality of the text 
A difference in the balance of parts of speech in oral and written production has 
been noticed for quite a long time and by many researchers (for an overview since 
the early 1930s see Chafe and Tannen 1987), and Heylighen and Dewaele based 
the theory of the contextuality–formality continuum on this balance. Their hypo-
thesis states that nouns and other parts of speech (articles, prepositions, adjectives) 
bound to them make texts more exact and thus more formal, while more 
contextual words have the opposite effect. Based on this balance, a formula called 
the F-index was worked out to index the level of formality of a text (Heylighen 
and Dewaele 2002). 
We measured the contextuality-formality of our texts, after adapting Heylighen 
and Dewaele’s (2002) formula5 to the Estonian language, which has no articles, 
very few prepositions and numerous postpositions: 
F = 0.5*[(noun frequency + adjective freq. + adposition freq.) 
 – (pronoun freq.+ verb freq.+ adverb freq.+interjection freq.) + 100] 
The formula is based on the assumption that the frequency of such parts of 
speech as pronouns, verbs, adverbs and interjections makes the text more con-
textual and thus more ambiguous, while the frequency of others such as nouns, 
adjectives, adpositions and articles decreases contextuality, making the text less 
ambiguous and more formal (see Figure 11).  
We asked whether F differs significantly in different text types and genres and, 
if so, whether this feature helps in distinguishing between L1 and L2 texts. 
We determined parts of speech in L1 and L2 dialogues, monologues and essays 
using certain rules of our own, for example we excluded conjunctions and 
numerals from the formula, although we did count conjunctions to determine the

5  According to the authors of the formula their research shows that it works equally reliably for a 
text consisting of a few hundred words and for longer texts that they have studied or interpreted 
(Heylighen and Dewaele 2002: 321).

total number of words. We mostly divided numerals into adjectives (ordinals) and 
nouns (cardinals), by looking at contextual use, so words like first and second 
were marked either as pronouns or adjectives, depending on the contextual 
meaning. To measure contextuality precisely, we counted all cases of pro-form use 
(pronouns, pronumerals, proadverbs) and other contextually defined references 
such as afore, certain or given. As the candidates used only well-known proper 
nouns like Russia, these were also counted as nouns. 
The results are shown in Table 3 and Figure 12. 
We can see that contextuality-formality in L1 and L2 use is similar across all 
text types, as any difference of less than three is not statistically significant 
(Heylighen and Dewaele 2002: 328). With both L1 and L2 the formality of

communication increases from oral speech to written text and from dialogue to 
monologue. The distribution of parts of speech by text type is also similar in L1 
and L2. 
Such similarity between L1 and L2 use in the degree of formality of different 
text types has convinced us that in testing C1-level proficiency, the most important 
skill to test is the ability of candidates to use language appropriate to a specific 
genre and register. This includes their ability to choose words, expressions and 
collocations from their elementary and relatively poor vocabulary that are 
appropriate to a specific genre and register, as seen in the results in part 3.1, which 
also referred to differences in the choice of words depending on the text-type. If 
the degree of formality is suitable for the text type, differences between other 
aspects of L1 and L2 use go unnoticed. The high scores given to our candidates for 
their speaking skills also confirm this. 
 
3.3. Syntactic complicacy 
Syntactic features such as typological features of word order, phrase ordering, 
etc vary between languages. According to Stamatatos et al. (2000), the syntax of 
functional styles also tends to differ in its parameters, as has been noted in many 
comparable corpus studies. 
For Estonian, the only descriptions have been of the syntactic complicacy of 
written texts in various fields of language use, and three parameters have been 
used, each of which covers many features. These parameters are sentence length, 
which looks at the number of tokens; sentence complexity, which measures the 
total number of punctuation marks and conjunctions without punctuation; and the 
level of abstractness of a text, derived from the percentage of regular deverbal 
nouns complicating the text, while nominalised phrases are more abstract than 
verbal ones (see Kerge 2003). 
We asked whether oral texts differ in their characteristics here. 
As there is no clear research evidence of the same kind of sentence complexity 
in oral speech, syntactic complicacy can be measured only by sentence-length and 
level of abstractness (see Table 4). 
The oral data given in Table 4 can be compared to earlier written data (Kerge, 
op. cit.) only in mean values because the latter does not operate with medians. 
Earlier measures from analysis of e-mail correspondence between colleagues and 
similar sources show sentences to be about 9.2 tokens long (the mean for modern 
Estonian text-types is 14) and the level of text abstractness to be about 0.9 (the 
mean is 3.4). This means that in any oral language use, sentences tend to be 
longer, and – being less nominalised – also much less abstract than in writing. 
The median values in Table 4 show that the longest sentences – equally long in 
L1 and L2 – appear in oral monologue. Sentences in L2 dialogue are longer than 
those of native speakers; the only difference in oral monologue is the maximum 
value of sentence length in L2. In the essay genre, the values are reversed, and on 
average L1 sentences are longer. When L2 is used in writing, there is a clear 
tendency to use shorter sentences,  probably in order to avoid mistakes.  The  same

seems to apply to nominalisation, the percentage of which in L2 is always lower 
than in L1 where the highest value of nominalisation appears in writing (L1 2.8%; 
L2 only half of the L1 value). This shows again the tendency identified in the 
context of rare words, that word formation in L2 is not easy to learn and the skill 
also needs to be polished at higher levels of language learning. On the other hand, 
it may not be very relevant in testing oral, or even writing skills, as there are other 
syntactic possibilities for conveying the same content, such as subordinate clause 
or other types of non-finite verb phrases not studied here. 
 
3.4. Temporal characteristics of dialogue 
According to CEFR 2001 (p 86), an important skill in discourse is turn-taking. 
A high-level language user, from B2 level upwards, “can initiate, maintain and 
end discourse appropriately with effective turn-taking. Can initiate discourse, take 
his/her turn when appropriate and end conversation when he/she needs to, though 
he/she may not always do this elegantly.” 
The length of turn, pauses in speech, simultaneous speaking, etc. are greatly 
culture-dependent (see ten Bosch et al. 2005). In spontaneous Estonian dialogue, 
turns and pauses between them are short, and simultaneous speaking is often used 
to give feedback and take turns (Pajupuu 1995).  
In the dialogues under study we were interested in the following questions: 
 
                                                     
6  In oral spontaneous speech, sentence length was determined by looking at the movement of the 
fundamental frequency, pauses and content of the text. 
Hille Pajupuu, Krista Kerge, Lya Meister, Eva Liina Asu and Pilvi Alp 132
• How can educated L1 dialogue be described in terms of its temporal cha-
racteristics? 
• Are the temporal characteristics of L1 and L2 similar? 
In order to get answers, we measured the durations of the components of L1 
and L2 turns: 
ab – turn duration 
sp – intra-turn pause (after which the turn continues) 
lp – turn-final pause (giving up the turn) 
sab – simultaneous intra-turn speaking (failed attempt to take turn or give feed-
back)  
lab – turn-taking by simultaneous speaking 
The results are shown in Figure 13. 
We can see that the main difference between spontaneous Estonian dialogue and 
L1 exam dialogue lies in the turn duration, as the turns are longer at the exam. 
Turns are not taken by speaking simultaneously at the exam, though simultaneous 
speaking is used to give feedback. Exam dialogues also contain more intra-turn 
pauses than spontaneous speech, while in spontaneous speech turns are taken 
quickly. This is not the case at the exam, where one dialogue party tends to wait 
for the other to continue. Because of these differences, exam dialogue and 
spontaneous dialogue can be considered two distinct sub-genres. 
L2 dialogue is distinguishable by its long turns without pauses. There are also 
some cases of ultra-long monologue-like turns (see Table 5). 
Assessors of C1-level proficiency should be familiar with the nature of exam 
dialogues, so that the standard should be L1 exam dialogue and not spontaneous 
speech. Even if assessors accept longer turns at exams, they should bear in mind 
that monologue-like turns may indicate that the speaker has not mastered culture-
specific turn-taking rules.

3.5. Strength and disruptiveness of the foreign accent 
CEFR says of foreign accent at B1-level (p 117) that “Pronunciation is clearly 
intelligible even if a foreign accent is sometimes evident and occasional mispro-
nunciations occur.” At higher levels, CEFR dictates that there should be no 
noticeable foreign accent. 
Earlier, training accent-free pronunciation was an important part of language 
teaching. It was believed that “… the student should learn to speak the language as 
naturally as possible, free of any indication that the speaker is not a clinically 
normal native” (Griffen 1980/1991). Munro and Derwing (1999), who conducted 
empirical studies on accent, established that a strong foreign accent did not 
necessarily cause L2 speech to be low in comprehensibility or intelligibility, and 
therefore it would be impracticable to measure the strength of accent in the 
assessment of pronunciation. Research results also showed that listeners assessed 
the strength of accent subjectively. 
We asked two questions: 
• Do assessors register an accent in the pronunciation of high-level language 
users?  
• Does the accent disturb the assessors and to what extent? 
We conducted two experiments to find the answers. We asked all 8 assessors of 
the region to listen to a 20-second recording from each candidate. Research has 
shown that this might be the optimal length for recordings to assess accent (see 
Meister 2006, Meister and Meister 2007). In the first experiment, assessors had to 
score the strength of accent on a 6-point scale (1 = accent-free, 6 = very strong 
accent). In the second, conducted a month later, the assessors were asked how 
disruptive the accent was (1 = not disruptive at all, 6 = very disruptive). 
We also counted the number of pronunciation mistakes and language mistakes 
in each recording. By correlating the strength and disruptiveness of the accent with 
the score given for speaking skills, the number of pronunciation mistakes and the 
number of language mistakes, we got the result we had expected. The strength of 
the accent and disruptiveness of the accent are directly related, and the number of 
pronunciation errors is related to both. Curiously, scores are affected by the 
number of pronunciation errors but not by grammar mistakes. This shows that 
accent may have a greater effect on the scores of speaking skills than other 
mistakes, as illustrated in Table 6. 
When we compare the scores given to the strength and disruptiveness of the 
accents, we can see that not all professional assessors perceive the strength of 
accent in the same way, as for example, there is a significant difference in how 
Hille Pajupuu, Krista Kerge, Lya Meister, Eva Liina Asu and Pilvi Alp 134
assessors A1 and A3 registered the strength of the accents (Figure 14). The dis-
ruptiveness of accent is even more subjective, as some assessors are not at all 
disturbed by accents (A6), while some others clearly are (A1 and A8) (see 
Figure 15).

Natural speaking 135 
Although C-1 level language users may have quite strong accents, these should 
not be considered in the assessment of language use because of the high level of 
subjectivity, unless the accent impairs understanding. Accent only deserves atten-
tion in the assessment of C1 fluency if there are unnatural pauses. 
 
3.6. Intonation 
Another aspect that contributes to the perception of foreign accent is intonation 
(e.g. Magen 1998, Wennerstrom 2001). Being extremely language-specific, into-
nation is one of the first features acquired in the process of L1 acquisition, and 
among the last to be mastered in adult L2 acquisition. Within the present study we 
were above all interested in the issue of language transfer in patterns of rising 
intonation which occurred phrase- or utterance-finally before pauses. We asked 
two questions: 
• Which L1 patterns of rising intonation are transferred to L2? 
• How is the transfer of intonation patterns connected to the degree of per-
ceived foreign accent? 
Recent experimental accounts of Estonian intonation (e.g. Keevallik 2003, Asu 
2006) show that phrase-final rises are very common in colloquial Estonian, and are 
mainly used for signalling continuation and incompleteness. Thus, rising intona-
tion forms part of the Estonian intonational phonology and should be included in 
the model of natural spoken Estonian. A rise in Estonian can start at a low level on 
an accented syllable and end high at the phrase boundary (see Estonian contour (b) 
in Figure 16), or a rise starts on or immediately after the accented syllable and is 
followed by a high plateau (Estonian contour (a) in Figure 16). 
Rising intonation is even more common in Russian. The transcription system of 
Russian intonation (ToRI) developed by Odé (2008) includes three intonation 
patterns involving a rise. In one of them, the intonation contour forms a high 
plateau after a rise to the accented syllable (Russian contour (a) in Figure 16). 
Another rising contour consists of a low accented syllable preceded by a fall and 
followed by a rise (Russian contour (b) in Figure 16). This pattern is described in 
the ToRI system as a fall-rise, which among other discourse functions conveys 
incompleteness. The third pattern is a rise-fall characterised by an intonation 
contour which ends at a mid-level rather than at the bottom of the speaker’s range 
(Russian contour (c) in Figure 16). Thus, both languages contain rises but there are 
important differences in the realisation of Estonian and Russian contours. 
For the purposes of this study, the eight L2 speakers were divided into three 
groups on the basis of the results of an error analysis carried out by Meister and 
Meister (2007), who showed that a higher degree of accent was associated with a 
higher score of pronunciation errors. The three proficiency levels, according to the 
degree of perceived Russian accent were as follows: (1) near-native (error rate 0), 
(2) moderate accent (error rate 0.10–0.32), and (3) strong accent (error rate 0.67–
0.70). We would expect L1 intonation patterns to transfer to L2 particularly in case 
of those speakers who have a strong perceived foreign accent. 
Hille Pajupuu, Krista Kerge, Lya Meister, Eva Liina Asu and Pilvi Alp 136
The analysis shows that the frequency of rising intonation and the intonation 
patterns of the L2 speakers in the near-native group are similar to those of the L1 
speakers of Estonian. No rising intonation patterns seem to be transferred from L1 
to L2, which suggests that these speakers have mastered this aspect of L2 into-
nation. Interestingly also, the Estonian rise ending in a high boundary (Estonian 
pattern (b)) occurs only in the speech of these speakers and not in the case of the 
two other groups. 
In L2 Estonian with moderate or strong accent, there appeared a straight-
forward transfer of at least one rising pitch accent from the intonation system of 
L1 into L2; the L1 intonation pattern with a high plateau (Russian pattern (a)) was 
often used instead of the Estonian pattern ending in a plateau (Estonian pattern (a)) 
in order to signal continuation from the part of the speaker. Both rises are similar 
in that they end in a high plateau, but differ in that in the Estonian pattern, the rise 
starts after the low accented syllable, whereas in the Russian pattern, the rise 
occurs already before the high accented syllable (see Figure 16). 
The transfer of this intonation pattern into L2 contributes to the impression of 
foreign accent and makes a speaker sound more non-native. Such transfers were 
more noticeable in the speech of these L2 speakers who were youngest (18–23 
years old) and whose acquisition period of L2 had been shortest. The contour only 
present in the data of the L2 speakers from the strong accent group was the rising-
falling pattern ending at a mid-level (Russian pattern (c)). Such a pattern is typical 
of Russian but does not occur in Estonian, where a fall always reaches the bottom 
of the speaker’s range. 
The results of the study stress the fact that intonation is one of the most 
challenging aspects of pronunciation to master in a foreign language, and imply 
that transfer of intonation patterns contributes to the perception of foreign accent.

4. Conclusion 
 
Our research showed that in natural or L1 use of Estonian, oral monologue is 
slightly richer in vocabulary than dialogue, and written text is considerably richer 
in vocabulary than oral production. We established that although the vocabulary 
range of L1 users mostly remains within the 3,000 most frequently used words in 
Estonian, the share of rare words (almost 20%) is remarkably equal in the different 
types of oral production and similarly high in written texts. Most L1 rare words are 
nouns used as thematic vocabulary, and the share of them is two to three times 
higher within this vocabulary range of texts than in the average. 
When looking at the vocabulary range and degree of nominalisation, we 
noticed the great importance of word-formation in natural speech: in general, rare 
words contain many compounds and derivations and deverbal nominalisation 
plays an especially important role in the written text. 
In the natural language use, the oral monologue is more formal than the dia-
logue and the written text is more formal than the oral production.  
C1-level L2 users of Estonian differ from L1 users in most aspects that were 
researched: L2 vocabulary is poorer and the role of word-formation smaller; turns 
are longer; and the written text is far less nominalised, all of which is accompanied 
by accents and foreign intonation. However, there is something L1 and L2 users 
have in common, and this is the perception of text-type. L1 and L2 texts have a 
similar degree of formality, vocabulary range and variability, which means that L2 
users can choose words that are appropriate to the expected degree of formality of 
the text-type and their speech contains a natural weighting of words from different 
ranges of frequency. It is clear that in neither the oral monologue and dialogue, nor 
in oral and written production does their choice of words overlap more than that of 
native speakers. 
At the same time, L2 exam results show that the candidates coped with the 
language tasks they had been given. Regardless of the differences we established, 
the assessors considered the language proficiency of all our subjects sufficient for 
a certificate, which means that their production must have seemed quite natural. 
We can assume that the mistakes found in the pronunciation of L2 users did not 
stop them from completing their tasks, as their choice of words and use of parts-
of-speech were natural. 
It is important that the guidelines for assessing speaking skills in C1-level 
language exams take this into consideration (for now we are leaving aside the 
conclusions on written production which we only researched for the purpose of 
comparison). 
Earlier analyses of assessors indicate that they focus on different aspects of 
proficiency: some of them expect grammatical correctness or fluency, while others 
measure vocabulary range, and so forth. This explains why candidates may receive 
different scores from different assessors. Incidentally, it has been proven that 
assessor training has a relatively short-term effect (Bonk and Ockey 2003, Eckes 
2008, Lumley and McNamara 1995, Orr 2002). To reduce the effect of assessors, 
Hille Pajupuu, Krista Kerge, Lya Meister, Eva Liina Asu and Pilvi Alp 138
assessment guidelines should clearly indicate the criteria that C1-level language 
users must meet in the light of our research results, i.e. their production must be 
appropriate to the text-type. Mistakes that do not inhibit the completion of the task 
should go unnoticed. 
We should also highlight our results on the assessment of speech parameters, 
where accent deserves special attention. First, our research results challenge the 
presumption of CEFR 2001 (see 5.2.1.4) that from B1-level upwards, L2 users can 
already speak accent-free. Second, we established that some assessors tend to 
assess the whole language proficiency of a candidate based on his or her accent. It 
appeared that assessors were especially subjective in assessing the accent, so to 
ensure objectivity, the C1-level assessment guidelines should emphasise that an 
accent should not be decisive in the assessment of the overall proficiency of a 
candidate, unless it stops him or her from completing the task. This also applies to 
intonation which is directly related to the accent. Assessors need to bear in mind 
that rising intonation is also natural in Estonian, and the use of it should not be 
considered a mistake in L2, even if the exact patterns of rising intonation of L2 
users might be different. 
As for other results, we would like to point out that the great share of foreign 
stems in speech is not only an understanding strategy used by beginner-level L2 
speakers, but also describes a coping strategy that C-level users employ. Task-
specific L2 rare vocabulary contains considerably more foreign stems than L1 (see 
CEFR 2001 part 4.4.2.2 for comparison). The great importance of word-formation 
in L1 use is also significant, and we can conclude that the importance of word-
formation should be stressed in C1-level language learning objectives. However, 
because of their different linguistic background, L2 users may never practice word 
formation to the same extent that L1 users do, and therefore this skill should not be 
assessed separately.
