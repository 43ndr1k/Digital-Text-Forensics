Changes in Style in Authors with
Alzheimer’s Disease
Graeme Hirst and Vanessa Wei Feng
Even in its very early stages, Alzheimer’s disease leads to changes in language that can be
detected by computational analysis. These changes may include a reduced, vaguer, and
more abstract vocabulary, and reduced syntactic complexity. But do these changes affect
an author’s essential style? We experiment with a number of standard features for
authorship attribution and authorship verification to see whether they recognize late
works written by authors known to have had Alzheimer’s disease as being by the same
author as their earlier works. The authors whom we study are Iris Murdoch and Agatha
Christie. Our control author (without Alzheimer’s) is P. D. James. Our results were
equivocal, as different frameworks yielded contrary results, but an SVM classifier was
able to make age discriminations, or nearly so, for all three authors, thereby casting
doubt on the underlying axiom that an author’s essential style is invariant in the absence
of cognitive decline.
1. Language Changes in Alzheimer’s Disease
In the dementia associated with Alzheimer’s disease, all cognitive abilities decline,
including language, and even though there is considerable variation across
individuals, there are regular patterns of linguistic deficits in Alzheimer’s dementia
that differ from those in other dementias and aphasias.1 These changes may include a
reduced, vaguer, and more abstract vocabulary, and reduced syntactic complexity,
with less frequent use of the passive voice, and they differ greatly in magnitude from
the mild changes normally seen in healthy aging.2 Thus a decline over time in an
individual’s richness of vocabulary and complexity of syntax that is greater than the
normal changes of aging may be an indication of Alzheimer’s disease.3

Xuan Le, Ian Lancashire, Graeme Hirst, and Regina Jokel studied changes over
time in the language of three British novelists: Iris Murdoch, Agatha Christie, and P.
D. James.4 Iris Murdoch is known to have died of Alzheimer’s disease5 and declined
greatly while writing her last novel, Jackson’s Dilemma. Agatha Christie, whose final
novels were of low quality, was suspected of having Alzheimer’s disease but was never
diagnosed.6 P. D. James was still fully active, her health not in doubt, at the time of Le
et al.’s study.
Le et al. found that in Murdoch’s and Christie’s late novels, their vocabulary was
less rich, they repeated phrases more often, they used many more vague words and
filler words, and overall they used fewer nouns and more verbs, whereas James
showed no such changes. Murdoch and Christie also showed decreases in the use of
the passive voice, consistent with Alzheimer’s disease, and again James did not.
However, Le et al. did not observe in Murdoch and Christie the more general drop in
syntactic complexity usually associated with Alzheimer’s disease. But there are wide
individual variations in the effects of the disease, and Le et al. concluded from their
results that Agatha Christie probably did have Alzheimer’s disease, and that her last
three novels were written in a period of serious decline. Moreover, they showed that
the early stages of the decline are visible in her novels of the preceding decade. Le
et al. also found that Murdoch showed a significant decline and possible indications
of problems even in her fifties, which were a troubled time for her,7 with a recovery in
her sixties before her final rather precipitous decline.
Le et al.’s results raise questions about authorial style and authorship attribution. It
is a tenet of research on intrinsic methods of authorship attribution that each author
has a unique and invariable ‘‘signature’’ that characterizes their writing—a signature
that results from the combination of hundreds of largely unconscious predispositions
and preferences that are reflected in every lexical and syntactic choice that the author
makes in their writing.8 Quantifiable elements of an author’s signature include
vocabulary size and distribution, average word and sentence length, distribution of
prepositions and other function words, and frequency of various syntactic
constructions.9 The author’s essential stylistic signature is taken to be largely
independent of the topics upon which they write, and invariant, or largely so, even
across different genres in which they write.
This tenet is challenged by the notion that diachronic changes in cognition, such as
those of the early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, might change these predispositions
and preferences, or at least reduce the ability to act on them, and thus the author’s
signature might change to the extent that it is no longer recognizable as that of the
author’s earlier work. After all, some of the attributes commonly taken as

components of an author’s signature are attributes that change significantly in
Alzheimer’s disease—vocabulary richness and the frequency of certain syntactic
constructions.10 But on the other hand, it’s also possible that many or most
components of an author’s signature do not change, even in Alzheimer’s disease,11
and the essence of the author’s individual style continues to shine through.
We can frame this as a question in authorship attribution or authorship
verification: using standard features for stylistic analysis, other than those known to
change in Alzheimer’s disease, can we recognize the work of an Alzheimer’s-affected
author as being written by the same author as that of his or her younger self, or do
they appear to be two different authors? The use of standard features is important in
this question. While we might find characteristics of the author’s writing that are
invariant even in cognitive decline, they do not answer our question about their
stylistic signature unless they are characteristics that have been generally accepted in
research on style as relevant to identifying individual authors.
It should be noted that this is not a question about authors’ ‘‘late style’’ per se,
which is a largely semantic or thematic notion related to the writer’s outlook or view
as it develops in their older years (‘‘a new idiom’’ of ‘‘their work and thought’’12).
Late style is not a matter of superficial linguistic realization, except only insofar as
expression of the writer’s new view might lead to some changes to preferences in
surface realization.13
In this paper, we use authorship attribution and verification methods to investigate
whether an author’s essential stylistic signature changes in Alzheimer’s disease.
2. Authorship Attribution and Authorship Verification
The hypothesis that we test is that intrinsic methods will distinguish ‘‘old’’ Agatha
Christie and Iris Murdoch as different authors from their younger selves, but will not
distinguish ‘‘old’’ P. D. James as different from her younger self. That is, in addition
to the direct linguistic deficits that it induces, Alzheimer’s disease changes the
authors’ styles in detectable ways. The alternative (the null hypothesis) is that
Alzheimer’s disease does not change the writer’s essential style, and that any
differences seen are no larger than those seen over time in a healthily aging author.
10Maxim and Bryan.
11We are speaking here, of course, of the earlier stages of Alzheimer’s, in which the patient is still able to write,
albeit perhaps poorly, as Murdoch and Christie did. In the later stages of the disease, when linguistic abilities
may break down completely, the question becomes meaningless.
12Said, 6.
13Ian Lancashire (218) points to Anne M. Wyatt-Brown’s characterization of the late style of Barbara Pym,
which reflects both a new world view and its surface realization: ‘‘Most reviewers and friends commented upon
the uncharacteristic undercurrents of depression and melancholy. . . . Furthermore, she herself described her
desire to pare down her writing, to make things spare’’ (Wyatt-Brown, 837). But it remains an open question as
to whether Pym’s new spareness or conciseness (‘‘Pym had concentrated so passionately on making her point
that later she had to add 12,000 words to make her manuscript publishable’’ [ibid.]) resulted in any marked
change in the stylometrics of her writing.

We test the hypothesis in two experimental frameworks: authorship attribution and
authorship verification.
These two frameworks must be carefully distinguished.14 In the framework of
authorship attribution, we have a disputed text known to be written by one of a
relatively small set of authors, and our task is to find the closest match of the stylistic
signature of the text to those of the candidate authors: was this mystery play written
by Shakespeare, Sheridan, or Shaw? We can answer the question by inducing a
discriminative classifier from attested texts of the candidates and seeing which author
it attributes the mystery text to. In the case of our particular hypothesis, this reduces
to the simpler question of whether a classifier can be built at all to discriminate the
works of the older author from those of her younger days. If the classifier cannot be
built—that is, if no reliable and meaningful discriminating stylometric features can
be found—then we may conclude that the author’s style has not changed.
In the framework of authorship verification, the disputed text might or might not
have been written by one particular author, but there are no specific known
alternative candidates for authorship: was this mystery play written by Shakespeare or
not? In this situation, the notion of closest match does not apply, nor do we have any
a priori notion of what would count as a close enough match to the single candidate
author; so the standard text-classification methods of intrinsic authorship attribution
cannot be used. Instead, a method known as unmasking may be used. In the case of
our hypothesis, we ask whether each work of the older author was or wasn’t written
by the ‘‘same’’ author as the works of her younger days.
Unmasking is a technique developed by Moshe Koppel and Jonathan Schler.15 It is
based on the idea that if two texts were written by the same author, then any features
a classifier finds that (spuriously) discriminate their authorship must be weak and
few in number, and removal of these features from the classifier will seriously degrade
its performance (thereby ‘‘unmasking’’ the spurious discrimination). On the other
hand, if the texts were written by different authors, then many features will support
their (correct) discrimination and removal of even a few strongly discriminating
features will not seriously harm the classifier. The method proceeds as follows:
classifiers are induced not only for the disputed text and its candidate author but also
for the disputed text and other authors similar to the candidate (Koppel and
colleagues used a variety of nineteenth-century English-language writers in their
experiments). The most discriminating features are progressively removed from each
classifier and its performance is re-evaluated. If performance falls off far more rapidly
for the candidate author, authorship is deemed to be verified. Recognizing when a
‘‘serious’’ decline in performance has occurred is a problem in meta-learning that we
omit the details of here; the interested reader is referred to Koppel and Schler.16

3. Experiments
3.1 Method
3.1.1 Data
We use the same data as Le et al.: fifteen novels of Agatha Christie, including three of
her very early novels (ages twenty-eight to thirty-four) and her final three novels from
ages eighty to eighty-two; twenty novels of Iris Murdoch, including seven of her first
eight novels and her final two; and fifteen novels of P. D. James, including her first
eight and most recent five.
We divided each author’s novels into those of the author’s prime, those of the
transition period when the author is approaching her late period, and those of her
late period (see Appendix 1). In the case of Murdoch and Christie, the late period
contains novels in which the effects of Alzheimer’s disease are possibly evident, as
indicated by Le et al.’s results. The prime period contains novels in which there are
presumed to be no effects of Alzheimer’s. Novels of the transition period are those for
which such judgements are less certain; in particular, as we noted earlier, Le et al.
found possible indications of problems in Murdoch’s novels even in her fifties, so we
begin her transition period at age fifty. For James, we made a division roughly similar
to Christie’s.
We divided each novel into large chunks and into small chunks. The large chunks
were approximately 100 sentences long, breaking only at paragraph and chapter
boundaries. For simplicity, we will refer to these as 100-sentence chunks, even though
the number is approximate. We took these chunks as the basic unit of text in our
preliminary study and in the authorship attribution study (sections 3.2 and 3.3
below). They averaged just over 4,000 words—large enough to be representative,
while giving us a sufficient number of textual units for each author for our
experiments (see Table 1). The small chunks averaged 542 words; they were made by
breaking at the first paragraph boundary after 500 words. The small chunks were used
in the authorship verification study (sections 3.2 and 3.4 below); for simplicity, we
shall refer to them as 500-word chunks.
3.1.2 Classifier
We used support vector machines (SVMs) as the classifiers in all our experiments.
SVMs are classifiers commonly used in machine learning and data mining; they have
shown competitive performance in authorship attribution research, and were used by
Koppel et al. in their experiments on authorship verification.17 Specifically, we use
the LibSVM classifier18 of the Weka toolkit19 in all our experiments.

3.1.3 Features
The 262 stylometric features that we used (Appendix 2) are features that, broadly
speaking, have been found to be effective in authorship attribution, including
frequencies of function words, of characters, and of character n-grams. Many are
features that were tested for effectiveness in a study by Jack Grieve, who found
grapheme-based measures to be surprisingly effective.20 However, in this study we
exclude stylometric features whose values Le et al. found to change in Alzheimer’s
disease—part-of-speech frequency and vocabulary richness—as it is the stability of
the others that we wish to investigate. We do, however, include the frequency of the
twenty most frequent part-of-speech bigrams in the text and the entropy of the part-
of-speech tags (see Appendix 2 for the definition) because, although these two
features share a large amount of information with part-of-speech frequencies, they
are effective in discriminating different authors21 and Le et al. did not explore the
correlation between longitudinal changes in these features and the presence of
Alzheimer’s disease.
In addition, for the preliminary study of authorship verification (section 3.2), we
used, as a second feature set, the frequencies of the 250 most frequent words in the texts
under consideration. We do this in order to follow Koppel and colleagues, who used
the n words with the highest frequency in the data as a feature set in all their unmask-
ing experiments, finding n¼ 250 to be a suitable value. We determined the set of words
by the same method that they did, weighting frequency equally between the mystery
text and the set of comparator texts. Many of these 250 most frequent words will be
function words that are also used in the stylometric feature set (Appendix 2).
3.2 Preliminary Study: Authorship Attribution and Verification without Regard to Age
We verified in a preliminary study that our stylometric feature set is effective for
authorship attribution and for authorship verification and that unmasking can
discriminate between our three authors, without taking their age into account.

The first of these preliminary experiments used the authorship attribution
framework. For each pair of authors, we took the set of all 100-sentence chunks of
text by either author and trained an SVM classifier for the authors with the
stylometric features. We also trained a three-way classifier with the texts of all three
authors. The accuracy of classification, tested with ten-fold cross-validation, is shown
in Table 2; baseline is the accuracy obtained by always picking the author with the
largest number of texts in the data.
We see that these stylometric features are effective for authorship attribution on
this set of writers. The accuracy is somewhat lower than is sometimes seen in
authorship attribution studies, but this may be attributed to our deliberate avoidance
of vocabulary and part-of-speech features.
The second of these preliminary experiments used the authorship verification
framework. We used both our stylometric feature set (Appendix 2) and for
comparison, following Koppel and colleagues, a feature set of the 250 most frequent
words in the texts, as described in section 3.1 above. And also following Koppel and
colleagues, we used our smaller 500-word chunks of text in this experiment.
For each of the fifty novels and for each author, we used unmasking to test whether
that novel was written by that author. Thus there were 150 test cases. The results are
shown in Table 3. Both feature sets achieved an accuracy of approximately 89 per
Table 2 Accuracy (%) of Classification of Each Pair of Authors Studied, and of Three-
Way Classification of All Authors (the novels of all the authors’ periods have been used,
with the stylometric features of Appendix 2 and an SVM classifier; the baseline is

cent (specifically, the 250-word feature set was correct in one case more than the
stylometric feature set), well above the baselines of 40 per cent (always saying that the
book was written by the most frequent author, Iris Murdoch), and 50 per cent
(making the decision of same or different author at random with equal probability).
Thus, we see that unmasking is an effective authorship verification method for these
data, and that our standard stylometric feature set is as effective in unmasking as that
of Koppel and colleagues and is therefore suitable for use in our age-based unmasking
experiments below.
3.3 Discriminating Ages in the Authorship Attribution Framework
We next tested whether we can distinguish the two Alzheimer’s-affected authors from
their younger selves, with P. D. James as a control subject. We did this by seeing
whether it was possible to build for each author a binary classifier based on
stylometric features that could discriminate her prime-period work from her late-
period work (we ignored data from the transition period in order to separate the
author’s work into two clear cases). If our hypothesis is correct, we should be able to
do this for Murdoch and Christie but not James. As in our preliminary study, we
used 100-sentence chunks of text for each author; the number of chunks for each
period is shown in Table 1.
The results are shown in Table 4. The baseline for comparison is the accuracy
obtained by always choosing the more frequent period, which is the prime period in
all cases. Because Murdoch and Christie have much more work in this period, this is
a high baseline for them. P is the probability that the classifier is operating at the
baseline chance level, as determined by the exact binomial test (using the R statistical
software package22). We see that the difference is significant for Christie and James
while barely even approaching mild significance for Murdoch.
Thus, in accordance with our hypothesis, we are able to use stylometric features to
discriminate Christie’s work by age in the authorship attribution framework, but,

contrary to our hypothesis we could also do so for James and we could not do so for
Murdoch.
3.4 Discriminating Ages in the Authorship Verification Framework
We used the unmasking technique of Koppel and colleagues to determine whether
each author’s late-period work could be verified as having the same author as her
prime-period work. If our hypothesis is correct, we should be able to verify this for
James but not for Murdoch or Christie.
Separately for each author, we did the following with our stylometric features
and the 500-word-chunk dataset: for each novel by that author, except for those in
the transition period, and for each period, prime and late, we used unmasking to
test whether that novel was written in that period. There are two baselines in this
experiment. As in the classification experiment (section 3.3, Table 4), an informed
baseline is verifying authorship as the more frequent ‘‘author’’, the prime period, in
all cases—that is, asserting identity of authorship in all cases when the prime period
is the target and denying it in all cases when the late period is the target. But such
an informed baseline is perhaps unrealistic in the authorship verification
framework, so we also consider the uninformed baselines of equiprobable random
choice and of always denying identity of authorship (which would be a high
baseline in the realistic situation in which most work tested is not that of the target
author). For our data, these baselines are equivalent, both giving 50 per cent
accuracy.
The results are shown in Table 5. P is the probability that the classifier is
operating at the baseline chance level, as determined by the exact binomial test.
We see that in all three cases, unmasking is operating at chance level compared to
the informed baseline; in fact, for Murdoch and Christie, it performs markedly
worse than just choosing the prime period for all cases. That is, unmasking cannot
find any features in the stylometric feature set that reliably discriminate the age of
any of the authors. This contrasts with our results for binary SVM classification,
where, using the same feature set, we were able to make a significant

discrimination for two of our three authors. On the other hand, unmasking did
achieve a significantly better result than the uninformed baseline for Murdoch,
and approached significance for James; it did not do so for Christie. This result is
contrary to that of SVM classification (Table 4), where Murdoch was the most
poorly discriminated author.
Thus, contrary to our hypothesis, we were not able to use stylometric features to
discriminate Christie’s and Murdoch’s work by age in the authorship verification
framework, except that for Murdoch we could discriminate better than an
uninformed baseline. However, in accordance with our hypothesis, we could not
discriminate James either, though we came very close to significance against the
uninformed baseline.
4. Discussion
The inconsistency in our results draws attention to methodological issues. On the
one hand, binary SVM classification—a well-established method—was able to make
discriminations between the prime and late periods of Christie and James using
well-established stylometric features, and came close to doing so for Murdoch.
From this we can conclude that these authors’ styles changed in old age, but
because this was so for P. D. James as well as our Alzheimer’s-affected authors, we
can draw no conclusions about changes that might be directly due to Alzheimer’s
disease. It is notable that we found changes in James’s writing with regard to
stylometric features even though Le et al. found no significant changes in her
writing with regard to features that are known to commonly change in Alzheimer’s
disease. This supports the idea that these sets of features do not co-vary and hence,
in principle at least, the stylometric features could largely remain unchanged even
in Alzheimer’s, even if they didn’t do so in the present cases of Christie and, to a

On the other hand, unmasking could not discriminate the authors by age very well,
or could not do so at all, depending on what baseline was chosen. Unmasking is a less
well-established method; although Koppel and colleagues report good results with it,
and it worked well in our preliminary study, it has not been widely used by other
researchers. Possibly, in view of the SVM results, it is not suitable for this kind of
authorship verification; that is, the features do not behave in the manner that the
method assumes.
Thus our hypothesis that Alzheimer’s disease would lead to changes in an author’s
essential style, distinct from the linguistic changes seen in cognitive decline, is neither
supported nor falsified. Rather, one of our underlying axioms—the invariance of an
author’s essential stylistic signature, as reflected in standard stylometric features, in
the absence of cognitive decline—is brought into question. Most research on
authorship attribution by stylometric features focuses on the author’s work as a
whole, seeking features that reflect differentiation from other authors and hence
similarity among the author’s various works rather than differences. Determining the

effects of cognitive decline on an author’s essential style first requires a better
understanding of the norms of diachronic changes in style.23
