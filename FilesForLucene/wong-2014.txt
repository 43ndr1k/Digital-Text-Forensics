Sentence boundary detection (SBD) system is normally quite sensitive to genres of data that the system is trained on. The genres
of data are often referred to the shifts of text topics and new languages domains. Although new detection models can be retrained
for different languages or new text genres, previous model has to be thrown away and the creation process has to be restarted
from scratch. In this paper, we present a multilingual sentence boundary detection system (iSentenizer-𝜇) for Danish, German,
English, Spanish, Dutch, French, Italian, Portuguese, Greek, Finnish, and Swedish languages.The proposed system is able to detect
the sentence boundaries of a mixture of different text genres and languages with high accuracy. We employ i+Learning algorithm,
an incremental tree learning architecture, for constructing the system. iSentenizer-𝜇, under the incremental learning framework,
is adaptable to text of different topics and Roman-alphabet languages, by merging new data into existing model to learn the new
knowledge incrementally by revision instead of retraining. The system has been extensively evaluated on different languages and
text genres and has been compared against two state-of-the-art SBD systems, Punkt and MaxEnt. The experimental results show
that the proposed system outperforms the other systems on all datasets.
1. Introduction
The task of sentence boundary detection or sentence bound-
ary disambiguation (SBD) is to identify the sentence elements
within a text. Many natural language processing (NLP) sys-
tems generally take a sentence as an input unit—part of
speech (POS) tagging [1], chunking [2], and parsing [3],
machine translation (MT) [4], information retrieval (IR) [5],
and so forth. The SBD, acting as an initial processing step
in most of the NLP applications, seems too simple to get
the attention from the researchers. In fact, it is a nontrivial
task, since the errors of the SBD system propagate into the
subsequent processes when they rely on accurate sentence
segmentation, and the overall system performance is nega-
tively affected.
The isolation of sentences involves resolving the use of
ambiguous punctuations to determine if the current punctu-
ation is a true delimiter [6]. In English, a period “.,” which
is used to signal the end of a sentence, may also be used to
denote an abbreviation, acronym, a decimal point, ellipses,
and separators in e-mail andWorldWideWeb addresses.This
ambiguitymay become serious when the trailing period of an
abbreviation or initial also represents the end of a sentence
(e.g., When I was in Macau S.A.R., I lived on Taipa Island).
Second, the sentence is generally started with capitalized
words. If the word following the period is part of proper
nouns which is always capitalized, we should not denote the
word as the start of the next sentence. All these together
make the disambiguation problemmore complicated in SBD.
On the other hand, the ambiguity of the punctuations varies
according to different text genres or specific corpus. In the
Wall Street Journal (WSJ), about 42% of the periods denote
abbreviations and decimal points while the corresponding
percentage for Brown corpus is only 11%. That means if
we simply treat every period as the boundary delimiter
of a sentence, it is able to correctly detect about 58% of
the sentences in the WSJ corpus and about 89% of the
Brown corpus. The colon “:,” semicolon “;,” and comma “,”
can either be a separator of grammatical subsentences or
a delimiter of sentences. About 19% and 14% of colons are
being used as the boundary delimiters of sentences in the
WSJ and Brown corpus, respectively. This brings another
ambiguity of punctuation mark in addition to the period.
While semicolon and comma normally are not considered
as the end of sentence markers. There are only less than
0.5% of sentences ended with a semicolon or a comma in

the WSJ and Brown corpus, and can be negligible. Other
possible sentence boundary markers are the exclamation “!”
and question “?” marks. They are generally unambiguous in
denoting the end of sentences. Hence, the most ambiguous
punctuation is the period. In order to implement a reliable
SBD model, sophisticated logics and algorithms are required
to tackle the problem.
Various algorithms have been employed to achieve the
sentence boundary detection in different languages. Recent
research works in SBD mainly focus on using machine
learning techniques, such as the decision tree [7], the neural
network [7], the hidden Markov model [8], the maximum
entropy [9], and the conditional random fields [10–12]. They
treat the detection task as a classification problem. Although
these methods are very successful when applied to an indi-
vidual language and specific corpus, it remains unclear how
well those methods operate if they are applied on a mixture
sample of languages and varieties of text genres. Second,
the suggested algorithms for the SBD tasks are generally
constructed in an offline fashion. Once the model is created,
it cannot be altered. Even when the constructed SBD system
is adapted to the sample of text which is characteristically
different from where it is trained on, it is unable to fine-tune
the configuration of the system. This is very important since,
in the recent years, there has been a dramatic increase in
the collection of online texts for the creation of (multilingual
sentence alignment) parallel corpora [13]. The texts are
usually of a high variety of sources, genres, domains, and
formats over the online content.This poses a special problem
for SBD applications. In this paper, we propose amultilingual
sentence boundary disambiguation system, iSentenizer-𝜇,
as an extension of our previous work [14], based on the
incremental learning framework, i+Learning principle [15],
to deal with the problem we posed. That is different from the
existing works reported in the literature.
2. Related Work
In the literature, several sentence boundary detection systems
have been reported, and basically these systems can be cate-
gorized into two types according to the different approaches
the systems use. The works of Grefenstette and Tapanainen
[6] and Silla et al. [16] are the representative of rule-based
approach. The systems encode rules as regular expressions
and use set of regular expressions to represent the possible
patterns of nonboundary period that mark abbreviations,
numbers, and other sequences like email and web addresses.
In classification, period in the text is checked and surround-
ing context is analyzed against the regular expressions. If
any regular expression of which is matched, then the period
is determined as an abbreviation marker; otherwise, it is
considered as a sentence separator. However, rules are never
exhaustive, hard to prevent from conflicts, and not robust to
the text with domains and genre shifts. The second type of
boundary detection systems is based on machine learning
approaches. It treats the detection task as a classification prob-
lem, using features of the local context of potential boundary
markers such as spelling of word, capitalization, length of
abbreviation, and part of speech. Compared to manually
constructed systems, machine learning models are easier
to develop since only annotated training data is required
[17]. The representative systems based on this approach
are Satz [7] and MxTerminator [9]. The Satz uses either
a C4.5 decision tree or a neural network to disambiguate
the role of punctuation mark in a sentence, using the prior
distributions of word class surrounding the possible end-of-
sentence punctuationmark as features. While MxTerminator
applies the maximum entropy model to learn the contextual
features of ambiguous punctuations by considering the token
preceding and following a sentence boundary, together with
the heuristic information regarding the abbreviations from
the annotated training corpus. Kiss and Strunk [18] propose
an unsupervised sentence boundary detection system Punkt
that uses collocation information as evidence derived from
unannotated corpora for detecting abbreviations, initials,
and ordinal numbers. The collocation information and other
model parameters are empirically derived from a large
development corpus of the Wall Street Journal. Although the
system based on machine learning approach is easier to con-
struct, once it is built, the system cannot be changed. In par-
ticular, when new domains or text genres are introduced that
have different characteristics from its original development
data, all the previously learnt knowledge must be discarded.
Recently, Wong and Chao [14] propose an online adaptive
SBD system to dealwith the shifts of text topics on the fly.New
data are incrementally learned and are ready to be detected
by the revised system. However, the suggested method was
tested on two languages only, English and Portuguese. It is
unclear howwell the performance is if it is applied on amixed
data of wider languages and varieties of text genres. In this
research, the proposed system is constructed to detect the
boundaries of multilingual text and is extensively tested on
eleven different languages and different corpora, including
the parallel corpus of Europarl [13].
3. Proposed Model
Theproposed SBDmodel is constructed based on i+Learning
algorithm. The i+Learning stands for intelligent, interactive,
and dynamic learning architecture, which complements the
incremental learning algorithms in terms of performing
knowledge revision in multiple dimensions. The algorithm
grows an on-going decision tree with respect to either the
new incoming instances or attributes in two phases: (1)
primary offline construction of decision tree (POFC-DT): a
fundamental decision tree construction phase in batch mode
that is based on the initial training data and (2) incremental
online revision of decision tree (IONR-DT) as incoming of
the new instances or feature attributes; existing tree model
is revised by incorporating the new knowledge instead of
retraining from scratch.
3.1. Primary Offline Construction of Decision Tree. This is
an ordinary top-down decision tree construction phase that
starts from the root node, using a splitting criterion to divide
classes as “pure” as possible until a stopping criterion is met.
The objective of this phase is to construct an optimal base
tree, in order to have a robust foundation for further tree
The Scientific World Journal 3
expansion. The binary tree structure is adopted in construct-
ing such base tree. Binary tree has the same representational
power as the nonbinary tree, but it is simpler in structure
and has no loss of the generated knowledge. This is because
the binary decision tree employs a strategy that a complex
problem is divided into simpler subproblems, in which it
divides an attribute space into two subspaces repeatedly, with
the terminal nodes associated with the classes [19].
To build a primitive binary tree, it starts from a root node
𝑑 derived from whichever attribute 𝑎
𝑖
in an attribute space
𝐴 that minimizes the impurity measure. A binary partition
can be denoted by a four-tuple representation (𝑑, 𝑇, 𝑑𝐿, 𝑑𝑅),
where 𝑑 is a decision node, 𝑇 is a splitting criterion on 𝑑,
and 𝑑𝐿 and 𝑑𝑅 are the node labels for partitions of the left
and right data sets, respectively. Due to a binary tree which
is a collection of nested binary partitions, thus it can be
represented in the following recursive form:
𝐷 = {(𝑑, 𝑇, 𝑑
𝐿
, 𝑑
𝑅
) , 𝐷
𝐿
, 𝐷
𝑅
} , (1)
where 𝐷𝐿 and 𝐷𝑅 denote the left and right subtrees, respec-
tively, which are induced by the partition node 𝑑 [20]. The
Kolmogorov-Smirnoff (KS) distance [21, 22] is employed as
themeasure of impurity at node 𝑑, which is denoted by 𝐼KS(𝑑)
and is shown in the equation below:
𝐼KS (𝑑) = max
V∈value(𝑑)
󵄨󵄨󵄨󵄨𝐹𝐿 (V) − 𝐹𝑅 (V)
󵄨󵄨󵄨󵄨 , (2)
where V denotes either the various values of a nominal
attribute 𝑎 with test criterion 𝑎 = V or a cut-point of a
continuous-valued attribute 𝑎 with test criterion 𝑎 < V; 𝐹
𝐿
(V)
and 𝐹
𝑅
(V) are two class-conditional cumulative distribution
functions that count the number of instances in the left and
right subtrees, respectively, which is partitioned by a value
V of an attribute 𝑎 at a decision node 𝑑. KS is a well-known
measure for the separability of two distribution functions;
it is especially simple and computationally efficient both in
the training and classification stages. Hence, a best single test
is picked across all attributes by enumerating the possible
tests and selecting the one with the greatest KS distance. A
decision tree grows by means of successive partitions until a
termination criterion is met.
3.2. Incremental Online Revision of Decision Tree. IONR-
DT phase acts as a central character in the incremental
decision tree algorithm. It embraces the faith that whenever
a new instance and/or a new attribute is coming, this phase
dynamically revises the fundamental tree constructed in
POFC-DT phase without sacrificing the final classification
accuracy and eventually produces a decision tree as same
as possible to those algorithms with all training examples
available at the beginning. IONR-DT phase adopts the tree
transposition mechanism that in ITI [23] as a basis to grow
and revise the base tree. Besides, it preserves the essential
statistical information to manage the decision tree. Such style
of decision tree differs from the batch mode trees, since
it remembers the information of instances regarding the
respective possible values as well as the class label, in order to
Table 1: Four classes of the importance grades.

process the transposition without rescanning the entire data
set repeatedly.
KS measure is again applied in this phase for evaluating
the goodness of a decision node. Once a set of new instances
is ready to be incorporated with an existing tree, IONR-DT
phase carries out the following several steps. (1) It updates
the statistical information on each node that the new instance
traversed. (2) It merges the new instance into an existing leaf
or grows the tree one level under a leaf. (3) It evaluates the
qualification for the test on each node downwards starting
from the root node. (4) For any attribute test that is no longer
best to be on a node, the pull-up tree transposition process is
called recursively to revise the existing decision tree. And (5)
a new decision tree is revised and ready to perform the next
classification.
3.3. Incremental Learning Regarding Attributes (i+LRA). If an
instance is available together with an unseen (new) attribute,
except the above general steps, an additional procedure for
incorporating a new attribute appropriately with an existing
decision tree has to be called subsequently. In this algorithm,
every new attribute is assigned with a weight of medium
importance by default, rather than treated as noise in other
learning algorithms [20], although its goodnessmeasurement
might be lower on its first occurrence. This is because,
for a new domain, when a new attribute is considered to
incorporate into the learning process, it should be logically
considered as one of the decision nodes, even though the
evidence is rare and the attributemight be irrelevant from the
statistical point of view.
Further significant, in order to avoid the situation that
an attribute has been appended mistakenly, i+LRA offers
an alternative way to empirically assign one of the four
predefined importance grades to an attribute. This charac-
teristic enables i+LRA algorithm to be flexible enough to
deal with the incremental data appropriately. Table 1 lists the
importance grading schema as well as the respective action
being taken during the tree revision process.
3.4. Importance Measure (𝐼KS). After selecting the impor-
tance grade from Table 1 for a new attribute, the crucial step
is to determine a preliminary coefficient W for its impurity
measure (𝐼KS). This coefficient is vital for a new attribute and
is used as a reference index for its importance measure. It
is computed only once for each importance grade, in order
4 The Scientific World Journal
to enable the new attribute to compete with its comparable
attributes in being a decision node.This coefficient is decided
as the ratio between the average KS measure of the attributes
in the same rank that the new attribute belongs to and the
KSmeasure of the new attribute itself.The following equation
illustrates the situation:
W =
mean (∑𝑙
𝑖=1
𝐼KS (𝑎𝑖))
𝐼KS (𝑎new)
, (3)
where 𝑎new is a new incoming attribute; 𝑎𝑖 is an attribute of
the same rank with 𝑎new; and 𝑙 is the total number of such
attributes, which is less than the total number of attributes in
the attribute space 𝐴; that is, 𝑙 ≤ |𝐴|. Once such preliminary
coefficient W for 𝑎new has been worked out, it could be
applied to 𝑎new by multiplying it to the KS measure of 𝑎new,
to enlarge the importance of 𝑎new according to the given
importance grade automatically. This strategy examines the
initial importance of 𝑎new regardless of its KS measure, which
can prevent an actually important new attribute being treated
as useless due to its newness, and occupies little training data.
Thereupon, a normal tree transposition process is carried
on as usual to properly fit the new attribute 𝑎new to a right
position.
4. Feature Representation
The features we used for constructing the iSentenizer-𝜇 are
derived from the trigram contexts of training corpus. That
includes the words immediately preceding and following the
potential boundary punctuation marks: period, exclamation
mark, colon, semicolon, question mark, quotation marks,
brackets, and dash. Normally, the punctuation marks of
the period and exclamation and question marks are only
considered as the potential sentence boundaries in related
SBD researches [9, 14, 24]. However, there are some cases
(depending on different corpora and text genres) where those
punctuation marks may also denote a sentence boundary.
Second, in order to maximize the adaptability of the system
for wider languages and text genres, the associated features
are encoded as a binary vector V (besides the features repre-
senting the length of surrounding words); each component
of V corresponds to a possible feature value 𝑏
𝑖
of feature 𝑓
𝑖
in
the feature set. The encoded type of features for constructing
the SBD system is therefore independent from specific corpus
and alphabet language since the system does not directly
rely on the orthographic information. In more details, the
information we use consists of the following features.
4.1. Character Features. Wefirst consider the capitalization of
the initial character of the word, including the immediately
preceding word 𝑓
1
(𝑤
𝑖−1
) and the following word 𝑓
2
(𝑤
𝑖+1
),
based on the following feature function:
𝑓
1,2
(𝑤
𝑖
) = {
1 𝑐
1
∈ C, 𝑤
𝑖
= {𝑐
1
, 𝑐
2
, . . . , 𝑐
𝑛
}
0 otherwise,
(4)
where C is the collection of capital letters; 𝑐
𝑖
∈ C × L is
a character, and 𝑛 is the word length |𝑤|. The capitalization
of a word gives an important clue to signal the named enti-
ties (names of people, places, organizations, artifacts, etc.),
abbreviations (e.g., Dr., Mr.), and acronyms (e.g., S.A.R.).
Different from previous works of [9, 25], we do not include
words prefixes or suffixes in our feature set; consider that affix
uses orthographic information and is not independent of any
specific language.
4.2. Word Features. Under the observation that abbrevia-
tions are generally the major source of ambiguities in the
determination of sentence boundaries.They are usually short,
uppercased, and tightly collocated with internal periods
(i.e., acronyms) or a final period (i.e., honorific abbrevi-
ations, location name abbreviations, month and measure
unit abbreviations, corporate designators, etc.) In addition
to the capitalized features, we also care about the upper-
/lowercasing of both the neighboring words, 𝑓
3
(𝑤
𝑖−1
) and
𝑓
4
(𝑤
𝑖+1
), defined as:
𝑓
3,4
(𝑤
𝑖
) = {
1 ∀𝑐
𝑖
∈ C, 𝑤
𝑖
= {𝑐
1
, 𝑐
2
, . . . , 𝑐
𝑛
}
0 otherwise.
(5)
Features five and six are considered as the length of previous
and next words, that is, 𝑓
5
(𝑤
𝑖−1
) and 𝑓
6
(𝑤
𝑖+1
), respectively,
and are given by
𝑓
5,6
(𝑤
𝑖
) =
󵄨󵄨󵄨󵄨𝑤𝑖
󵄨󵄨󵄨󵄨 . (6)
4.3. Punctuation, Number, and Symbol Features. In previous
works [8, 9, 26], features were designed to use the sur-
rounding context in general. However, in order to maximize
the capability of detecting the boundaries of sentences in
text with different genres and domains, we include also the
nonlexical information as features, that concerning the collo-
cation pattern of punctuations, numbers, and symbols. One
of the widely used corpora for evaluation in natural language
processing tasks is the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) corpus. The
WSJ is a typical journalistic news wire corpus. It consists of
speech and narratives marked by double (single) quotes. The
use of dashes and numeral symbols in the corpus is frequent
also.The collocation of those punctuationmarks and symbols
leads to the ambiguities and makes the boundaries detecting
tasks more difficult [27]. Thus, the features that used to
capture this information include 𝑓
7
(𝑤
𝑖
, 𝑤
𝑖+1
), for detecting
the collocation of colon with dash, period, and semicolon:
𝑓
7
(𝑤
𝑖
, 𝑤
𝑖+1
) = {
1 𝑤
𝑖
= colon, 𝑤
𝑖+1
∈ Pdps
0 otherwise,
(7)
where Pdps = {dash, period, semi colon}. The checking of
dollar sign 𝑓
8
(𝑤
𝑖
) and number 𝑓
9
(𝑤
𝑖
) is given by
𝑓
8
(𝑤
𝑖
) = {
1 𝑤
𝑖
= "$"
0 otherwise,
𝑓
9
(𝑤
𝑖
) = {
1 𝑤
𝑖
∈ N
0 otherwise,
(8)
The Scientific World Journal 5
where N is numeric literals. 𝑓
10
(𝑤
𝑖
, 𝑤
𝑖+1
) describes the
expression of potential punctuations followed by either dash
or left quotation mark:
𝑓
10
(𝑤
𝑖
, 𝑤
𝑖+1
) = {
1 𝑤
𝑖
∈ P∗, 𝑤
𝑖+1
∈ Pdq
0 otherwise.
(9)
P∗ is the potential punctuations that signal the boundaries of
sentences, andPdq = {dash, left quote}. 𝑓11(𝑤𝑖, 𝑤𝑖+1), on the
other hand, denotes the expression that excludes left quote
which immediately follows the boundary terminalP∗ and is
defined as
𝑓
11
(𝑤
𝑖
, 𝑤
𝑖+1
) = {
1 𝑤
𝑖
∈ P∗, 𝑤
𝑖+1
̸=P
𝑞
0 otherwise,
(10)
whereP
𝑞
= left quote.
4.4. Data Representation. In preparation, the corpora used
for training and testing themodel are transformed by labeling
the potential sentence boundaries with Y and N to indicate
the true and false boundaries, respectively, as shown in Box 1.
Instead of feeding the list of sentences into the proposed
system directly, the features of potential punctuation are
translated as an instance and described in a format of vector
⟨𝑏
1
, 𝑏
2
, . . . , 𝑏
11
, 𝑙⟩, where 𝑙 is the label (Y/N) representing if it
is the sentence boundary indicator or not. Box 2 shows the
examples of instances construed based on potential trigram
contexts.
5. Evaluations
5.1. Metrics. In order to evaluate the performance of our
proposed system, we employ two state-of-the-art sen-
tence boundary detection systems, Punkt (we use the
Python version of Punkt provided by the NLTK package
(http://www.nltk.org/)) andMaxEnt (it is an implementation
of MxTerminator released by Apache OpenNLP package
(http://opennlp.apache.org/)), with highest results reported
in the literature, for comparison.We treat them as the bench-
marks and evaluate iSentenizer-𝜇 against these standards. For
the performance measure, there are several metrics proposed
to evaluate the detection performance of a BSD system. This
includes the error rate, 𝐹-Score, ROC curve, PR curve, and
DET curve [28, 29]. Basically, all of thosemetrics interpret the
measure based on the counting of true and false positives and
true and false negatives, as denoted in the confusion matrix
(Table 2).
In this study, instead of measuring the error rate as in
[8], we prefer to use the harmonic mean of precision and
recall; besides, due to its popularity [18, 27], precision and
recall can provide us with better information on what kinds
of errors that our system made. Let 𝑇

the number of boundaries in the test data which the system
has correctly detected, let 𝐹

of boundaries in the test data which the system has missed,

system misdetects as the boundaries of sentences, and let

5.2. Corpora Description. In order to verify if the proposed
system is robust and adaptable to varieties of languages and
text genres. We have evaluated the iSentenizer-𝜇 system on
the following corpora.
5.2.1. Brown Corpus and Wall Street Journal (WSJ). Both are
part of the Penn Treebank [30]. They are normally used
for evaluating the SBD tasks. The Brown corpus in general
English and consists of 15 subcorpora of different genres and
6 The Scientific World Journal
topics, ranging from news wires and scientific contents to
fiction and transcribed speech.Altogether there are about 500
documents.TheWSJ corpus is composed of journalistic news
wires and is rich in abbreviations and proper names. There
are about 2,500 articles. Documents in these corpora are
organized in paragraphs and split into sentences. Sentences
are further tokenized into words and annotated with part of
speech (POS) information. However, we do not make use
of this additional annotation information [27] to support
the SBD but extract all necessary data from the splitting
sentences.
5.2.2. The Tycho Brahe Corpus. This is a parsed corpus of
historical Portuguese [31]. It contains 52 articles, about 20,000
sentences, distributed by the Institute of Mathematics and
Statistics of the University of São Paulo. The sentences are
manually tagged with POS and syntactic features at the
University of Campinas in the lines of the Penn-Helsinki
Parse Corpus of Middle English [32]. This corpus represents
quite different text genres from others as the articles were
written by authors between 14th and 19th centuries. We
include this in the evaluation as we want to investigate how
well our system performed on the corpus.
5.2.3. Europarl Corpus. This is a parallel corpus of text in 11
languages of the European Union: Danish (da), German (de),
Greek (el), English (en), Spanish (es), Finnish (fi), French
(fr), Italian (it), Dutch (nl), Portuguese (pt), and Swedish
(sv). The Europarl represents the spoken proceedings of the
European Parliament over a decade. The corpus is originally
created for the research of statistical machine translation
systems [13]. This corpus is very large, and its size is over
30 million words (around 1 million sentences) for each of
the languages. However, we use only part of them for the
evaluation.This corpus provides us with an ideal resource for
evaluating the performance of our BSD system on the cross
domains (multilingual) data.
The relative data size of each of the used corpora both for
training and testing the candidate systems is given in Tables
4 and 5. The test data is held back as unseen samples and is
excluded from the training set, which is 10% of its original
data.
5.3. Features Evaluation. As discussed in Section 4, recogni-
tion of abbreviations plays an important role in the SBD task
[6]. Majority of the ambiguities are caused by the abbrevi-
ations, and it can be greatly reduced if those abbreviations
are identified. In order to boost the performance of SBD
systems, Mikheev [8] and Kiss and Strunk [18] used a list
of abbreviations as additional resources that were extracted
either by hand from general-purpose dictionaries or auto-
matically from the corpus. In this study instead of using the
enumerated abbreviation list, we specifically constructed an
extra feature𝑓
12
(𝑤
𝑖−1
, 𝑤
𝑖
, 𝑤
𝑖+1
) to maximize the performance
of ourmodel.This feature is defined as an embedded classifier
within the model:
𝑓
12
(𝑤
𝑖−1
, 𝑤
𝑖
, 𝑤
𝑖+1
) = 𝐶 (⟨𝑓
󸀠
1
, 𝑓
󸀠
2
, . . . , 𝑓
󸀠
𝑘
⟩) , (14)
Table 3: Number of abbreviations in corpora.
Corpus Number ofabbreviations (train)
Number of
abbreviations (test)
WSJ corpus 27,960 3,110
Brown corpus 644 158
Tycho Brahe corpus 382 8
where𝐶(⋅) is a binary class classifier and𝑓󸀠 is a vector feature.
It returns 1 if the potential candidate is an abbreviation
indicator; otherwise 0 is returned. Theoretically, this extra
local feature set 𝑓󸀠 can be embedded as part of the global
feature set 𝑓, and let the model learn from the training
data. In this study, another classifier is constructed under the
same learning framework to pregenerate the feature values.
To evaluate the effectiveness of the designed features, the
following models are created:
(i) baseline: the model is constructed using the features
described in Section 4; that is, 𝑓
1
∼𝑓
11
;
(ii) iSentenizer-𝜇: the model includes also the twelfth
feature in training; that is, 𝑓
1
∼𝑓
12
.
The number of abbreviations in different corpora is given
in Table 3. Compared with the Brown and Tycho Brahe
corpus, the WSJ corpus has rich abbreviations and proper
nouns.This certainly presents a challenge for the SBDmodels.
The twomodels are trained and evaluated on theWSJ, Brown,
and Tycho Brahe corpus, respectively. The evaluation results
of the models are shown in Tables 7 and 8. We found that the
enhancedmodel iSentenizer-𝜇 gives around 1% improvement
in both the recall and precision and 𝐹-Score, while there
are very little and no improvement at all on the Brown
and Tycho Brahe corpus. It is not surprising that even the
baseline model has achieved a very good performance (𝐹-
Score: 97.86%). When we look at the classification error of
the abbreviations, as demonstrated in Table 9, we found that
there are significant error reductions of 94% and 67% on test
data of the WSJ and Tycho Brahe corpus, respectively. This
proves the effectiveness of the proposed feature set. On the
subsequent experiments, proposedmodelwill be trainedwith
these optimized features.
5.4. Standard Systems. The results presented in the previous
section illustrate that iSentenizer-𝜇 is able to achieve a very
good performance on corpora from different domains and
topics. In this section, we want to compare the performance
of it to that of the state-of-the-art SBD systems, that is, Punkt
and MxTerminator, which have the highest results reported
in the literature.
5.4.1. Punkt. It is an unsupervised SBD model proposed
by Kiss and Strunk [18]. They characterize abbreviations as
collocations and employ the log-likelihood ratios (log 𝜆) to
detect abbreviations, initials, and ordinal numbers in terms of
global evidence (type-based) and local context (token-based).
The system does not rely on orthographic information and
heuristic clues.

5.4.2. MxTerminator. This model, proposed by Reynar and
Ratnaparkhi [9], is constructed based on maximum entropy.
The model learns the contextual features from annotated
corpora. It uses features such as the tokens preceding and
following a potential sentence boundary, and capitalization
information, as well as the affixes of induced abbreviations
from the training corpus.
5.5. Multilingual and Multidomain Evaluation. In this exper-
iment, we train the iSentenizer-𝜇 using the optimized fea-
ture set, while the training of Punkt and MxTerminator is
performed using the default settings. All the models are
trained on the corpora described in Tables 4 and 5. There
covers the text in eleven languages and four kinds of text
genres (WSJ, Brown, Tycho Brahe, and Europarl). The results
achieved on different corpora are given in Tables 6 and 10.
The experiments show that iSentenizer-𝜇 outperforms the
other systems on every corpus. It achieves the best 𝐹-Scores.
Although the precisions of iSentenizer-𝜇 on the Tycho Brahe
(−0.11%) and Danish Europarl (−1.25%) corpora are slightly
lower than that of the MxTerminator, the recalls are much
higher, +19.57% and +63.36%, respectively. It is surprising to
note that both the MxTerminator and Punkt models obtain
unexpected low scores on WSJ corpus. The results are quite
different from their reports. The main reason is that the
current models do not provide any additional abbreviation
list, and it is known that the WSJ corpus is richer with
abbreviations and proper nouns.
5.6. Cross Corpora Evaluation. In the previous section, the
results show that iSentenizer-𝜇 is able to achieve a good
performance on several corpora. In this second part of
Table 6: Performance of systems on different languages of Europarl
corpus.

Three different cross corpora evaluations are carried out; (1)
we train the systems on the (English) Brown corpus, and
test them on the (Portuguese) Tycho Brahe corpus; (2) the
experiment is repeated by training the three SBD systems on
the Tycho Brahe corpus and testing them on Brown corpus.
The results presented in Tables 11 and 12 clearly show that
the overall performance (𝐹-Score) of the proposed system
is always better than the benchmark SBD systems on both
settings; and (3) both the iSentenizer-𝜇 and standard systems
are trained on themixture of Europarl corpora (training data)
covering 11 languages [13] and evaluated on the test data
of those corpora. Once again, the result demonstrates that
iSentenizer-𝜇 can achieve a very good performance (𝐹-Score:
97.47%) in detecting the boundaries of sentences from a high
variety of text domains, as shown in Table 13.
5.7. Incremental Learning Evaluation. For the third part of the
experiment, according to the nature of proposed approach,
iSentenizer-𝜇 is adaptable to the shifts of text genres and new
domains by incrementally learning the new instances that
have not been seen in the training data. Considering that
it is unable to compare against the benchmark systems, in
setting up the experiment, we evaluate the iSententizer- on
different corpora. The experiment is conducted as follows:
(1) the iSentenizer-𝜇 is trained on English data and evaluated
on Danish data of the Europarl corpus (iSent E∧D); (2)
falsely classified instances are collected and ask iSentenizer-
𝜇 to learn the new data on the fly and test again on the
Danish data (iSent E+D∧D); (3) the process is continued
on the German data of the Europarl corpus, namely, testing
on German data (iSent E+D∧G) and evaluating again after
learning the false data (iSent E+D+G∧G). As shown in
Table 14, the results are very promising. They give around
4% to 8% improvement in precision and 2% in 𝐹-Score. The
experiments fully demonstrate that the proposed system is

6. Conclusions
In this work, we have presented a multilingual sentence
boundary detection system (iSentenizer-𝜇) for Danish, Ger-
man, English, Spanish, Dutch, French, Italian, Portuguese,
Greek, Finnish, and Swedish. Different from the related SBD
approaches, iSentenizer-𝜇 is proposed based on the incre-
mental tree learning algorithm, which allows the detection
system to be adaptable across different corpora by easily
incorporating the new data into the model dynamically.
The model does not rely on orthographic information. In
addition, we further introduce an embedded feature set for
detecting abbreviations, one of the most important subtasks
of sentence boundary disambiguation. The experimental
results reveal that the iSentenizer-𝜇 outperforms two state-of-
the-art boundary detection systems used for comparison.The
iSentenizer-𝜇 system (online and offline version) is available
at http://nlp2ct.cis.umac.mo/views/utility.html.
