ABSTRACT 
In recent years, the sentiment analysis on data messages from 
social networks has attracted high attention of researchers. 
However, most of their works have been focused on classifying 
user messages to positive (or like) and negative (or dislike) on 
social issues or discussion topics. In addition, they usually only 
worked with English messages from a single data source, or a 
domain. In this paper, we proposed a crossed-domain sentiment 
analysis system for the discovery of current careers from social 
networks. The proposed system can capture sentiment of career-
related messages from two famous social networks, including 
Twitter and Facebook. The experimental results clearly pointed 
out that the most favorite careers which enjoy the highest 
positive sentiment and the least favorite careers that have the 
highest negative sentiment. The performance results of the 
proposed system are promising for crossed-domain sentiment 
analysis, with the precision of over 85% and the recall of over 
90%.

1. INTRODUCTION 
As the recently fast growth of social networks, such as Facebook 
and Twitter, hundreds of millions of users have joined social 
networks [19] and daily discuss current trends and share their 
personal ideas on various topics. Therefore, social networks have 
been becoming rich data sources for collecting public opinions on 
many social issues. This trend has also happened in Vietnam, 
where its population is young and its number of social network 
users has been double in last 12 months [9]. 
A number of sentiment analysis approaches have been proposed 
to analyze sentiments on data messages from Twitter or 
Facebook [3, 4, 8, 10, 20, 21, 22, 23]. The paper in [20] focused 
on using data messages from Twitter, the most popular micro-
blogging platform, for sentiment analysis. It described how to 
automatically collect a corpus for sentiment analysis and opinion 
mining purposes. Using the corpus, it built a sentiment classifier 
that is able to determine positive, or negative, or neutral 
sentiments for documents. However, the proposed system only 
worked with English messages. On the other hand, Ahkter et all 
[23] used Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt) method to classify 
Facebook status messages in English. It is reported that the 
accuracy of the proposed method is 85%. Although the proposed 
approaches have achieved good results, most of them only 
worked with English messages from a single data source, either 
Facebook or Twitter. 
In this paper, we focus on the crossed-domain sentiment analysis 
of career-related Vietnamese messages from two famous social 
networks, including Twitter and Facebook. In our approach, we 
first collect a set of listed careers and their initial words from a 
job search website. Next, for each career, initial career words 
have been expanded to its complete career keywords using a list 
of career-related topics generated by the LDA method [1] from 
news articles published by online Vietnamese local newspapers. 
Then, data messages which are collected from Twitter and 
Facebook based on the collected career keywords, are used for 
the crossed-domain sentiment analysis. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 presents 
the architecture of the proposed system and Section 3 describes 
the process of extracting career keywords. Section 4 presents our 
approach for crossed-domain the sentiment analysis on the data 
from social networks and Section 5 shows our experiments and 
results. Finally, Section 6 is our conclusion. 
2. ARCHITECTURE OF THE PROPOSED 
SYSTEM 
The architecture of the proposed system is presented in Figure 1. 
The proposed system's processing flow consists of two stages: (1) 
constructing a list of careers with attached job/career keywords 
and (2) collecting the data messages from Twitter and Facebook

based on results of the first stage, and then carrying out the 
crossed-domain sentiment analysis of collected data messages. 
In the first stage, daily published news articles are collected from 
online local news websites, including VnExpress.net, 
Dantri.com.vn, Laodong.com.vn, Vietnamnet.vn and Kenh14.vn. 
Then, news headlines and summaries are extracted from news 
articles and then they are clustered by the LDA model [1] to 
produce a list of K topics and their corresponding keywords. We 
only use news headlines and summaries because they represent 
the main ideas of the news articles. Next, a list of T careers with 
initial keywords is extracted from a job search website, such as 
Vieclam.24h.com.vn, or VietnamWorks.com. In order to expand 
the job keywords of each career, a career's initial words are 
matched against each topic of K topics generated LDA model. If 
a match is found the topic's keywords are merged into career's job 
keywords. The first stage's result is a list of T careers with job 
keywords which are used as the input for the second stage. 
 
Figure 1. Proposed system architecture 
In the second stage, the system explores public opinions by 
carrying out the sentiment analysis on messages from Twitter and 
Facebook. Firstly, we use the Twitter API ver. 1.1 [3][13] and the 
Facebook graph API [5][6][15] to collect career-related messages 
for opinion mining. For each career in the list of current careers, 
data messages are collected based on the career's keywords. 
Secondly, two machine learning algorithms, SVM [7] and 
MaxEnt [2] are used consecutively to estimate the sentiment 
polarity of collected messages for each career. 
3. EXTRACTING THE CAREER 
KEYWORDS 
3.1 LDA model (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) 
LDA model [1] is a generative model originally proposed for 
topic modeling. In LDA, the data is in the form of a collection of 
documents, in which each document is considered as a collection 
of words. It is assumed that each document is represented as a 
random mixture of latent topics, and each topic is represented as 
a distribution over words. These mixture distributions are 
assumed to be Dirichlet-distributed random variables which must 
be inferred from the data. 
Given a corpus of M documents denoted by D = {d1, d2, …, dM}, 
in which each document m in the corpus consists of Nm words, 
each word wi drawn from a vocabulary of terms {t1, t2, …, tv}. 
The goal of LDA is to find the latent structure of “topics” or 
“concepts” which capture the meaning of text that is obscured by 
“word choice” noise. LDA is a complete generative model that 
has shown better results than the earlier approaches [1]. 
Considering the LDA's graphical model representation shown in 
Figure 2, the generative process can be interpreted as follows: 
First, LDA generates a stream of observable words wm,n, 
partitioned into documents . 
 
Figure 2. LDA's graphical model representation 
Then, for each of these documents, a topic proportion  is 
drawn, and from which, topic-specific words are emitted. That is, 
for each word, a topic indicator zm,n is sampled according to the 
document – specific mixture proportion, and then the 
corresponding topic-specific term distribution  is used to 
draw a word. The mixture component of topic k  is sampled 
one time for the entire corpus. The complete (annotated) 
generative model is presented in Algorithm 1 and Figure 3 gives 
a list of involved notations.

In our work, we use JGibbLDA [12] which is a Java 
implementation of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) using the 
Gibbs Sampling technique for the parameter estimation and 
inference. The input of the LDA model is a list of news headlines 
and summaries collected from online local news website and its 
output is a list of K topics and their corresponding keywords. 
3.2 Collecting the career list and initial words 
In order to collect the list of careers and their initial words, we 
first manually search and collect a list of careers from job search 
websites, such as Vieclam.24h.com.vn and VietnamWorks.com. 
Each career is represented by a word or a phrase of words, such 
as  IT-Software, Customer Service, Marketing, 
Education/Training, etc. Totally, 22 careers are collected. 
Then, we extract initial career words for each career from the 
career description based on the bag of words model. For each 
career, only words that have the highest probability are collected. 
For example, words and phrases such as programming, 
development, game, large scale system, client and server and 
web are extracted from the IT & Technology career. We only 
take the top thirty words in each career as initial words. Figure 4 
shows the example of extracting initial words for the IT & 
Technology career.

career 
3.3 Generating career keywords 
We generate career keywords for the sentiment analysis by 
expanding initial career words using topics and their keywords of 
online news articles, which are generated by LDA model 
described in Section 3.1. We assume that there are fixed K topics 
in M documents (each document includes a news headline and a 
summary) with N terms. We collected news headlines and 
summaries from online local news websites, including 
VnExpress.net, Dantri.com.vn, Laodong.com.vn, Vietnamnet.vn 
and Kenh14.vn in 6 days, from April 22, 2014 to April 27, 2014 
for processing. Table 1 shows an example of headlines of news 
articles for clustering using LDA model. For each generated 
topic, we set a limit of 40 words. 
Table 1. Sample articles with high probability  
in career topics 
 
Algorithm 2 is used to generate career keywords by expanding 
initial career words using topics and their keywords created 
using LDA model. The algorithm accepts the input of the set of 
K topics and the set of T careers and then outputs the list of 
career keywords for each specific career. 
Algorithm 2: Generating the career keywords 
Input: Set of K topics T={t1,t2,…,tK} 
             Each tj (j=1,K) has tj= {w1,w2,…,w40} (set of topic words) 
             Set of T careers  C={c1,c2,…,cT} 
             Each ci (i=1,T) has ci= {w1,w2,…,w30} (set of initial words) 
 Output: Set of T careers C’ = {c’1,c’2,…,c’T} 
               Each c’i (i=1,T) has Li (set of career keywords) 
      for all ci in C 
          c’i = ci 
          Li = ci

4. SENTIMENT ANALYSIS ON SOCIAL 
NETWORKS 
4.1 Social network dataset for classification 
For the crossed-domain sentiment analysis, we collect the data 
messages based on the generated career keywords from two 
famous social networks, including Twitter and Facebook. Twitter 
is an online social network and micro-blogging service that 
enables its users to send and read short messages, known as 
tweets. The limit length of each tweet is 140 characters. Twitter 
offers a special orthography that includes special features, hash-
tags, user mentions, retweets and emotions. Two types of 
application programming interfaces [13] are available for 
external applications to communicate with Twitter. The REST 
API provides a simple interface to Twitter functionalities, and 
the Streaming API is a powerful real-time API. However, the 
access to the public data of Twitter is limited using both API 
interfaces. 
The keyword filtering is provided by the Twitter Streaming API 
which allows to only collect keyword-related messages. A list of 
terms can be passed as a parameter to the Twitter Streaming API. 
Then only tweets which contain an element of the term list are 
included in the output data stream. The size of term list is 
limited to a maximum of 400 terms. 
Twitter is used all over the world and the posted messages can 
be in any language. Sentiment analysis makes use of language 
specific content and therefore the language plays an important 
role. In our work we assume that all collected tweets are 
Vietnamese (using the language filter, language=“vi”). Because 
of the limited message size and the freedom in composing, 
incorrectly formatted tweets are contained in the dataset. To get a 
cleaner dataset for training, message cleansing techniques are 
applied. Different filters are applied in sequence in the 
experiments. The first step is keyword filtering since only 
messages in the defined domain are processed. The next step is 
to filter Twitter special features: "RT", "#"-hashtags, "@user"-
mentions, emoticons and URLs. The last step is filtering the 
overuse of letters or punctuations (dots, question and 
exclamation marks) and stop-words [14]. 
Facebook is a social network service and a website launched in 
February 2004. Facebook allows users to create profiles for 
themselves, upload photographs and videos. Users can view 
profiles of other users who are added as their friends and they 
can also exchange text messages. The Graph API [15] is the 
primary way to put data in and get data out of Facebook. Most 
API calls must be signed with an access token [15]. The 
Facebook Query Language, or FQL, enables developers to use an 
SQL-style interface to query the data exposed by the Graph API. 
It provides advanced features that are not available in the Graph 
API. FQL can handle simple math and basic logical operators, 
and ORDER BY and LIMIT clauses. ORDER BY clause only 
supports a single table. In our work, we use one named stream 
table (FQL stream table retrieves all the posts of a specific user 
containing tags) [5, 6]. 
4.2 Sentiment analysis of messages 
We implemented two machine learning algorithms, including 
SVM [16] and MaxEnt [17] consecutively for the sentiment 
classification of Vietnamese messages. The dataset of 
Vietnamese messages is collected from Twitter and Facebook 
and pre-processed as described in Section 4.1. The dataset can 
contain positive, negative, neutral messages or irrelevant 
messages which are unlabeled data. Both SVM and MaxEnt 
models are supervised learning methods so they require a set of 
labeled data. We selected a small part of the dataset and labeled 
it manually. The labeled data is used as the input for both SVM 
and MaxEnt models. 
We first use the SVM model to classify the collected messages 
into two classes. The first class contains messages, each of which 
can be either positive or negative sentiment related to careers. 
The other class contains messages which have no sentiment 
related to careers. This class is named neutral sentiment. Next, 
we use the MaxEnt model to classify the positive and negative 
sentiment messages generated by SVM model into two classes of 
positive and negative. 
5. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS 
In this section, we examine the overall effectiveness of the 
proposed system. First, we extracted a list of careers and initial 
career words from Vieclam.24h.com.vn job website [11]. Then, 
we captured topics of news articles of 5 online local news 
websites, including VnExpress.net, Dantri.com.vn, 
Laodong.com.vn, Vietnamnet.vn and Kenh14.vn. A self-built 
corpus is collected in the period from April 22, 2014 to April 27, 
2014 using jsoup (http://jsoup.org). Totally, we collected 40268 
news articles for processing. Table 1 shows an example of the 
headlines of newspaper articles. Each headline of an article is 
used only once so the number of articles remained 40268 for 
extracting features. After that stop-words are removed from the 
data for clustering. Then, JGibbLDA [11] - a tool for Latent 
Dirichlet Allocation using Gibbs Sampling is used to cluster 
topics based on LDA model. In the hidden topic mining phrase, 
the number of topics, K, was set at 400. The hyper-parameters α 
and β were set at 0.25 and 0.1 respectively. The number of Gibbs 
sampling iterations N=1000. The step counted by the number of 
Gibbs sampling iterations is saved to hard disk as save-step = 
100. The number of words for each topic is set to 40. After 
combining the initial career words with the topic keywords we 
get the list of career keywords for each specific career. Table 2 
shows the top 10 keywords in each career and Table 3 shows the 
number of articles by careers.

All the career keywords of 22 careers are formed a list of terms, 
which is passed as a parameter to the Twitter streaming API and 
the Facebook graph API to get the career-related messages. The 
collected corpus consists of 195674 messages in the period from 
April 2, 2014 until May 22, 2014. After being filtered non-
Vietnamese messages out and pre-processed, the corpus contains 
119138 messages. 
For the sentiment analysis, we use SVM and MaxEnt models as 
described in Section 4.2. Table 4 shows the distribution of the 
three classes of positive, negative and neutral for each career. 
The distribution shows that over 50 percent of the messages are 
neutral on average.

Figure 5 shows the number of positive and negative messages by 
career. While careers, including IT-Software, Mechanical, IT-
Hardware/networking, Customer service, Sales and Human 
resources enjoy the highest positive sentiment, the Accounting 
career has the highest negative sentiment. On the other view of 
the results, Figure 6 shows ratio of positive to negative sentiment 
for each career.

To validate the classification results using the SVM model, we 
took a random sample of 1000 messages from the results (about 
10% of the results) and manually labeled them. The result from 
the manual classification is compared to the result produced by 
SVM model to calculate the performance measures of TS (True 
Sentiment), FS (False Sentiment), TN (True Neutral) and FN 
(False Neutral). TS is the number of messages that are correctly 
classified as either positive or negative sentiment related to 
careers. FS is the number of messages that are incorrectly 
classified as having sentiment (positive or negative) related to 
careers. TN is the number of messages that are correctly 
classified as neutral sentiment. FN is the number of messages 
that are incorrectly classified as neutral sentiment. Table 5 shows 
the performance of SVM classification.

Using the similar method, we verify the performance of the 
MaxEnt model using a random sample of 500 messages from the 
results (also about 10% of the results) and manually labeled 
them. The result from the manual classification is compared to

the result produced by MaxEnt model to calculate the 
performance measures of TP (True Positive), FP (False Positive), 
TN (True Negative) and FN (False Negative). Table 6 shows the

6. CONCLUSION 
In this paper, we have presented a crossed-domain sentiment 
analysis system that can capture sentiment of career-related 
messages from two famous social networks, including Twitter 
and Facebook. The experimental results clearly show the most 
favorite careers of IT-Software, Mechanical, IT-
Hardware/networking, Customer service, Sales and Human 
resources, which enjoy the highest positive sentiment. On the 
other side, the Accounting career is the least favorite with the 
highest negative sentiment. The performance results of the 
proposed system are good with the precision of over 85% and 
recall of over 90%. This is a promising result for crossed-domain 
sentiment analysis. 
In the future, we will conduct extensive experiments on larger 
datasets to verify the performance of the proposed system. 
Furthermore, we will expand our work on crossed-domain 
sentiment analysis by adding more domains and using results 
from one domain to training process of other domains to reduce 
the amount of required labeled data.
