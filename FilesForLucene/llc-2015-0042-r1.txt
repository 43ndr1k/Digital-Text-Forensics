Abstract 
Pliny the Younger's letter to Trajan regarding the Christians is a crucial subject for the studies 
on early Christianity. A serious quarrel among scholars concerning its genuineness arose 
between the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th; per contra, Plinian 
authorship has not been seriously questioned in the last few decades. After analysing various 
kinds of internal and external evidence in favour of and against the authenticity of the letter, a 
modern stylometric method is applied in order to examine whether internal linguistic 
evidence allows one to definitely settle the debate.  
The findings of this analysis tend to contradict received opinion among modern scholars 
affirming the authenticity of Pliny’s letter, and suggest instead the presence of large amounts 
of interpolation inside the text of the letter, since its stylistic behaviour appears highly 
different from that of the rest of Book X.

1. Background 
The historical importance of Pliny the Younger's letter to Trajan regarding the Christians 
(Epistulae X.96), together with the corresponding short answer of the Emperor (Epistulae 
X.97), can hardly be underrated. Pliny’s letter is the first pagan account to refer to Christ and 
Christianity, and provides key information on early Christian practices at the beginning of the 
second century, as well as the attitude of the Roman government towards them. Modern 
scholars (e.g. Van Voorst, 2000, pp. 26–27) largely agree on the authenticity of the letter in 
its entirety and Plinian authorship has not been seriously questioned in the last few decades, 
mainly since the British historian Sherwin-White (Sherwin-White, 1966, p. 691) expressed 
his influential opinion in his outstanding commentary on Pliny’s Letters, claiming that ‘it is 
hardly necessary to defend the genuine character of these two letters. The curious may refer 
to Durry’s summary of that unnecessary controversy.’ In fact, before Sherwin-White, Durry 
(Pliny the Younger, trans. 1947, pp. 69–72), Mayer-Maly (1956, p. 312) and Vidman (1960, 
pp. 87–88), after summarizing the consensus of opinion, decisively stood for the genuineness 
of the two letters. Per contra, the debate concerning the authenticity of these documents 
reached its acme in the period between the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 
20th, chiefly in France, where even scholars of the like of Charles Guignebert (1901, pp. 75–
94) were inclined to admit the spurious nature of some fragments of this letter, radically 
concluding that good critics cannot base their arguments on such a dubious text.  
Hence, is it really time to consider the inquiry having reached the quiet harbor of res 
iudicatae? 
In order to answer this question it is necessary to fix the main issues of the status quaestionis, 
recapitulating both internal and external evidence in favour of and against the authenticity of 
what we will call hereinafter the Plinian Testimonium (PT). This will enable us to introduce 
the contents of this paper and define its aim.

2. External Evidence: Textual Tradition and Patristic Witnesses 
Though no ancient manuscript containing Book X of Pliny’s Letters (including the official 
correspondence between Pliny and the Emperor Trajan) has come down to us, the complex 
but fascinating study of the textual tradition of Book X (e.g. Tuccinardi, 2014) permits us to 
argue that such a manuscript, the famous Parisinus discovered by Joannes Iucundus of 
Verona in Paris, unquestionably existed in the early 16th century. Moreover, the presence of 
at least another manuscript, found by Petrus Leander in Blois (Loire Valley) in the same 
years, partially containing the correspondence with Trajan and different from the Parisinus, 
must be considered a more than plausible possibility (Tuccinardi, 2014, pp. 23–27). 
Consequently it can be argued that no humanist of the 15th or 16th centuries forged PT. Is 
this enough for establishing the Plinian authorship of the disputed letter? Obviously not. 
Actually, Stout (1954, pp. 52–54) proved that the archetype of the 10-book collection, from 
which all our knowledge of Book X is derived, was an elaborately prepared edition of the 
Letters, adding the correspondence with Trajan to the old and well-known corpus of Book I–
IX. The editor completed his work after Pliny’s time, at some time before the end of the fifth 
century (Gibson, 2014, p. 41). Stout was inclined to admit the later date, being the terminus 
ante quem the supposed date of Pierpont Morgan fragment M462 (late fifth), the oldest but 
incomplete manuscript of the 10-book family. The editor of this collection was a competent 
scholar, able to emend the text and to add tables of contents at the start of each book. 
Consequently, Christian additions might have been included in PT some time before the new 
edition of the Plinian corpus was prepared by this learned scholar, himself potentially having 
that literary skill to interpolate Pliny’s letter concerning the Christians. 
Not mentioned by any of the apologists of the second century, a full paraphrase of the Plinian 
correspondence about the Christians comes up in Tertullian's Apologeticum (II, 6–7) at the 
end of the second century.  Tertullian’s account diverges from the narrative of Pliny in some

details. The same report, but quoted from Tertullian (Merrill, 1909), appears again in 
Eusebius (Historia Ecclesiastica III, 33) and Jerome (Chronicon CCXXI Olympias) in the 
fourth century and, at the beginning of the fifth century and with greater inaccuracies, in 
Orosius (Historiarum Adversum Paganos, VII, 12) and Sulpicius Severus (Chronicorum 
Libri duo, II, 31). Is Tertullian’s testimony a guarantee for the trustworthiness of PT? It is 
well known that Tertullian, in the same work (Apologeticum, V, 2), mentions an alleged 
report of Pilate to Tiberius from Palestine testifying events clearly showing ‘the truth of 
Christ's divinity’, a legend which, later, originated the spurious fourth century document 
known as Acta Pilati. But, above all, yet in the Apologeticum (V, 6), Tertullian cites letters of 
Marcus Aurelius where ‘he bears his testimony that Germanic drought was removed by the 
rains obtained through the prayers of the Christians who chanced to be fighting under him.’ 
The Rain Miracle of Marcus Aurelius, occurring during his German-Sarmatian wars between 
171 and 174 AD, inspired the Christian tradition mentioned by Tertullian. A pagan legend, 
alleged by Cassius Dio (Roman History, 71.8) and also represented in a famous scene on 
Marcus’ column at Piazza Colonna in Rome, was converted into a Christian tale after less 
than 30 years. Moreover, in the fourth century, a Marcus Aurelius letter of the kind of the one 
mentioned by Tertullian was forged by some Christian, probably on the basis of Dio’s report 
not yet tampered with by the monk Xiphilinus (Kovács, 2009, pp. 113–121). Consequently, 
as the abovementioned cases show, it would be reckless to base the authenticity of PT on 
Tertullian’s testimony, excluding a priori the possibility that a supposed forger could have 
altered a letter originally written by Pliny. 
3. Internal Evidence: Historical Consistency and Stylistic Features 
It is admissible to doubt of the genuineness of Pliny’s letter concerning the Christians if the 
text, submitted to critical analysis, reveals historical incongruences and presents itself in a 
way unlikely to be written by a Roman magistrate in the second century. Besides, the letter

should contain interpolations and cuts altering the coherence of the narrative development 
and betraying the apologetic or hagiographic aim of the forger. Is this the case for PT? A 
subject of contention among the scholars, at least till the early 20th, it is not the aim of this 
work to reproduce their main arguments. Notwithstanding this, it is worth to emphasize that, 
in order to judge the historical consistency of PT, it is necessary to have suitable tools. This 
means having an adequate knowledge of the Christian embryo inside the Roman world at the 
beginning of the second century. Unfortunately, Pliny’s letter about the Christians is not only 
the most ancient pagan source able to enlighten this shadow cone, but also the most 
important. Hence, risk of unconscious self-referentiality is behind the corner, a danger that 
the use of early Christian writings is not able to circumvent. 
Dealing with the stylistic features of PT allows us to move to more solid ground. The stylistic 
peculiarity of Book X facing the corpus of Book I–IX had long since been acknowledged. 
Pliny himself defines the letters required of him by his office inlitteratissimae litterae 
(Epistulae I.10), letters of the same kind as those included in Book X. An exhaustive analysis 
has been carried out by Gamberini (1983, pp. 332–376) demonstrating that, in comparison 
with Books I–IX, Book X is characterized by a lack of figures of speech and that its letters 
point up a complex hypotactic structure instead of the parataxis and brevity typical of the first 
nine books. The strongest rebuttal against the deniers of Plinian authorship of the letter 
concerning the Christians arrived precisely on stylistic grounds. First Mayor (1890, pp. 121–
122) then Linck (1913, pp. 43–44), extracting a list of terms and expressions from the 
disputed letter, proved through the comparison with other letters written by Pliny, and 
especially those of Book X, that they are instead characteristic of Pliny. After their 
philological analyses, it became very hard to suppose a forger having that amazing skill 
necessary to construct ex novo the letter and, consequently, it would seem impossible that a 
Christian forger could ‘imitate so precisely the language and style of Pliny’ (Clavelle, 1971,

p. 21). But what about the hypothesis regarding the presence of Christian interpolations in a 
letter originally written by Pliny? Of course, the critical analysis carried out by the 
abovementioned scholars could not be cogent and valuable for the entire text of PT and, it is 
not a coincidence if – in the wake of Guignebert (1901) – Ranovic (1949), Herrmann (1954) 
and Sokolov (1956) carried on suspecting the presence of Christian additions, more or less 
important, altering the original text of the letter. One of the arguments supporting this thesis 
is the unusual length of the disputed letter, as even Sherwin-White (1966, p. 691), while 
considering improbable Herrmann’s attempt, is disposed to admit.  
The main aim of the present paper is to weigh the linguistic evidence for and against Pliny's 
authorship of his letter concerning the Christians in an objective manner, using a recently 
available stylometric technique. This will allow us to verify whether the language of PT is, in 
its entirety, actually characteristic of Pliny or not. 
4. Stylometry: a Profile-based Approach for Authorship Verification  
Stylometry is the study of the linguistic characteristics carried out in order to determine 
authorship. Its crucial assumption is that each author owns distinctive writing habits, 
independent of his/her will, and since the author cannot intentionally alter these features, they 
provide the most reliable data for an objective stylistic inquiry.  Large quantities of stylistic 
features (lexical, syntactic, structural, etc.) have been identified and exploited as style 
markers in authorship attribution. The most successful and robust methods are achieved by 
processing style markers such as function words or character n-grams (consecutive sequences 
of n characters) frequencies. More in detail, character n-grams based method is a well suited 
and language-independent approach to represent text for stylistic purposes (e.g. Stamatatos, 
2009), especially when relatively short documents (such as PT) are processed, being the 
dimensionality of this representation considerably increased in comparison to the word-based

approach. Character n-grams are able to catch nuances of style including lexical, syntactical 
and morphological information. 
Authorship verification is an important subfield in authorship analysis and one of the most 
complex tasks in style-based text categorization. Satisfactory results have been achieved only 
in recent years. Given a set of documents by a single author and one document of questioned 
authorship, the problem is to determine whether the questioned document was written by the 
same person who wrote the known document set or not. Stamatatos et al. (2000) first 
analyzed the authorship verification task but it was with Koppel et al. (2007) and the 
unmasking method that important outcomes were attained. Applying unmasking to books 
gives exceptional results but not as much if only short documents are available. Afterwards, 
Koppel and Winter (2011) proposed a new n-grams based approach (the impostors method) 
to determine whether two documents were by the same author. Exploiting documents chosen 
from external sources (the Web), this method gives surprisingly good results even when the 
size of the questioned document is no more than 500 words. Other studies focusing on 
authorship verification for short texts like e-mail messages were carried out by Iqbal et al. 
(2010) and by Chen and Hao (2011).  
Recently very promising results were achieved using two Profile-based methods both 
exploiting n-grams features.  
The first one, proposed by Brocardo et al. (2013), yearns for identifying and keeping only the 
most discriminant features of the authors’ writing habits. In fact the author profile consists of 
all unique n-grams occurring in the related data set. The discriminant criterion to establish if 
two documents are of the same author consists in merging the two author profiles to be 
compared, thus calculating the percentage of unique n-grams shared by the two data sets. A 
text is said to be a genuine sample of an author only if this percentage is above a threshold 
defined during the training phase. The relevant results obtained in an experimental evaluation

based on the Enron e-mail data set, even when short message blocks are analysed (block size 
of 500 and even 250 characters), make this approach promising for important future tasks, 
such as detecting any Christian additions inside the Pliny’s letter about the Christians (see 
Section 5). Further improvements of the performance of this method, also obtained through 
an expansion of the feature set, were carried out in Brocardo et al. (2014). 
The second Profile-based method to solve authorship verification problems, especially where 
imbalanced document sets are compared (such as PT and Book X), was proposed by Potha 
and Stamatatos (2014). The PAN 2013 evaluation lab on authorship identification gave new 
impetus to the studies and Potha and Stamatatos (2014), starting from the results achieved in 
this competition and resting upon the Common N-Grams (CNG) method for authorship 
attribution introduced by Keselj et al. (2003), proposed this new, more efficient method.  
In the CNG method, writing style is exemplified by character n-gram profiles, i.e. each 
document is represented as a bag of character n-grams. Hence, the author profile becomes the 
list of character n-grams with the corresponding frequency of occurrence. Keselj also 
provided a Perl module TEXT::NGRAMS able to process a text file returning all n-gram 
frequencies, sorted in descending order, up to the maximal specified length.  
Accordingly, in the method proposed by Potha and Stamatatos (2014, pp. 316–317) all 
samples of known authorship are concatenated into a single document and a character n-gram 
representation vector is extracted from this large document. This vector represents the known 
author profile. Another vector is then constructed from the questioned document and the two 
vectors are compared using a dissimilarity (or similarity) function. If the resulting score is 
above (or under) a certain threshold, the questioned document is assigned to the author of the 
known document set. 
The effectiveness of the method depends on four parameters, which have to be tuned. The 
first is the order of character n-gram (n). The second is the profile size (s) of the documents

of known authorship (Lk). The third is the profile size of the disputed document (Lu). The last 
one is the choice of the dissimilarity (or similarity) function (d). Actually, experimental 
results (Potha and Stamatatos, 2014) show that on dealing with author profiles with 
unbalanced sizes (i.e. Lk versus Lu), better performance is achieved if the maximum possible 
length of Lu is used. In contrast, from the documents of known authorship, only the most 
frequent character n-grams must be used.  
5. Investigating the Authenticity of the Plinian Testimonium  
In view of the above, the Profile-based method proposed by Potha and Stamatatos (2014) 
appears to be an ideal approach to investigate the genuineness of Pliny’s letter concerning the 
Christians. Actually, the stylometric technique applied in this paper to solve the PT problem 
is largely based on it, being the profile of the disputed document (Lu) extracted from the text 
of PT and the profile of the documents of Plinian authorship (Lk) extracted from Book X 
except for PT. The reliability of this method should also be bolstered by the well-known 
peculiarities of Book X of Pliny’s Letters, making it a corpus stylistically homogenous. 
Conformance in genre, in register (all letters written to the Emperor Trajan) and in time of 
writing – all these highly contribute to its uniformity. 
The discriminatory function chosen in the PT problem is the Simplified Profile Intersection 
(SPI), first used with good results in the Source Code Author Profiling (Frantzeskou et al., 
2006). SPI is a similarity distance given by the size of the intersection of the two profiles (Lk 
and Lu) concretely measured counting the common n-grams between them. Thus only the 
first two parameters remain to be tuned. Leaning on the experimental results obtained by 
Eder (2011) on Latin prose and by Potha and Stamatatos (2014) on the PAN2013 corpora, 
three values of n (n=4, n=5 and n=6) and two values of s (s=500 and s=1000) are tested, 
consequently creating six different models (see Table 1).

The presence of non-Plinian additions in PT might be detected by the low value of the 
similarity function SPI obtained by merging the profiles of the disputed letter with the one of 
Book X, the lower the SPI score the larger the interpolations. But in order to evaluate the SPI 
score, terms of comparisons are required. For attaining this goal, the following operations 
were carried out (see Fig. 1).  
Fig. 1 The proposed approach for authorship verification of PT 
First, all non-Plinian letters (i.e. Trajan’s answers, Domitian’s letter, etc.) were removed from 
Book X. Then Pliny’s letter concerning the Christians (PT) was isolated from Book X, 
thereby originating two texts: PT and BX-PT (i.e. the whole Book X except for Pliny’s letter 
about the Christians). Next, the corpus BX-PT was split into 15 fragments (hereinafter Pi, 
with i varying from 1 to 15), each one approximately of the same size as PT (i.e. 3,000 
characters – see Table 2) and associated with the complementary corpus consisting of BX-Pi 
(i.e. the whole Book X except for fragment Pi). 
Table 2 Fifteen fragments from BX-PT 
For each model and for each Plinian fragment, the couples Lk (Pi) and Lu (BX-Pi) were 
created using the Perl module TEXT::NGRAMS. Thus, since the 15 fragments are of 
acknowledged Plinian authorship, from the SPI values extracted merging Lk (Pi) and Lu (BX-
Pi) and for each model, a list of the typical SPI values for Pliny’s letters of Book X was 
obtained.  On doing so, the required terms of comparisons for the SPI values of PT were 
created (see Table 3). 
Table 3 Normalized SPI values for each model and for each Plinian fragment 
The Q-Q plots of the SPI values (see Fig. 2) suggest that the samples are drawn from a 
normally distributed population.

Because of the small samples size (N=15), the t-distribution (Student’s t-distribution) was 
considered to be more apt than normal distribution in describing the probability properties of 
the SPI arrays.  Actually, t-distribution gives better results than normal distribution whenever 
few number of data point (N<30 in general) are available. Whereas a normal 
distribution describes a full population, t-distributions describe samples drawn from a full 
population normally distributed (different t-distributions for different sample sizes, the larger 
the sample, the more the t-distribution is similar to the normal distribution). Student’s t-
distribution is leptokurtic, consequently, it has higher density in the tails if compared with a 
normal distribution having the same mean and standard deviation (that means that the 
probability of obtaining values very far from the mean is larger than in the normal 
distribution).  
Merging Lk (PT) and Lu (BX-PT), it is possible to obtain – for each model – the resulting SPI 
values for PT (see Table 4). 
Table 4 Normalized SPI values of PT  
After having standardized all the SPI values, exploiting the t-distribution properties of the 
SPI data sets of the Plinian fragments (Pi), it is possible to estimate – for PT – the probability 
that such a text, in its entirety, originally belonged to Pliny’s Book X. Of course, different 
probabilities can be obtained adopting different models (see Fig. 3). 
Fig. 3 Student’s t distribution of SPI values for Pi and PT in the six models 
The first relevant point to be noticed is that, in all the tested models, the SPI value of PT 
always has the lowest value among the Plinian fragments of Book X. Moreover, the 
possibility that a generic Plinian fragment of Book X has an SPI value equal or less than the 
one of PT is, for all six models, lower than 5.0% and, for four models out of six, even less 
than 0.5%. The result is that, regardless of the chosen model and contrary to the consensus of 
opinion, the stylometric analysis seems to suggest the presence of interpolations inside the

text of PT. How large these interpolations would be would depend on the adopted model, 
being 0.5% 10 times lower than 5.0%.  Hence, the question arises: Which is the best model? 
And how should n and s be chosen? In accordance with which criterion? Making some 
simplifications, it is possible to further expand the investigation. 
The best parameters n and s would be those that are able to construct a model having the 
greatest possible discriminatory power. This means finding that model more apt in 
distinguishing the Plinian letters of Book X from other unrelated letters.  
In order to identify the best model, additional fragments of letters from external sources were 
used, approximately having the same size as PT and specifically five samples from Cicero 
(Ad Familiares, I, 1–7) – hereinafter Ci, with i varying from 1 to 5 – and five from Seneca 
(Ad Lucilium, I, 1–6) – hereinafter Si, with i varying from 1 to 5 (see Table 5). 
Table 5 Ten fragments from Cicero and Seneca 
Thus it was possible to calculate the corresponding SPI values, merging both Lk (Ci) and Lk 
(Si) with Lu (BX) – see Table 6.  
Table 6 Normalized SPI values for each model and for each fragment from external source 
A visual confirmation of the stylistic homogeneity of Book X can be appreciated in Fig. 4 
showing the SPI values of the samples from Book X (PT not included) systematically above 
the SPI values of external sources. 
Fig. 4 SPI comparison between Book X except for PT and external sources 
Once again, harnessing the t-distribution properties of the SPI values of Pliny’s 
correspondence with Trajan and aware of the unavoidable limitations of the method (choice 
of the best method depending on the choice of the external authors, by the choice of the 
extracted samples and by their numbers), a simple criterion was used to recognize the model 
having greater discriminating power. For each model the maximum SPI value of the external 
documents (i.e. Ci and Si) was extracted, identifying the best model as the one in which this

maximum SPI value (max-SPI) has the lowest probability to belong to the Plinian 
correspondence with Trajan (see Table 7).  
Table 7 Max SPI values for each model with the corresponding probabilities 
The results of the analysis is that the model having greater discriminatory power is model 3, 
being the probability that the SPI value of the generic Plinian fragment is equal or less than 
the max-SPI lower than 2.0%. A visual comparison between the SPI values of Plinian 
fragments, PT and max-SPI is shown in Fig. 5.  
Fig. 5 SPI comparison between Book X, PT and max-SPI 
For model 3 the possibility that a generic Plinian fragment of Book X has an SPI value equal 
or less than the one of PT is 0.5%, an impressively low probability. The unrelatedness of PT 
among the other Plinian fragments of Book X can be fully appreciated in Fig. 6, representing, 
in the t-distribution diagram of model 3, the SPI values of all the textual fragments 
considered.

5. Conclusions  
The findings of this analysis tend to contradict received opinion among modern scholars 
affirming the authenticity of Pliny’s letter concerning the Christians. On the contrary, the 
results achieved with a Profile-based method for authorship verification suggest the presence 
of a large amount of interpolation inside the text of the letter, as the stylistic behaviour of the 
Plinian Testimonium appears highly different from the one of the rest of Book X. Moreover, 
external evidence on Pliny’s letter about the Christians is not currently able to dismiss a 
conclusion strongly based on stylistic grounds. Future works on this subject would include 
testing the authenticity of Pliny’s letter by different reliable methods (e.g. Brocardo et al., 
2013 and Brocardo et al., 2014) and/or by the same method but using different similarity 
functions. Owing to the serious historical implications of the outcome of this study, an

important future objective would be to detect any Christian additions inside Pliny’s text. This 
challenging task may not be a Chimera, if one considers the very promising results obtained 
by recent studies in authorship verification for very short messages (Brocardo et al., 2013 and 
Brocardo et al., 2014). Not overlooking the traditional tools made available by the historical-
critical method, it seems imperative for future studies to take on this new challenge by 
harnessing recent stylometric tools.
