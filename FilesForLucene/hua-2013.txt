Abstract. Existing researches on text plagiarism detection mainly focus on ex-
ternal plagiarism detection which assumes a reference collection is given and the 
plagiarism detection task aims to compare suspicious documents against this 
collection to find the plagiarism articles with high similarity. The results of ex-
isting studies have performed well in identifying external plagiarized sections. 
However, in the real world, the reference collection is impossible to get. This 
paper focuses on this case and proposes an intrinsic plagiarism detection 
framework with supervised machine learning approach. The instance creation 
and the feature selection method are presented in detail. The experimental results 
on PAN’09 corpus demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach to intrinsic 
plagiarism. 
Keywords: text plagiarism, intrinsic plagiarism detection, supervised learning, 
feature selection. 
1 Introduction 
The development of the Internet makes information sharing more and more rifeness, 
which helps people obtain information conveniently and provides an opportunity to 
plagiarize. Existing researches on text plagiarism detection always aim to compare 
suspicious documents against the paper collection to find the plagiarism article with 
high similarity. For example, the detection method for approximate copy has been 
studied intensively by Hoad [1]. Finkel [2] proposed an adjustable indicator of ap-
proximate plagiarism detection. Different from above, we assume that copy detection 
for the text in the premise of the paper collection can’t get in advance and call this copy 
detection as the intrinsic plagiarism detection. 
This paper’s contribution is that it proposed an intrinsic plagiarism detection 
framework with supervised learning approach. In this framework, firstly we use the 
inconsistency between intrinsic plagiarism segments and whole article, then we learn 
the style model of article segment effectively to construct a classification model, finally 
we identify plagiarism segment.  
2 Related Work 
Some researchers have put forward intrinsic text plagiarism detection methods and 
achieved good achievements in recent years. But most researchers used the unsupervised 
 Research on Intrinsic Plagiarism Detection Resolution  59 
method, namely that looking up the different features between intrinsic segment and the 
rest by using pre-defined rules, to identify abnormal segments. For example, Stamatatos 
[1] mined the string features in text and then detected plagiarism. And Essen [3] proposed 
the average word frequency and compared it with a text lexicalized computing method 
which proposed by Honore [4] and Yule [5]. Oberreuter [6] proposed a method to judge 
whether it was plagiarism by using words frequency features. 
3 Intrinsic Plagiarism Detection Framework 
3.1 System Framework 
The system framework of intrinsic plagiarism detection based on supervised learning is 
shown in Fig. 1. This framework includes four stages: chunk, feature extraction, 
quantitative feature extraction and plagiarism recognization. It pre-processes the data 
set firstly, and then extracts features from pre-processed data and quantizes them, 
finally a plagiarism detection model is applied to recognize plagiaried segments.

3.2 Feature Selection 
We select three effective feature sets to detect intrinsic plagiarism, those specific fea-
ture sets showed in Table 1. 
Table 1. Three effective feature sets 
Feature sets Feature name Description 
Character  NF N-gram frequency of Character, n=3 
Lexicon  WF Word frequency 
AWF Average word frequency 
H-measure Honore’s R measure 
Y-measure Yule’s K measure 
FFW Frequency of function words 
Part-of-speech POS Part-of-speech tag 
60 X. Hua et al. 
Character feature describes the writing style feature defined from the point of view 
of characters’ definition. Stamatatos [7] indicates that n-gram feature is very effective 
in intrinsic plagiarism detection. Lexicon features are extracted as a supplement in 
lacking of character feature. Essen [3] proposed a series of indicators to compute word 
frequency in the text. Many researches indicate function words such as prepositions 
without syntax information can recognize the writing style efficiently. Part-of-speech 
feature reflects writing habits. Part-of-speech feature is more reliable than lexicon 
feature because it reflects the writing habits. 
3.3 Quantizing Feature 
The quantization method is that it compares σ  with σ ,where  σ  is the 
value of j-th style feature in the segment  and σ  is the average value of j-th 
style feature in the test document d where σ  ∑ .  If|σ σ |
, segment is plagiarized where  is a threshold. 
4 Experimental Results 
4.1 Experiment Setting  
Our experiments are based on PAN corpus and we divide it into four subsets showed in 
table 2. 
Table 2. Four subsets pf PAN corpus 
Subsets #Files #Total segments #Average segments Degree of plagiarism 
#P #NP #P #NP #P #NP 
1 200 200 3762 2,5078 10.5 62 0.15 
2 200 200 1407 9,378 4.0 26.3 0.15 
3 200 200 7,116 1,9524 19.8 55 0.40 
4 200 200 2,807 6,978 8.0 18 0.43 
Note: set 1 & 3: long texts, set 2 & 4: short texts, set 1 & 2:minor plagiarism, set 3 & 4: heavy 
plagiarism. P-plagiarized files/segments, NP-non-plagiarized files/segments. 
4.2 Evaluation Method 
This paper evaluates the experimental result through the evaluate method used in PAN 
international plagiarism detection competition, including recall (R), precision (P) and 
F-measure (F). 
Supposed  represents a plagiarism text, then the plagiarism documentg can be 
denoted as , , , where the segment  in the document 
 is plagiarized from the segment  in the document . The case to detect 
plagiarism denoted as , , ,  where the segment   
plagiarized from the segment  in the document  . If , 
 Research on Intrinsic Plagiarism Detection Resolution  61 
 and , the plagiarized segment is detected. We assume the 
set of all exiting real plagiarisms in the text denoted as S and the set of the plagiarism 
segments which have been detected denoted as R. 
Thus P, R, F are given by P , 1| | | || | ; R , 1| | | || | ; F ,  2  
4.3 Results and Analyses 
We introduce the SVMLight as the classifier and verify the result using 10-fold 
cross-validation. Table 3 shows the results. 
Table 3. Experimental result on intrinsic plagiarism detection 
Corpus Non-plagiarized files Plagiarized files 
P R F P R F 
1 0.89 0.87 0.88 0.53 0.62 0.57 
2 0.77 0.84 0.80 0.48 0.41 0.44 
3 0.73 0.80 0.76 0.72 0.76 0.74 
4 0.70 0.69 0.69 0.66 0.68 0.67 
 
From table 3, we can draw a conclusion that long texts are easier to be detected than 
that of short texts, and plagiarism rate is the proportion to detection performance. 
To explore the contribution of single feature on classification performance, we do 
the corresponding experiment, and table 4 shows the result. The results show that: 
1. The Lexical features can get the optimal recall and precision according to the 
results which only use one of the three feature sets independently. 
2. The combination of chararcter and POS feature can upgrade recall, so the 
overall performance is increased by 2%. 
Table 4. Results based on single feature set 
Feature P R F 
Cha 0.23 0.46 0.30 
Lex 0.36 0.51 0.42 
Pos 0.26 0.34 0.29 
Cha+Lex 0.43 0.42 0.42 
Lex+Pos 0.45 0.54 0.49 
Cha+Pos 0.25 0.48 0.32 
ALL 0.53 0.62 0.57 
We also observe the effect to the performance through increasing the scale of data 
gradually, and get the result as shown in table 5. 
62 X. Hua et al. 
Table 5. Performance varies with corpus scale 
 
 
From the analysis, we can see that the precision is increased firstly and then has a 
small amount of volatility to be reduced on the increased size of training set, but the 
recall is increased sharply. The performance of the system is still improved in spite of 
the range is slowed down gradually. So the growth of training data still is helpful to 
improve the performance of the system. 
5 Conclusions and Future Work 
This paper proposes an intrinsic plagiarism detection resolution based on supervised 
learning approach. The result of the experiment shows that this resolution is very 
efficient. In the future work, more efficient structure features will be taken into con-
sideration to upgrade the performance of intrinsic plagiarism detection.
