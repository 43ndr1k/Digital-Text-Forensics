Abstract - Nowadays many industries and governments have 
become dependent on the use of e-mail as an expedient and 
economical form of communication over the Internet and 
Intranet. There is a disturbing increase in the number of 
cybercrime incidents through anonymous e-mails. The problem 
with e-mail authorship verification is to identify the most likely 
author of an anonymous e-mail from a group of potential 
suspects. In this paper, we propose a UserProtector procedure 
based on a multiple character n-gram method, which yields 
good performance ratios for filtering fraudulent messages only 
upon the subject e-mails. The method is effective yet without 
sacrificing performance. There are two major procedures. 
First, training data is used to establish the model and create 
the threshold from the training dataset, and then detect the 
fraudulent mail in real time. Experiments on real-life e-mails 
suggest that the proposed method can effectively identify the 
author and these results are supported by satisfactory 
evidence.

1. Introduction 
E-mail is one of the most widely used media of 
communication over the Internet, and its traffic has increased 
exponentially with the inception of the World Wide Web. 
Nowadays many industries and governments have become 
dependent on the use of e-mail as an economical and 
convenient form of communication over the Internet and 
Intranet. A considerable amount of business, government and 
personal messages are exchanged through e-mail systems each 
day. Unfortunately the increase in e-mail traffic has lead to an 
undesired increase in the use of e-mail for illegitimate purposes 
including: (a) sending Spam or unsolicited commercial e-mail 
causes the widespread distribution of junk e-mail; (b) sending 
hoaxes or forbidden propaganda leads to the distribution of 
computer viruses, worms, and unauthorized conveyance of 
sensitive information; (c) sending child pornography, and 
sexually oriented materials influences social stability.  Terrorist 
groups and criminal gangs are also using e-mail systems as a 
safe channel for their communication.  
For example, CNN and the Economist reported that the 
discovery of GhostNet grew out of suspicions that the office of 
the Dalai Lama had been hacked. His staff sent a foreign 
 
. 
diplomat an e-mail invitation to meet the Tibetan spiritual 
leader, but before the Dalai Lama's people could follow up with 
a phone call, "the diplomat's office was contacted by the 
Chinese government and warned not to go ahead with the 
meeting," according to the report. The investigation found links 
to computers in China, but the researchers did not conclude 
who they thought was behind the malicious software [1][2].  
There has been a disturbing increase in the number of 
cybercrime incidents through anonymous e-mails. The 
problem of e-mail authorship verification is to identify the most 
likely author of an anonymous e-mail from a group of potential 
suspects. However, there are currently no effective methods for 
preventing these phenomena. The current methods apply 
simply some passive defensive actions such as e-mail filtering, 
installing firewalls, security scans etc. But they have inherent 
limitations and cannot avoid the e-mail misuse phenomena. So 
the capacity to provide empirical evidence and identify the 
original author of e-mail misuse is an important factor for the 
WWW. 
Authorship identification has been very successful in 
resolving verification disputes over literary and conventional 
writings. However, e-mail authorship identification poses some 
special challenges due to its special characteristics of size and 
composition, as compared to literary works. Literary 
documents are usually large in size and comprised of at least 
several paragraphs that have a definitive syntactic and semantic 
structure. In contrast, e-mails which are short in size and 
usually do not follow definite syntactic or grammatical rules; 
therefore, it is hard to learn about the writing patterns of their 
authors from them. Compared with general documents, the 
purpose for email is message transmission, of which most of 
them are free style, less structured, abbreviation oriented and 
contain lots of symbolic characters for effective 
communication. Moreover, e-mails are more interactive and 
informal in style, and people are not conscious about the 
spelling and grammatical mistakes particularly in informal 
e-mails [5]. Most previous studies [6][7][8][9][10] with author 
identification employed a traditional classification approach, 
such as a decision tree and Support Vector Machine (SVM), to 
identify the author and study the effects of different writing 
style features on classification accuracy. However, when it is 
applied to certain domain documents, the challenges are the 
diverse writing styles, habits, structures and syntax. Therefore 
techniques, which are very successful in literary and traditional 
works, are not applicable to email authorship identification. 
Obtaining the author’s identity encounters difficulties since the 
sender will attempt to hide his/ her identity in order to avoid 
detection. However, humans are creatures of habit and have

certain personal traits, which tend to persist.  
Other methods [3][4] proposed are based on the n-gram 
approach, which is used frequently to model phenomena in 
native languages and are insensitive to grammar, syntax and 
paragraph structure. However, they do in fact scan the entire 
email content. In this work, we aim at proposing effective 
methods without sacrificing performance. We develop a 
UserProtector algorithm based on a multiple character n-gram 
method, which yields good performance ratios for filtering 
spam messages upon the subject of e-mails where, most of the 
vital information exists. First, training data are used to establish 
the model, and then detect the fraudulent mail in real time. 
Experiments on real e-mails suggest that the proposed method 
can effectively identify the author with the results being 
supported by strong evidence. 
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. 
Section 2 reviews related works and arguments that this work 
extends existing approaches in a significant way. Section 3 
describes the proposed model and the UserProtector 
Procedures. Section 4 presents experimental results based on 
real life data. Conclusions are given in Section 5. 
  
2. Related works 
Authorship identification has been very successful in 
resolving authorship verification disputes over literary and 
conventional writings. The research of authorship verification 
is to identify the most likely author from a group of potential 
suspects [11][12]. The most important task is to extract the 
style features from their writings. Authorship identification has 
been applied to E-mail [13][14] with the inception of the World 
Wide Web, plagiarism mining [15] and instances for the court 
[16].  
Most previous studies [17] with author identification 
employed a traditional classification approach, and studied the 
effects of different writing style features on the classification 
accuracy. [18] Classifying them into 4 kinds of features:1) 
lexical features, 2) syntactic features, 3) structural features and 
4) content-specific features. Most of current researches for 
authorship identification try to summarize the different features, 
for example, Decision Tree [19], Neural Network [20], 
Bayesian probabilistic approach [21][22] and Support Vector 
Machines [23]. Among them, Holmes [24][3][4] offers the 
n-gram method, which grasps most of the four features. 
Burrows S. [25], Keselj [26] and Ali C [27] also found the 
n-gram method to be adaptive to different kinds of languages. 
Tony A. A. [28] found the high of n in n-grams, contained more 
information gain. However, they are not proportional to the 
accuracy. Hirojkmi Y. & Yoshinori S.[29] showed that how to 
decide the n is worth discussing. Efstathios S. when n=3, 
n-grams shows the best accuracy for authorship identification.  
There are only a few studies related to the authorship 
identification of e-mail. Most previous studies [6][7][8][9][10] 
employed a traditional classification approach, such as a 
decision tree and Support Vector Machine (SVM), to identify 
the author. They all suffer from the free style, less structure, are 
abbreviation oriented containing lots of symbolic characters for 
e-mails. Moreover, e-mails are more interactive and informal 
in style, and people are not conscious of spelling and 
grammatical mistakes particularly in informal e-mails. [30]. F 
Iqbal et al. [5] and I Rigoutsos et al. [31] also suggested using 
n-grams to identify the authorship of e-mails; however, both 
their methods have to scan the whole e-mail content.  In this 
study, we proposed a UserProtector procedure based on a 
multiple character n-gram method, which yielded good 
performance ratios for filtering fraudulent messages only 
concerning the subject e-mails. 
Experiments on real e-mail content suggest that the 
proposed method can effectively identify the author. 
 
3. Proposed model and procedures 
In this section we describe the proposed model with 
corresponding UserProtector algorithm. There are two major 
steps, first is to create the threshold from the training dataset 
and then fraud detection in real time.  
3.1 Training dataset with multiple n-gram 
method 
There are five major steps in this method:  
1) Extract the multiple n-gram from the subjects. For 
example, suppose there are 4 e-mails from the same 
sender and their subjects are as follows: 
Mail-1：「中央大學碩士論文口試」  
Mail-2：「Re:Re:中央大學碩士論文口試」  
Mail-3：「企研所碩士論文口試時間」  
Mail-4：「碩士論文紙本電子檔」  
Suppose we would like to extract at most 3 grams, then for 
mail-1, we have extracted the following results: 
1-grams： 「中」「央」 「大」「學」「碩」「士」「論」 
「文」「口」「試」  
2-grams： 「中央」「央大」 「大學」「學碩」「碩士」 
「士論」「論文」「文口」「口試」 
3-grams： 「中央大」「央大學」 「大學碩」「學碩士」  
「碩士論」「士論文」「論文口」「文口試」 
 
After extracting the rest of the subjects, we have the result 
of frequency for 23 patterns with 1-gram as Table1, the result 
of frequency for 23 patterns with 2-grams as Table2, and the 
result of frequency for 22 patterns with 3-grams as Table3.

2) Elimination items from common words. 
Because some common words such as response words 
“RE:” and “Re:” in e-mail cannot present individual style, we 
have to eliminate them. Consequently, we remove items “R”, 
“e”, “:” from 1-gram, items “Re”, “eR”, “e:” from 2-grams,  
and items “Re:”, “eR:” from 3-grams.   
 
3) Extract style features set by top k % 
Due to quantity of e-mail from different authors varying 
considerably, we adapt a top k% frequent pattern as 
individual’s style features set. For example, when k% is set to 
25%, it should be only 20*25%=5 items for 1-gram left. 
However the frequency for the 5
th
 item and the 6
th
 item are the 
same, we have 6 items remaining for 1-gram in the style feature 
set as Table 4. 2-grams and 3-grams are done in the same way, 
and the results are as Table5 and Table6.

4) Calculate weight of each n-grams 
After extracting the style features, next we may calculate 
the score for each subject from information gain with 
corresponding n-grams. However, the value of information 
gain is different for each n-gram of different length. Generally, 
longer n-grams contain more information gain than that of 
shorter ones. We thus assign different weight to each n-grams 
to reflect the extra information value. That’s the core of 
multiple n-gram. 
First, for each item in n-grams compared with shorter 
n-gram in the style features set, i.e. top k% items with shorter 
n-grams. If there is any part of the items, which cannot be 
covered by items in the shorter n-grams, then it receives the 
extra information gain. For example, when we have 1 item 「碩
士論」in 3-grams, we may extract three 1-gram items, i.e.,  
「碩」「士」「論」, there is no extra information gain since 
we can find them from Table4. Same for 「士論文」「論文口」
「文口試」. However take 「大學碩」 as example, we may 
extract three 1-gram items, i.e.,  「大」「學」「碩」, there exists 
extra information gain since we cannot find 「大」「學」 from 
Table4, the information for this item is 2/3. We keep 
comparison information with those items in 2-grams. Same 
example of 1 item 「碩士論」 in 3-grams, we may extract two 
2-grams items, i.e.,  「碩士」「士論」, there is no extra 
information gain since we can find them from Table5. Same for 
「士論文」「論文口」「文口試」. However take 「大學碩」 
as example, we may extract two 2-grams items, i.e.,  「大學」
「學碩」, there exists extra information gain since we cannot 
find them from Table5, the information gain for this item is 2/2. 
Table 7 shows the extra-gain of 3-grams from 1-gram and 
2-grams. 
 
TABLE 7 
INFORMATION GAIN FOR 3-GRAMS

Extra gain –

3/3 3/3 2/3 1/3 
Extra gain – 
2-grams 
2/2 2/2 2/2 1/2 
 
 
 
 
The weighted average for 3-grams from extra gain of 
1-gram is (4*0/3 + 4*0/3 + 3*0/3 + 3*0/3 + 2*3/3 + 2*3/3 + 
2*2/3 + 2*1/3)/22=6/22=0.2727, and from extra gain of 
2-grams is 0.3182. The total weight for 3-grams = 1 + 0.2727 + 
0.3182 =1.5909.  Again Table 8 shows the extra-gain of 
2-grams from 1-gram. The weight for 2-grams = 1 + 0 =0. The 
weight for 1-gram is 1 by itself. The formula for the weight of 
n-gram is : 
Wn = 1 +

5) Computing the accept/reject threshold 
 After obtaining the weight of each n-grams. We may 
proceed to compute the score for each subject from training 
data.  
Score of a subject with n-grams =  
Where  is the weight of i-grams and  is the ratio of 
the N-gram items from the Style Features Set. For our 
examples, scores = (1*N1)+(1*N2)+(1.5909*N3), the result 
for 4 testing subjects is as Table9. 
 
TABLE 9 
SCORE FOR 4 SUBJECTS 
Subject Score

企研所碩士論文口試時間 1.753 
碩士論文紙本電子檔 1.273 
 
As we mentioned, the quantity of e-mail from different 
authors is quite different and also it’s difficult to assume the 
score distribution of each author. Thus, we adopt Chebyshev’s 
Theorem, where there should be at least 1-(1/k)
2
 data lying 
between k standard deviation from mean value with k >1. 
When the score of one subject is high, it means that the e-mail 
contains a lot of information from the style features; it belongs 
to the same author with a high probability. The concept of 
threshold is similar to the critical value with 1 tail in the 
hypothesis of the Statistics. When the score of a subject is 
lower than the critical value, we will reject the e-mail, i.e. the 
mail is not from the same author. The score distribution could 
be normal distribution. Take into consideration, if k=3, then 
there is only 0.15% of data which would be rejected, results in 
high Type II error(β ) as in Table 10. If k=2, there is 2.5% of 
data which would be rejected for normal distribution and 
12.5%~25% would be rejected for other distribution. Thus, we 
define the critical value = mean - 2 * standard deviations as our 
threshold.

From the example of Table9, the mean of scores = 2.1298 
and σ = 0.6393, then the threshold = 2.1298 – 2 x (0.6393) = 
0.8512. If the score of a new subject from that author is less 
than 0.8512, we will reject the mail. 
 
Fig. 1.  Score that rejects the author 
3.2 Real Time Fraud Detection Method 
Once we obtain the threshold from the training data, the 
RFDM is very simple and efficient in identifying the 
authorship. First we have to extract multiple n-grams for this 
new subject, and compare them with that of the style feature set 
from the training dataset. Calculate the score of the new subject 
and compare it with threshold of the training dataset.  
For example, there are 2 e-mails, mail-1 is from the same 
author and mail-2 is not, their subjects are as follows: 
Mail-1：「論文口試成績」  
Mail-2：「神阿!!! 讓我的口試順利吧」 
The result of frequency for Mail-1 with 3-grams after 
extraction of the n-grams is as Table11. Items found from 
Table4, Table4 and Table5 are marked. The score of the subject 
from Mail-1 is 1*4/6+ 1*3/5+1.5909*2/4=2.0621. Accept that 
Mail-1 is from the same authorship with testing data. However, 
the score of the subject from Mail-2 is 0.2198, which is less 
than 0.8517. Reject that Mail-2 is from the same authorship 
with testing data. 
  
TABLE 11

4. Experimental results 
4.1 Purpose of Experiments 
From Table 10, we would like to increase 1 – α (accept the 
true authorship) and 1-β (reject the false authorship) as high as 
possible, precision is the sum of them. If the results show the desired 
situation, it means the proposed multiple n-grams algorithm is 
effective and efficient for identifying authorship. 
  
4.2 Real-Life Data Description and 
Preparation  
Data set contains 13,673 e-mails from one professor’s 
e-mail box of National Central University, Taiwan, ROC. 
Subjects composed of Chinese characters, English letters, mix 
of them and other symbols. In our experiment, we preprocess to 
filter out those e-mails classified as spam and forwarded 
e-mails. About six thousand e-mails remained containing only 
mails really written from some authors. The reasons are 1) 
spams are generally junk e-mails for commercial purposes, 
advertisements, pornography, etc. Those are normal 
communication from receiver’s perspective, 2) Style features 
of forwarding letters are never the same as the sender. Finally, 
we randomly select 1,500 e-mails as training dataset, the other 
4,500 e-mails are for testing. 
4.3 Experiments for accepting e-mails from 
true authors 
First, dividing the 1,500 training data into 3 groups, 
according to the quantity of e-mail from same author, group 1 
contained authors with 5 to 15 e-mails, group 2 contained 
authors with 15 to 30 e-mails, and group 3 contained authors 
with over 30 e-mails. Next, randomly select 10 authors from 
each group totaling 30 authors. Randomly select 10 e-mails for 
these 30 authors from 4,500 testing dataset. When top k% is set 
to 0.2, the result is as Fig.2, and when top k% is set to 0.3, the 
result is as Fig.3. They showed that more samples, higher 
accuracy, and accuracy is between 0.75 and 0.91 with an 
average of 0.81. The results are satisfying. 
 
 
Fig. 2. Accuracy that accept the true author (1-α ) with k=0.2 
 
 
Fig. 3. Accuracy that accept the true author (1-α ) with k=0.3 
 
4.4 Experiments for rejecting e-mails from 
false authors 
Similar to the previous experiment, we divided the 1,500 
training data into 3 groups, according to the quantity of e-mail 
from same author When top k% is set to 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, the results 
are as Fig.4, Fig.5, and Fig.6 respectively. They also indicated 
high accuracy, and accuracy is between 0.76 and 1 with an 
average of 0.93. The results are also satisfying.

Fig. 6. Accuracy that reject the false author (1-β ) with k=0.4 
 
4.5 Experiments for relations among top-k, α 
and β 
Value for top k is the parameter for style feature set, it will 
affect the quantity of items in the style feature set, then 
influences the matched frequency for n-grams with subjects. 
This resulted in the change of the weight of n-grams and the 
critical value to accept or reject an e-mail. Among different 
e-mails even from the same author were somewhat different in 
style. If k is small, the less the items in the style feature set, the 
less the weight, the less the mean from training data, the less 
the critical value. On the contrary, vice versa. The change of 
critical value effects Type I (α )and Type II (β ) error. When 
Identifying authorship, we expect both accuracy of  (1-α )and 
(1-β ) to be as high as possible. Unfortunately, we may not take 
care of them both simultaneously. The price of smallerα is 
higherβ . Thus we have to decide which situation will lead to a 
serious problem. For this study, Type II error (accepting the 
false author) is more serious than that of Type I (rejecting the 
true author). The purpose we pursue is to keep α andβ as 
minimized as possible, while β  playing a more important role 
than α , then decide the value for top k. From the results of Fig. 
7 through Fig. 11, they all indicated that the better k is between 
0.2 and 0.3.

5 Conclusions 
In this paper, we proposed a UserProtector procedure based 
on a multiple character n-gram method, which yields good 
performance ratios for filtering fraudulent messages only 
pertaining to the subject e-mails where most of the information 
existed. The method is effective yet without sacrificing 
performance. There are two major procedures. First, training 
data are used to establish the model and create the threshold 
from the training dataset, and then detect the fraudulent e-mail 
in real time. Calculating the threshold is comprised of five steps: 
1) Extraction of the multiple n-gram from the subjects, 2) 
Elimination of items from common words, 3) Extraction of 
style features set by top k %, 4) Calculation of weight of each 
n-grams and 5) Computation of the accept/reject threshold. 
Experiments on real e-mails suggest that the proposed 
method can effectively identify the author with the results 
being supported by strong evidence.
