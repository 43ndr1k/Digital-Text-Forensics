Abstract
The earliest stages of cognitive decline in cases of slowly progressive dementia are difficult to pinpoint,
yet detection of the preclinical period of the illness is likely to be of significant importance to under-
standing Alzheimer’s disease and other slowly progressive dementias at both clinical and biological levels.
A number of authors have used retrospective analysis to describe preclinical linguistic decline in written
texts and spoken language samples. This paper reviews the methods available for classifying and
comparing such samples, and presents some exploratory analyses of historical texts derived from verbatim
records of preclinical spoken activity. Change in the nature of the language used by Harold Wilson (Prime
Minister of the United Kingdom 1964e1970 and 1974e1976) is quantified in the light of a later diagnosis
of probable Alzheimer’s disease and historical uncertainties about his final months in office.

1. Introduction
Functional reserve is a property of many biological systems whose performance depends on
the cumulative effects of populations of similarly-structured subunits. Mammals are, for
example, endowed with pairs of organs (lungs, kidneys, adrenal glands, and gonads), whose
physiological effects under normal conditions are not detectably changed if one of the pair is
lost or otherwise rendered inoperative, and the other partially compromised. Unpaired organs,
such as the liver and heart, will also continue to meet circulatory and metabolic/digestiveE-mail address: p.garrard@soton.ac.uk

251P. Garrard / Journal of Neurolinguistics 22 (2009) 250e265demands in the face of marked depletion of their constituent cells. Given the obvious adaptive
advantages of this redundancy to creatures competing for reproductive success in a Hobbesian
environment, it would be surprising if the organ system that mediates behaviour, learning,
perception, planning, decision making, and communication was not similarly endowed.
In its mature state, the analogy with other paired organs is not applicable to the hemispheric
structure of the brain (though the similarity may hold during development (de Bode & Curtiss,
2000; Vicari et al., 2000)). Moreover, the demonstrable heterogeneity of function within
different regions of the cerebral cortex means that the effects of a focal insult are seldom
completely ameliorated by compensatory activity in undamaged regions. Nonetheless, the
brain’s capacity to support normal levels of cognitive activity in the face of gradual decline in
the structural and functional integrity of its constituent elements implies that a degree of
redundancy is indeed built into the system’s architecture, a point that is strikingly illustrated by
the not uncommon finding of marked cerebral atrophy on CT or MRI brain scans of cognitively
normal elderly subjects (Matsubayashi et al., 1992).
The existence of a functional reserve capacity in the brain (Fig. 1) is supported, and can to
a limited extent be quantified, by postmortem studies of the nigrostriatal systems of aged brains.
Neuronal depletion within these paired mid-brain structures produces the classical, ‘idiopathic’
form of Parkinson’s disease (a syndrome of progressive motor dysfunction characterized by the
emergence of tremor, rigidity and loss of dexterity), whose earliest effects are often relieved by
the pharmacological supplementation of the neurotransmitter dopamine. Postmortem exami-
nation of the striatum has revealed cases with marked degrees of dopamine depletion associated
with only mild motor symptoms at the time of death, suggesting a significant, if variable,
functional reserve capacity inherent in the system (Bernheimer et al., 1973).
The notion of a reserve capacity for more global measures of cognitive function has also
been upheld by postmortem studies focusing on the common causes of late-onset dementia
syndromes. The most pervasive of these is Alzheimer’s disease (AD), which gives rise to0

Cognitive function
Fig. 1. Illustrative representation of the course of a neurodegenerative condition at the functional and neuronal levels.
The diagram includes three key points in the clinical evolution of dementia: the onset of the earliest symptoms (point
A); the diagnosis of the condition (point B); and death (point C). The duration of the period to the left of point A is
unknown.
252 P. Garrard / Journal of Neurolinguistics 22 (2009) 250e265a progressive and irreversible decline in a range of cognitive abilities, typically beginning with
episodic memory (Galton et al., 2000). The clinical features of AD normally begin in the sixties
or seventies, with diagnosis depending on the recognition of the typical pattern of symptom-
atology and the exclusion of other, more unusual causes of late-life cognitive decline. Verifi-
cation of the diagnosis, however, requires the demonstration of amyloid plaques (AP) and
neurofibrillary tangles (NFT) within the substance of the brain, normally at autopsy.
Although postmortem examination is carried out in only a minority of cases, careful corre-
lations between clinical and pathological findings have revealed a complex relationship between
these two descriptive levels. The seminal studies of Braak and Braak (1995) traced a characteristic
sequence of NFT formation that followed a neuroanatomical pathway through entorhinal, limbic,
and finally isocortical stages. Tomlinson, Blessed, and Roth (1970) demonstrated that cognitive
function could be preserved in the presence of established degenerative disease, suggesting that
clinical dementia, like Parkinsonism, may occur when pathological change exceeds a certain
threshold level. More recent community-based surveys of autopsy findings in an unselected
sample of elderly people in the United Kingdom found evidence of vascular and/or degenerative
changes in almost 80% (Neuropathology Group of MRC CFAS, 2001), a figure that sits in striking
contrast to estimated clinically-defined dementia prevalence rates among the ‘‘oldest old’’ of
around 25% (Fichter et al., 1995). Perhaps most striking of all was a cross-sectional neuropath-
ological study of incidental Alzheimer changes in postmortem brains across a wide age spectrum,
which suggested that a disease whose clinical manifestations typically appear in the seventh or
eighth decade of life may begin to develop in early adulthood (Ohm et al., 1995).
The ability to identify and measure the earliest phase of AD e ie after the earliest patho-
logical changes but before the patient meets diagnostic criteria for dementia (ie anywhere to the
left of point ‘‘B’’ in Fig. 1) e could provide important insights into the phenomenon of
cognitive reserve. Since the duration of this presymptomatic period reflects the capacity of the
reserve, any marked degree of variability would clearly be of further interest e as well as
enormous socioeconomic importance e if any environmental factors (eg diet, education,
intellectual engagement in later life) could be shown to be positively or negatively correlated
with it. Before discussing existing and future attempts to acquire this information, however, the
clinical characteristics of patients with established AD will be briefly reviewed.
Neuropsychological studies of AD have revealed a cumulative pattern of deficits mapping on to
the anatomical pattern of progression described by Braak and Braak (1995): episodic memory
deficits (attributable to mesial temporal and limbic involvement) usually occur in the earliest stages,
while effects on semantic memory, visuospatial skills, word production, and executive function
(indicating disruption of neocortical regions) emerge later. In a minority of (usually younger onset)
cases, bimanual praxis is the earliest and clinically dominant feature (‘biparietal variant AD’)
(Galton et al., 2000; Ross et al., 1996). Given the language system’s complexity and dependence on
multiple and widespread cortical regions, it is perhaps not surprising that detailed studies of
language processing in AD have provided some of the most valuable contributions at the neuro-
psychological level. Analyses of individuals and groups have demonstrated disruption in produc-
tion and comprehension at both word and sentence level (Croot, Hodges, & Patterson, 1999; Croot
et al., 2000; Kempler et al., 1998), and disintegration of semantic memory (Garrard et al., 1998).
2. Measuring cognitive reserve
Neuropsychological data is not normally acquired until there are already clinical grounds for
making a diagnosis of AD (ie some way down the cognitive function slope illustrated in Fig. 1),
253P. Garrard / Journal of Neurolinguistics 22 (2009) 250e265and is therefore unable to tell us anything about the trajectory of the line prior to point ‘‘B’’.
Moreover, many studies have employed assessment techniques based on standardised tasks
such as word fluency and picture naming, all of which may be subject to effortful compen-
sation, or to ceiling or floor effects depending on premorbid educational level (O’Carroll &
Ebmeier, 1995). Finally, because theoretically motivated methods of evaluation are designed to
test hypotheses about functional organisation, such tests tend to be sensitive to a relatively
narrow subset of deficits.
The importance of the earlier, prediagnostic, period of patients’ cognitive histories has given
rise to the concept of ‘mild cognitive impairment’ (MCI), a state in which a patient may be
aware of and report symptoms of cognitive dysfunction, but which is at too early a stage of
progression to justify a diagnosis of dementia (between points ‘‘A’’ and ‘‘B’’ in Fig. 1)
(Bruscoli & Lovestone, 2004). As we have seen, diagnosing AD is ‘probabilistic’ (ie a judge-
ment of the future likelihood of finding plaque and tangle pathology in the brain), and the
recognition of MCI adds a further layer of uncertainty e namely the need to distinguish
between an essentially stable state of mild impairment (eg due to anxiety, depression, or the
‘ageing process’) and one that is destined to deteriorate at some future time (ie those in the
earliest stages of AD).
It is perhaps not surprising that patients with MCI are neuropsychologically heterogeneous
(Nordlund et al., 2005), nor that the proportion of MCI cases who go on to develop dementia
within a year is highly variable, in some samples lower than 10% (Bruscoli & Lovestone,
2004). Consequently, using the duration of MCI as a surrogate for the cognitive reserve
capacity is difficult to justify, and highlights the need for a retrospective approach that allows
a reliable index of the duration of the preclinical period to be reproducibly obtained.
A number of studies have already demonstrated how this might be effectively achieved using
archived language samples dating back years, or even decades, before the onset of cognitive
symptoms. Such outputs are free from the distorting effects that knowledge or suspicion of
incipient cognitive decline might have on performance, and are interpreted under three basic
assumptions: 1) that the material in question is reliably datable; 2) that there are measurable
differences between the characteristics of such samples from individuals with normal and
disordered cognition; and 3) that these differences become more pronounced with progression
of the disease.
If these conditions are met, then the onset of any relevant change in a text corpus should be
identifiable. This will, in turn, allow objective and reproducible estimates of the duration of the
presymptomatic and preclinical phases of the disease to be made. If obtained from large enough
cohorts of affected individuals, such measurements could provide insights into the factors
determining variations in preclinical states, and suggest strategies for optimizing them. Progress
towards this goal has come from retrospective analyses of language samples that have been
recorded or archived for various reasons.2.1. The Nun studyThis ongoing longitudinal study traces incident dementia among members of a religious
order using interval neuropsychological assessment and postmortem examination. The study
has also examined premorbid linguistic data produced by participants as many as fifty years
before the appearance of the earliest symptoms of AD (Snowdon, 2003). Between 1931 and
1943, at ages of between 18 and 32 years, subjects were required to write their autobiographies
on entry into the order. When, many years later, these texts were analysed for measures of
254 P. Garrard / Journal of Neurolinguistics 22 (2009) 250e265syntactic complexity and idea density, lower scores on both dimensions predicted poorer
performance on memory and other cognitive tests many decades later. Intriguingly, a subgroup
analysis identified reliably lower initial idea density scores in individuals in whom Alzheimer
pathology was demonstrated at postmortem. The latter finding was interpreted as suggesting the
existence of common factors underpinning both neurocognitive development and susceptibility
to AD (Snowdon et al., 1996).
Updated autobiographies, written by a subset of the original entrants in the late 1950’s and
again in the late 1980’s, were used for a longitudinal comparison, which supported an apparently
linear decline on both measures over the course of the lifespan (Kemper et al., 2001).
Surprisingly, the rate of decline did not differ between those who were later diagnosed with
dementia and those who remained cognitively healthy into later life though a similar study using
data from more regular language assessments of a different group of volunteers did demonstrate
a difference in the rate of decline in idea density (Kemper, Thompson, & Marquis, 2001).
Several aspects of the Nun Study data are clearly relevant to the question of accurately
estimating cognitive reserve: the first is that the retrospective linguistic data employed (ie the
written diary entries) were not only naturalistic but free from any compensatory biases that
might derive from an awareness of being tested. A second is the uniformity, over a number of
behavioural and demographic dimensions, of the participants themselves. As Kemper notes
(Kemper et al., 2001):Participants in the Nun Study have led relatively homogeneous adult lives. Participants
have the same reproductive and marital histories, have similar social activities and
support throughout their adult lives, have similar occupations and incomes, have equal
access to preventative health and medical care, and do not smoke or drink alcohol
excessively [p. 238].Because some or all of these ‘‘lifestyle factors’’ are likely to be important in determining the
robustness of the cognitive reserve, however, informative variations in the linguistic data may
be missed when study participants are well matched. Moreover, those subjects who were fol-
lowed up over their entire lifetime were observed on at most three occasions e perhaps
insufficient to detect subtle changes in language samples predating the clinical onset of
dementia. Although Kemper et al. assumed that the decline seen in both the demented and non-
demented groups was linear, a larger number of observations might have demonstrated
a departure from linearity e for example, a longer maintenance period followed by a precipitate
decline in successfully aging subjects, and a more gradual decline in those who developed
dementia (see Fig. 2). Such longitudinal differences would be compatible with variations in the
cognitive reserve.2.2. The Iris Murdoch studyThe celebrated English novelist and philosopher Iris Murdoch (1922e1999) was diagnosed
with Alzheimer’s disease in 1997, following deterioration in her cognitive abilities, particularly
marked in the domain of language. Postmortem examination of her brain later confirmed the
presence of diagnostic amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles as the dominant pathological
feature. Murdoch may have been the first to notice her own decline; in an interview published in
The Observer, she commented on an uncharacteristic ‘writer’s block’ that had plagued her while
she was writing her final novel, Jackson’s Dilemma, in 1995. To look for prediagnostic
Alzheimer-like characteristics in the language of this work, Garrard et al. (2005) studied stylistic,

255P. Garrard / Journal of Neurolinguistics 22 (2009) 250e265syntactic and lexical attributes, comparing them with works composed at earlier periods in her
four-and-a-half decade long writing career. To enhance the power of the analyses digitised
versions of the complete texts were used. Concordance software (Watt, 2002) generated word
lists, type-to-token ratios, and collocation (pairs of word types occurring at fixed intervals from
one another) statistics. Word and character counts were used to derive sentence length distri-
butions, as an indirect index of syntactic complexity (Rosenberg & Abbeduto, 1987).
Stylistic and syntactic analyses revealed no detectable differences between the three works.
Whether this reflected a relative preservation of syntactic ability in the language disorder of
Alzheimer’s disease e at least in some cases (Croot et al., 1999) e or, perhaps more likely, the
insensitivity of the methods used to assess them (Bates et al., 1995; Kempler et al., 1998), is
unclear. The comparison did, however, detect differences in the lexical characteristics of the
three books. Data indicated an initial phase of enhancement over the first twenty years of IM’s
career, as measured by both the variety (cumulative type-to-token ratios) and frequency (using
published norms (Francis, 1967)) of the vocabulary. This was followed by a later decline on
both measures over the last twenty-five years of her life. All these findings e the absence of any
structural variation, and the marked difference in word frequency without a similar effect of
word length, coupled with a more repetitive and higher frequency vocabulary e mirrored the
changes that have been consistently documented in the spontaneous spoken language of early
Alzheimer’s disease sufferers (Croisile et al., 1995; Croisile et al., 1996; Garrard et al., 1998;
Kremin et al., 2001).
Indirectly, the Murdoch data also implied the existence of a detectable gradient in abnormal
linguistic characteristics, as formal neuropsychological testing two years after AD was diag-
nosed demonstrated a similar, though more severe, impoverishment of vocabulary, semantic
impairment, frequency-dependent anomia, and a surface dysgraphia (Garrard et al., 2005).
A more decisive demonstration of this putative gradient, however, would clearly require
a comparison of like with like, and a more extensive survey of the impressive literary output
from the last fifteen years of Murdoch’s working life (Table 1) is likely to yield information
about its nature and temporal characteristics.

256 P. Garrard / Journal of Neurolinguistics 22 (2009) 250e2652.3. Studies of archived spoken languageSpoken output generally requires a greater degree of spontaneity than written, offers fewer
opportunities for off-line revision, and may therefore be a more sensitive indicator of change.
One of the earliest retrospective language studies was carried out by Brian Butterworth, using
televised speeches of the former U.S. President Ronald Reagan. Occurrence rates for errors in
both content and syntax, and for abnormally long word-finding pauses, were significantly
higher during Reagan’s debates against Walter Mondale in 1984 than during similar events in
1980, when he was campaigning against the incumbent President Carter [unpublished data].
Reagan was famously diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease in 1994 e five years after the end of
his second term as President. The announcement of the diagnosis, and the implications of its
progressive nature, gave rise to speculation about Reagan’s mental performance while he was
still in office. The journalist Lesley Stahl, for example, describes an interview with the Pres-
ident in which ‘‘a vacant Reagan barely seemed to realize anyone else was in the room’’ (Stahl,
1999). Regardless of the significance of such one-off anecdotal observations however, the
similarities between Butterworth’s language error data and the language problems characteristic
of Alzheimer’s disease (Schwartz & Moscovitch, 1990), would suggest that the earliest
cognitive effects of the disease were detectable at least ten years before a diagnosis was made.
3. Automated discourse analysis
The techniques used to define differences between texts and between samples of continuous
discourse that have been described so far e such as deriving measures of syntactic complexity
and idea density, and comparing lexical frequency rates using published databases e have for
the most part been normative, top-down methods. Yet this general approach has obvious
disadvantages: the most obvious is its labour intensiveness, which inevitably limits the size of
the text samples to which it can be applied; for informative studies to be conducted on large,
longitudinal written and spoken samples, this is clearly impractical. A second difficulty is that
reliance on lexical frequency norms alone as an index of linguistic change is subject to error,
because i) low frequency words tend to be under-represented in the available databases, and ii)
word usage is subject to prevailing fashion and other transient influences that may not have
been current when the norms were compiled.
Automated, data-driven methods of analysis offer a potential solution to all these difficulties,
and considerable progress has been made in the field of text classification over the past decade
(Feldman & Sanger, 2007; Forsyth, 1999). Various techniques have been validated in the fields
257P. Garrard / Journal of Neurolinguistics 22 (2009) 250e265of authorship attribution (Love, 2002), genre analysis (Stamatatos, Fakotatis, & Kokkinakis,
2000) and topic identification (Clifton, Cooley, & Rennie, 2004), providing the basis for a range
of methods for specifying differences between texts, all of which can be rapidly implemented
using digital text samples as input. A comprehensive survey of these methods is beyond the
scope of the present article, but in view of the potential usefulness to the enterprise of
presymptomatic discourse analysis in cognitive ageing, they will be briefly reviewed.3.1. Digital stylometryBurrows pioneered a method for quantifying differences between texts based on the means
and standard deviations of the proportional frequencies of the n commonest words across
a corpus of contemporary texts of the same genre (Burrows, 2004). The mean of the z-trans-
formed values associated with each word in the target texts yields a summary statistic (Delta),
the magnitude of which varies inversely with similarity. Burrows showed that pairs of texts
originating from male and female authors, from Northern and Southern hemispheres, and from
the 19th and 20th centuries all yielded higher Delta values in between- than within-group
comparisons (Burrows, 2003).
Burrows’ Delta depends on the frequency distributions of the commonest word types, the
majority of which are grammatical (function) words. Similar measures based on mid- or low-
frequency usages (which include more lexical, or content words) are differentially sensitive to
texts of differing length (Burrows, 2006).3.2. N-gram analysisAn extension of the word-count method is to use the frequencies of any recurring feature of
a text from letters upwards, and compare the occurrences of each across samples. N-grams
above the letter level can be flexibly defined in terms of words, parts of speech (using auto-
mated parsing routines), and letter or word collocations, allowing rapid automated comparison
of texts over a range of different dimensions of interest. In the field of forensic linguistics the
method has proved sensitive to differences at lexical, syntactic, and stylistic levels (Chaski,
2004). The approach has also proved successful as a basis for authorship attribution and topic
identification (Peng, Schuurmans, & Wang, 2004).3.3. EntropyJuola (2003) has proposed a method for estimating the inherent redundancy in a piece of
continuous discourse or text. In the framework of information theory (Shannon & Weaver,
1949) entropy is proportional to the number of binary decisions required to determine an
unknown value. Where the values in question are letters of the alphabet, successful discovery of
an unknown could be achieved heuristically by asking sequentially in which half of the
alphabet, which half of that half, and so forth, the target letter is located. This algorithm would
be needed to identify any member of a truly random sequence of letters, but the multiplicity of
constraints that apply to connected discourse greatly reduces the candidate letters that may
complete a fragment of text. A method for arriving at a comprehensive estimate of similarity
between two documents based on one such constraint (ie the tendency for similar strings of
characters to recur), is to determine the average number of consecutive characters in one
document that matches all possible character n-grams within the other (Wyner, 1996). In the
258 P. Garrard / Journal of Neurolinguistics 22 (2009) 250e265extreme case in which the two texts are identical, the value would be simply determined by the
number of characters they (it) contained. In other pairs, higher values would result from more
frequent usages of larger combinations of words. The method would therefore be suitable for
estimating differences between an index text and multiple subsequent outputs by the same
author to identify and timestamp the onset of progressive degrees of deviation.
For these methods to be accepted as appropriate to the analysis of text or discourse passages
in the field of cognitive ageing, they must first be shown to be reliably associated with the
presence of underlying cerebral pathology (Garrard, in press). If they can, then in individuals
who have left behind a datable record of spontaneous verbal activity spanning the presymp-
tomatic, preclinical and symptomatic periods of disease, it should be possible robustly to
identify the earliest vestiges of cognitive change. The usefulness of such a marker to the study
of variations in cognitive reserve has already been discussed, but the detection and dating of
AD like changes in archived language may also prove important in other spheres. By way of an
illustrative case-study I will outline the methods, and some preliminary results, from work
currently in progress relating to a British Prime Minister, Harold Wilson, and the reasons for his
sudden and unexplained resignation from office.4. The Harold Wilson project
The political sphere provides a source of spoken language samples, faithfully transcribed
and saved for posterity since the late 19th century, when Thomas Curson Hansard introduced
the Official Report (usually referred to simply as Hansard, after its founder). Hansard contains
transcripts of all spoken activity in the two Houses of Parliament. Although it cannot and does
not always report every word said by a Member, departures from verbatim are seldom
noticeable, and typically reflect deletions of repeated words, fillers and particles, as well as
corrections of departures from grammatical convention. To illustrate this point, a recent extract
from the Hansard version (A) and a verbatim transcript (B) taken from a live recording, with
altered segments underlined, is reproduced below.
[A]The Prime Minister: I thank my hon. Friend for taking up the cause of veterans in her
constituency. She is absolutely right; last week the Health Secretary announced that
veterans would be accorded priority treatment in the national health service, as they
should be. He also announced that there will be a new community-based veterans’ mental
health care service, which will run for the next two years with independent evaluation.
There are 150 mental health professionals working throughout defence, employed by the
Ministry of Defence, and we are determined to do what we can to support not only our
veterans but all those in our armed forces who do an outstanding job and to whom we owe
a debt of gratitude and a duty of care. (Hansard, 2007).[B]The Prime Minister: Let let let me thank my honourable Friend for taking up the cause of

forces who do an outstanding job and to whom we owe a debt of gratitude and a duty of
care.Naturally, some parliamentary speeches recorded in Hansard would have been read from
texts that may not even have been written by the speaker, so sampling of the archive should be
limited to sessions in which verbal exchanges are less carefully planned. Prime Minister’s
Questions (PMQs), a twice weekly1 opportunity for members to interrogate the Prime Minister
(or a deputy, if he is absent) on a range of matters, would seem to meet these requirements.
Although the questions asked at PMQs are prepared in advance, these can easily be eliminated
from the text to be analysed. The Prime Minister’s responses, follow-up questions, and
subsequent exchanges are, for the most part, unscripted. Indeed, the practice of speaking from
a prepared script during PMQs attracts disapproval, if not derision2.
Longitudinal analysis of the speeches of one celebrated victim of late-life cognitive decline
has the potential to contribute to the resolution of a longstanding historical dispute. Harold
Wilson (HW) is one of the most fascinating characters to have appeared on the British political
stage in recent times, and the motive for his unexpected resignation during a third term as Prime
Minister in 1976 remains one of the great unsolved mysteries of British politics. HW was noted
for his intellectual gifts and academic precocity, his prodigious memory, astute political sense,
and razor-sharp wit in debate (Pimlott, 1993). His unforeseen resignation in the middle of
a third term as Prime Minister has been variously attributed to an alleged involvement with the
KGB (Mitrokhin, 2000), the impact of negative propaganda spread by rogue elements within
the security services (Wright, 1987), and even a plot to replace him forcibly with an emergency
administration headed by Lord Louis Mountbatten. A more prosaic explanation, however, is
that in the months leading up to March 1976, HW was becoming aware of a progressive mental
blunting which, much later, would turn out to have been the preclinical phase of a progressive
degenerative dementia, very probably Alzheimer’s disease (Pimlott, 1993).
The existence of precisely dated language samples from HW and his contemporaries
therefore raises the historically significant possibility that the time course of this preclinical
period may be able to be retrospectively determined. To carry out a textual analysis on so large
a scale, top-down methods would certainly be impractical. I will therefore present some
preliminary results obtained from the Hansard archive using methods broadly similar to those
described above under the heading of ‘Digital stylometry’.
Transcripts of PMQs that were held while HW was Prime Minister (ie firstly between
October 1964 and June 1970 and secondly between March 1974 and April 1976) were obtained
and converted to ASCII format using optical character recognition software. Markers were
added to identify the date at each change of year and month, while the identity and party
affiliation of every speaker was recorded at the beginning of any speech or contribution to
debate. The texts of questions themselves were omitted because they had been prepared in
advance and would in some cases have been read from a script. Unattributable comments and
interjections from the floor were also removed, as were entries that recorded the reading of
a report or communiqué.til 1997 PMQs were held on Tuesday and Thursday mornings, Current practice is for the event to be held once

260 P. Garrard / Journal of Neurolinguistics 22 (2009) 250e265Three twelve-month epochs were selected for analysis: April 1965eMarch 1966; April
1969eMarch 1970; and April 1975eMarch 1976 (the month immediately preceding HW’s
resignation announcement). These periods contain over 200 separate PMQs sessions, at which
HW answered in person in all but 16 (when the deputy leader or a senior Cabinet minster
responded in his absence). If HW’s resignation was, as hypothesised, influenced by his growing
awareness of incipient cognitive decline (or, to use modern terminology, the emergence of the

output across epochs, that would not be detectable in the records of other speakers.
As before, Concordance (Watt, 2002) was used to generate word lists: the corpus contained
537,932 word tokens, and 12,993 unique word types (proper nouns included). Words associated
with a frequency of 1 (hapaxlegomena), accounted for 4765 items. There were 1854 words with
frequency 2, and 1033 with frequency 3, resulting in a heavily skewed distribution. The mean
word frequency was 42.2, with standard deviation 588.9. Pearson analysis of a subset of theseTable 2

262 P. Garrard / Journal of Neurolinguistics 22 (2009) 250e265rates are likely to be idiosyncratic, temporally specific, or both. Two further, exploratory
analyses were carried out to determine whether patterns of individual word frequencies could
provide distinguishing information between speakers and/or epochs.
Implementing the assumptions of Burrows’ delta, usages of the commonest lexical items
were compared across epochs and between speakers (in this analysis, HW was compared to the
pooled data from all other contributors at PMQs). Table 2 lists the 30 most frequently used
terms in the corpus, together with proportional frequencies (percentages of all words) in each of
the three epochs. Values are displayed for the entire corpus and for words spoken by HW.
Comparison of these six sets of values using the Friedman test (a non-parametric equivalent of
a one-sample repeated measures design) revealed no difference [c2(5)¼ 7.76, p¼ 0.17].
A second set of mid-frequency words to be compared, by analogy with the Zeta statistic, was
assembled by selecting the 30 most commonly used content words in the corpus. An equivalent
set of values relating to these items is displayed in Table 3. Using these data, Friedman’s test was
compatible with the 6 sets of values originating from different samples [c2(5)¼ 11.66, p< 0.05].
Multiple pairwise comparisons using Wilcoxson’s test revealed statistically significant differences
between 3 of the 15 possible pairings (see Table 4).
Although these did not include any of the contrasts between HW’s language from 1975 to
1976 (the year preceding his resignation), and either of the other two epochs, two trends are
discernible. The first is that no significant contrasts occur within the ‘‘All speakers’’ sample;
given the considerable overlap in composition of House of Commons membership over this
relatively short time period, this apparent homogeneity is reassuring. The second is that the
contrasts between HW and his colleagues is most marked in 1965e1966 and least so in
1975e1976, raising the possibility that HW’s language was subject to some form of change
between these two epochs. Larger samples of words, more differentiation between individual
speakers, and comparisons of speech samples produced over smaller time intervals are clearly
required to confirm and further refine these preliminary observations. The finding, for
instance, that HW’s lexical choices showed a lesser degree of similarity to those of his
colleagues in the second half of 1975e1976 than in the first, and that similar within-epoch
differences were not apparent in either of the other two years sampled, would provide strong
evidence of change over time. More consistently distinctive patterns separating the language
used by other individual speakers and the group frequencies would further strengthen the
inference that something unusual is taking place in HW’s language as he approaches resig-
nation. The results of these, and other ongoing analyses of this unique text corpus form the
subject of reports currently in preparation.
5. Concluding remarks
As the starting point for this methodological survey I took the clinical course of the neuro-
degenerative dementias or, more specifically, the period prior to symptom onset, during which the
gradual accumulation of neurodegenerative pathology is not accompanied by any apparent
cognitive difficulties. I hypothesised that the spontaneous production of spoken and written
language could act as a preclinical marker of cognitive dysfunction, and if so, that such infor-
mation might prove useful prospectively as a diagnostic marker, retrospectively as a surrogate
measure of cognitive reserve, and historically as a source of biographical information.
A series of studies was outlined to illustrate some of the wide range of methods by which
various features of language function can be quantified. Some, such as the comparison of the
lexical and grammatical characteristics of text elements and the quantification of syntactic
263P. Garrard / Journal of Neurolinguistics 22 (2009) 250e265complexity, are essentially top-down methods, which use the theoretical assumptions of neu-
ropsychological models to characterize a piece of discourse. Although these methods have the
advantage of an empirical basis that allows one to know what to look for as well as how and
why to look for it, they are limited in scope and are frequently dependent on data (eg lexical
frequency) that may not be universally applicable across languages, cultures and time periods.
By contrast, metrics such as cumulative typeetoken ratios and the relative distributions of
lexical types will vary as a result of the lexical choices of the speaker or writer. It could be
argued that such choices are likely to be highly individual specific rather than reflections of
group membership or neuropsychological condition. Stylometric analysis has certainly been
successful in distinguishing the work of two individuals, but its sensitivity to distinctions at
group level e century, sex, (English-speaking) country of birth e attest to collective as well as
individual influences.
Of course it does not follow automatically from this that the presence or absence of
degenerative neuropathology delineates a ‘group’ in the same sense, though this is an empirical
question that remains to be resolved. It also remains to be seen whether the power that auto-
mated stylometric analysis derives from being applied to literary texts many thousands of words
in length is sufficient to deal with the very much smaller samples that are usually produced in
the course of day-to-day life. If degenerative cognitive decline does have a stylometric
‘signature’ and descriptive methods are available to detect it, then the scope for further insights
into the origins and natural history of these common and devastating disorders will be
considerably enhanced.
