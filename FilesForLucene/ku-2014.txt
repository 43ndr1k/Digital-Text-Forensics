Understanding specific patterns or knowledge of self-
disclosing health information could support public
health surveillance and healthcare. This study aimed
to develop an analytical framework to identify self-
disclosing health information with unusual messages
on web forums by leveraging advanced text-mining
techniques. To demonstrate the performance of the pro-
posed analytical framework, we conducted an experi-
mental study on 2 major human immunodeficiency virus
(HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)
forums in Taiwan. The experimental results show that
the classification accuracy increased significantly (up to
83.83%) when using features selected by the information
gain technique. The results also show the importance of
adopting domain-specific features in analyzing unusual
messages on web forums. This study has practical
implications for the prevention and support of HIV/AIDS
healthcare. For example, public health agencies can
re-allocate resources and deliver services to people who
need help via social media sites. In addition, individuals
can also join a social media site to get better sugges-
tions and support from each other.
Introduction
With advances in information technology, social media
phenomena have created an abundance of user-generated
content from various online sites (Lim, Chen, & Chen,
2013). More and more self-disclosing health information
has been emerging and accumulating as text-based data in
online communities (e.g., web logs [blogs] and web
forums). Individuals can self-disclose and discuss their
health circumstances, such as the experience of coping with
a disease and specific disease conditions, questions, psycho-
logical anxiety, treatments, and so forth (Morris, Drake,
Saarimaki, Bennett, & O’Connor, 2008; Turner, Grube, &
Meyers, 2001). The purpose of self-disclosing health infor-
mation is not only for information exchange but also for
seeking help with healthcare decisions and alternative points
of view (Ybarra & Suman, 2006). When a person starts to
disclose information about himself/herself, others are
encouraged to do the same (de Valck, van Bruggen, &
Wierenga, 2009; Henderson & Gilding, 2004; Schau &
Gilly, 2003). Those kinds of data have increasingly become
a preferred source of information on personal health and can
be a valuable resource for healthcare practice (Boulos &
Wheeler, 2007; Lemire, Paré, Sicotte, & Harvey, 2008;
Stange, 2006).

Individuals can self-disclose their sensitive health infor-
mation (e.g., infection with human immunodeficiency virus
[HIV]/acquired immune deficiency syndrome [AIDS]1 or
other sexually transmitted diseases [STDs]) on the web and
ask for help rather than exposing themselves to an in-person
interview in official healthcare organizations (Flicker,
Goldberg, et al., 2004). Most self-disclosing health informa-
tion is usual and does not need further intervention. However,
as illustrated in Figure 1, some self-disclosing health infor-
mation involves unusual messages that reveal specific symp-
toms and circumstances, such as personal behaviors relating
to the contracting of stigmatized diseases, negative psycho-
logical status, specific and unknown symptoms of breaking
illnesses, desperate clinical experiences, informal knowledge
of treatments, and so forth. There may be risk concerns with
this information since the individual may be unaware of the
severity of his/her own circumstance and illness, resulting in
a delay in seeking clinical treatments and support. Therefore,
self-disclosing health information with unusual messages
needs to be monitored.
Existing studies have indicated that those individuals
who are, or suspect they are, infected with HIV/AIDS or
other STDs usually rely on personal relationships to obtain
supporting health information and further services (Veinot,
2009). Little research attention has been paid to how they
can obtain viable assistance online. Furthermore, despite the
growing research interest in collaborative information-
seeking and information-sharing via the Internet, quality and
reliability issues still exist with respect to online health-
related information (Abbott, 2010). In online communities,
there are agencies, social support groups, and trained volun-
teers that monitor self-disclosing health information with
unusual messages, and they are willing to share additional
information and support. If the self-disclosing health infor-
mation with unusual messages can be identified, proper
intervention, including consultation and assistance, can then
be provided. However, due to limited qualified manpower
and the lack of automatic surveillance mechanisms, search-
ing, identifying, and intervening with such information is
very labor-intensive and time-consuming, and unsustainable
in the long run. Thus, there is a need to adopt more effective
and efficient supporting mechanisms than the manual
approach. This has motivated our research in proposing a
more advanced and automatic approach to address the
problem.
Developing automated tools to identify and classify
self-disclosing health information with unusual messages
could help avoid or reduce negative impacts on public
health. To the best of our knowledge, there is no previous
study identifying this kind of information for public health
surveillance and healthcare. In this research, we investigate
the role of online platforms (specifically web forums) and
aim to develop an analytical framework by leveraging
advanced text mining techniques to automatically identify
self-disclosing health information with unusual messages.
HIV/AIDS is one of the diseases that greatly concerns the
public. However, the prevention and control of HIV/AIDS
are still challenges in many countries (such as Taiwan).
According to statistical reports from the Taiwan Centers for
Disease Control (CDC) about the accumulating cases in
2012, a total of 25,081 cases of HIV were reported and 3,771
1Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a virus and acquired immune
deficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a disease caused by HIV. People typically
use these two terms together, and treat them interchangeably in most cases.
Thus, we do not intend to differentiate them in this paper.

Summary Content:
I had bareback sex with a Net friend in early August. I feel sore throat, sometime
better and sometime worse. I also feel elbow pain and tightness in the chest. I 
do not have a fever or eruption and enlargement of lymph nodes. But I am so scared.
Note: the unusual messages are marked in bold font, such as sexual risk behaviors (e.g., bareback 
sex with a Net friend), uncertain symptoms (e.g., feel sore throat, sometimes better and sometimes 
worse, elbow pain and tightness in the chest), and negative status of personal mind (e.g., I am so 
scared).

deaths from HIV/AIDS.2 If the rate of HIV/AIDS infection
continues to rise, Taiwan will face tremendous socioeco-
nomic burdens of about US $6.84 billion by the year 2020
(Twu, Huang, Lai, Ming, & Su, 2004). The estimates for
unreported HIV/AIDS infection are even higher than
those for HIV/AIDS. More effective efforts are needed
to identify potential or unreported HIV-infected people
and help link them to the supporting healthcare agencies. In
this study, two major HIV/AIDS forums in Taiwan were
used as the experimental sites to demonstrate the feasibility
of the proposed analytical framework in identifying
self-disclosing health information with unusual messages.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. We
present an overview of the literature about health data and
self-disclosing health information and text mining tech-
niques, and then describe the research gaps and our ques-
tions. Next, we describe the proposed analytical framework
and the experimental design and results. Finally, we deliver
our conclusions and a brief discourse on future research
directions.
Literature Review
Health Data and Self-Disclosing Health Information in
Web Forums
In medical practice, health data are used for the purpose
of syndromic surveillance, medical knowledge sharing, and
supporting healthcare. One major type of health data are
clinical data that come from hospitals, clinics, chief com-
plaint records, laboratory data, or triage nurse calls. These
type of data were generated by nurses, specialists, and labo-
ratory technologists and can be used as early warnings for
specific diseases (Buckeridge, 2007; Buehler, Hopkins,
Overhage, Sosin, & Tong, 2004; Chen, Zeng, & Yan, 2010;
Lu et al., 2009). The other type of health data are Internet
data, which are increasingly becoming a preferred source
and particularly contribute to healthcare practice, such as
Internet news, blogs, medical Q&A portals, and wikis
(Boulos & Wheeler, 2007; Lemire et al., 2008; McLean,
Richards, & Wardman, 2007). As shown in Tables 1 and 2,
previous studies can be characterized based on their research
goal, data type, data format, and their application domains.
For the research goal, most studies have focused on early
warnings for syndromic surveillance and disease outbreaks
(G1), but few studies have paid attention to the other goal:
knowledge collaboration and sharing (G2) and supporting
healthcare (G3). In terms of adopting health data, the major-
ity of previous studies adopted terminology-related clinic
data (S1, DF1) and case-driven Internet news (S2, DF2). The
content of those data sources is well-structured and clearly
organized in format and display. However, few studies have
addressed data on medical Q&A portals, blogs, and web
forums. The content of those data sources is written by
individuals using personal writing styles and could be dif-
ferent in format and display (e.g., the organization of content
is unstructured).
For the web forum, self-disclosing health information is
formed as a thread with the postings. One page contains
many threads and each thread is composed of the starting
posting and the following postings. Each thread represents
self-disclosing health information of personal circum-
stances. More importantly, the starting posting presents the
main theme of the thread. Some of the self-disclosing health
information postings with unusual messages contain infor-
mation that should be cause for concern and therefore inter-
vention by public health agencies because those postings
may indicate potential health risks. However, to the best of
our knowledge, there is no feasible mechanism in previous
research for the identification of those postings from web
forums for public health surveillance and healthcare.
Self-disclosing health information on web forums is
common when individuals search for free access to health
information and social support, particularly when there is no
ready access to health providers, as well as health and fitness
assessment (Song & Zahedi, 2007). Web forums also
encourage the behavior of self-disclosing health information
because of its anonymity, privacy, collaborative knowledge,
and social support (Denecke & Nejdl, 2009; Joinson, 2001;
Tichon & Shapiro, 2003). As a result, self-disclosing health
information is more easily accumulated on web forums,
which disclose revealing health information about personal
behavioral patterns and disease symptoms that can link to
individuals’ needs (Boulos & Wheeler, 2007; Stange, 2006;
Turner, Grube, & Meyers, 2001).

Two types of web forums can be used to obtain self-
disclosing health information: forums for collaborative
knowledge-sharing (Cress & Kimmerle, 2008; Sutanto,
Kankanhalli, & Tan, 2011) and forums for social support
(Davison, Pennebaker, & Dickerson, 2000; Eysenbach,
Powell, Englesakis, Rizo, & Stern, 2004). In collaborative
knowledge-sharing forums, participants disclose information
or facilitate knowledge-sharing with the public. This type
of forum mostly focuses on providing participants with more
knowledge about how to prevent certain diseases, sharing
experience interactively, and dealing with personal circum-
stances. Examples of such forums are the World Health
Organization–International Food Safety Authorities Net-
work (WHO-INFOSAN; http://www.who.int/foodsafety/
fs_management/infosan/en), and Yahoo! Knowledge (http://
tw.dictionary.yahoo.com); the latter aims at disclosing
personal health matters to a specific social support forum
to obtain health suggestions and consultation. Some forums
may have infectious disease specialists and trained
volunteers reviewing the information and providing the
participants comments and suggestions for social support
resources and coping with stress and disease. For example,
the RUsick2 Foodborne Disease Forum (http://www
.rusick2.msu.edu) for sudden onset vomiting or diarrhea, and
the Taiwan AIDS Foundation (http://www.taiwanaids
.org.tw) for helping AIDS patients obtain the proper care (see
Figure 2).
Text-Mining Techniques
In healthcare practice, prior to clinic visits or laboratory
confirmation of disease and symptoms, individuals may
seek help by submitting their self-disclosing health informa-
tion with circumstances of behavioral patterns, symptoms,
or signs to web forums (Mandl et al., 2004). Self-disclosing
health information is a type of accessible text-based data.
Generally, text-mining techniques can be used to automati-
cally and efficiently analyze the text-based data. Exploring
text-based data usually includes the following phases: data
acquisition, feature generation and text representation,
classification, and evaluation (Huang, Fu, & Chen, 2010;
Schumaker & Chen, 2008, 2009; Zhang, Dang, Chen,
Thurmond, & Larson, 2009).
In the data acquisition phase, the self-disclosing health
information is collected from target pages by an incremental
web crawler program (or spidering tool). Usually, the
crawler programs exploit the graph structure of the web by
fetching from a seed page and then following the hyperlinks
in it to get other pages until a sufficient number of pages or
certain higher-level objective is reached (Pant & Srinivasan,
2005). To search the matched pages in a specific domain,
vertical search engines are often used by keeping indexes
only in the domain (Chau & Chen, 2003). In addition,
adding intelligence (heuristics) into crawling strategies can
also improve the performance of collecting relevant pages
(Pant & Srinivasan, 2005; Zhang, Zeng, Li, Wang, & Zuo,
2009).
For the feature generation and text representation phase,
features of each text document (e.g., each collected self-
disclosing health information is regarded as a text document
in this study) can be generated based on different text rep-
resentation approaches, such as bag-of-words, word/part of
speech (POS), or manually-annotated domain-specific fea-
tures. Bag-of-words is a commonly used indexing approach
that treats a text document as a collection of words. This
approach ignores grammatical constructs and is used to gen-
erate simple nature and suitable features to represent the
document (Ngo-Ye & Sinha, 2012; Schumaker & Chen,
2009). In the bag-of-words representation, the text docu-
ment is encoded as a feature vector; each element in the
vector indicates the presence or absence of a word in the
document (Conway, Doan, Kawazoe, & Collier, 2009; Finn,
Kushmerick, & Smyth, 2002). Word/part-of-speech
(denoted as word/POS) is a useful approach to capture the
syntactic and semantic information on words by using the
POS tags (Kanejiya, Kumar, & Prasad, 2003; Padó &
Lapata, 2007). The feature is a tag of morphosyntactic
information based on contextual information that includes
adjective, noun, adverb, and verb (Stamatatos, 2009).
Domain-specific features are annotated manually and

subjectively based on domain knowledge to provide the
guided keywords in specific domains (Finn et al., 2002).
However, no matter what kinds of representation approaches
are used, noisy, redundant, irrelevant, or misleading features
are inevitably generated at the same time. Feeding these
features into a model often results in overfitting and poor
predictions (Meiri & Zahavi, 2006). Therefore, effective
feature selection can improve the scalability, efficiency, and
accuracy; for example, document frequencies (DF), infor-
mation gain (IG), mutual information (MI), χ2-test (CHI),
term strength (TS), and so forth. IG has been used in many
text mining studies and is treated as an efficient approach for
text feature selection (Abbasi, Chen, & Nunamaker, 2008;
Aghdam, Ghasem-Aghaee, & Basiri, 2009; Koppel &
Schler, 2003). It is one of the most effective and widely
adopted approaches for feature selection in text classifica-
tion (Aghdam et al., 2009; Yang & Pedersen, 1997).
In the classification and evaluation phase, each document
comprises a set of features and is automatically assigned
category information (e.g., “yes” or “no”; “usual” or
“unusual”) by the trained classifier. The trained classifier is
built by classification approaches that learn the characteris-
tics of the categories from a set of preclassified documents
(Sebastiani, 2002). For the classification tasks, the support
vector machine (SVM) and naïve Bayes (NB) algorithms are
widely used classification approaches for text mining.
Both of them have been shown as effective in achieving
a high level of classification accuracy in the literature
(Aphinyanaphongs, Tsamardinos, Statnikov, Hardin, &
Aliferis, 2005; Chapman, Dowling, & Wagner, 2004;
McCowan et al., 2007; Muscatello et al., 2005; Ong,
Magrabi, & Coiera, 2012; Pakhomov, Hanson, Bjornsen, &
Smith, 2008; Zhang, Dang, et al., 2009). The SVM is
usually used to find a linear decision boundary that maxi-
mizes the widest possible margin between two classes in this
space (Lin & Wang, 2002). Two characteristics make SVM
efficient for classification tasks: (a) prior knowledge is
not required; and (b) small samples can also yield better
classification performance with a global optimal solution
(Figueroa, Zeng-Treitler, Kandula, & Ngo, 2012). Different
from SVM, NB is a probabilistic classifier and uses the
feature values of a new instance to estimate the probability
of each category. Text classifier based on NB has been
popular because of its simplicity. However, the insufficient
number of training examples may influence its classification
performance (Kim, Han, Rim, & Myaeng, 2006). When
comparing the classification performance of SVM and NB,
the average accuracy of SVM is slightly higher (Huang &
Ling, 2005). However, NB may outperform SVM while
considering the simplicity of the model architecture and
computational efficiency (Kim et al., 2006).
As shown in Table 3 and Table 4, this study provides
the taxonomy of technique perspectives and summary of
prior studies on feature types, data sources, and mining
approaches. Most studies applied domain-specific features
in extracting the data of medical systems, clinical records,
or chief complaints. There is an increase in exploring
Internet data. In addition, most studies applied the SVM
and NB algorithms to conduct their experiments for
diseases detection and healthcare surveillance. However,
little attention has been paid to exploring the self-
disclosing health information with unusual messages that
are also important Internet data for public health
surveillance.
Research Gaps and Questions
Based on our survey of previous studies, individuals may
prefer to disclose their sensitive health information on
the web rather than exposing themselves to an in-person
interview in official healthcare organizations. However,
little research attention has been paid to identifying self-
disclosing health information with unusual messages that
indicate potential health concerns and where intervention
could take place in the web forum. Searching for, identify-
ing, and intervening with such information is labor-intensive
and time consuming. However, due to limited qualified man-
power, it is not sustainable to perform such work manually
in the long run. Therefore, this study aims to examine
whether adopting text mining techniques can be used to
automatically identify the self-disclosing health information
with unusual messages more effectively and efficiently. This
leads to our first research question.

RQ1: Can text mining techniques be used to identify self-
disclosing health information with unusual messages in web
forums?
In addition, domain-specific features could be used to iden-
tify the domain-specific and relevant circumstances from
self-disclosing health information in public health surveil-
lance and healthcare. Thus, leveraging advanced text repre-
sentation and feature selection methods to effectively extract
domain-specific features is very important. In this study, we
examined whether using more types of features generated
by automatic text representation approaches could help
improve the performance of identifying the self-disclosing
health information with unusual messages. This leads to the
second research question.
RQ2: Can classification performance on identifying the self-
disclosing health information with unusual messages be
improved when incorporating features generated by using
automatic text representation approaches with domain-
specific features?
Further, since “collaborative knowledge sharing” and
“social support” are two major types of public health ser-
vices, understanding their individual roles and nature could
help participants better fit in the related forums to easily
meet their needs. Therefore, exploring the difference
between the collaborative knowledge sharing forum and the
social support forum is meaningful not only for participants
to find an appropriate site to convey their needs for better
support, but also for public health agencies and service
groups to evaluate their supporting and service goals. This
leads to our third research question.
RQ3: What are the context differences between the collab-
orative knowledge-sharing forum and the social support
forum in the AIDS support domain?
System Design
This study aims to develop an analytical framework
with text mining techniques to identify the self-
disclosing health information with unusual messages
in web forums. Two major HIV/AIDS forums in Taiwan
were used as our case study to demonstrate the feasibility
of the proposed framework. As an illustration, in
Figure 3, the proposed analytical framework contains
three components: (a) data acquisition; (b) feature genera-
tion and text representation; and (c) classification and
evaluation.
Before the data acquisition, the ethics issues surround-
ing the information should be considered. We collected
data from open web forums and therefore any ethical
issues with regard to our subjects are not applicable for
this study. The data collected came from open web forums
that did not require a subscription to view, download, or
analyze the information. It was considered to be in the
public domain, and ethical approval from individuals is not
essential (Eysenbach & Till, 2001; Flicker, Haans, &
Skinner, 2004; Mo & Coulson, 2008; Sudweeks & Rafaeli,
1996). For the data acquisition, the crawler program is
used to collect raw HTML pages from the selected web
forums automatically. All HTML tags will be filtered out
by the parsing program tailored to the particular format.
The redundant and irrelevant information needs to be
cleaned out before the collected data are stored into the
collection.
Unlike English, Chinese does not have space to separate
words in sentences; therefore, text needs to be segmented for
feature generation and text representation component. When
dealing with Chinese content, an efficient Chinese segmen-
tation tool is needed. The Stanford Word Segmenter was

used as a segmentation tool whose core engine is based on
the conditional random field (CRF) (Tseng, Chang, Andrew,
Jurafsky, & Manning, 2005). The Stanford Word Segmenter
is a simplified Chinese-based word parsing tool and the
selected forums are traditional Chinese-based content. The
step of converting the crawled Chinese content from tradi-
tional Chinese to simplified Chinese is needed.3 The
Stanford Word Segmenter provides either CTB (Chinese
Penn Treebank standard) or PKU (Peking University stan-
dard) models as an option while implementing the segmen-
tation process. The segmented simplified Chinese output is
then re-converted to traditional Chinese. In the preliminary
analysis, we tested the 100 randomly selected postings of
self-disclosing health information from two testbeds sepa-
rately. The Stanford Word Segmenter with the CTB model
can achieve 80.98% and 82.42% accuracy in extracting
Chinese terms from the selected Yahoo! Knowledge and
Taiwan AIDS Foundation testbeds, respectively. The accu-
racy is based on the matching rate in terms of the official
Chinese dictionary4 published by the Ministry of Education
in Taiwan. Since most of the extracted Chinese terms are
practically sound, we adopted the matched Chinese terms as
word-level features and the remains are split into character-
level features.

In the feature generation and text representation compo-
nent, several feature sets were constructed by different text
representation approaches in the following.
The Bag-of-Words Feature Set (Denoted as bag-of-words)
In this study, we adopted the standard bag-of-words to get
the unigrams and bigrams of features. We used the
character-level and word-level features as the unigram and
bigram features, respectively.
The Word/Part of Speech Feature Set (Denoted as
word/POS)
For the word/part of speech, each feature has its syntactic
tag and we regard each word-level feature with its syntactic
tag as one feature that the two to four Chinese words in
length are considered. We adopted the Stanford POS tagger5
to create each word/POS pair as one feature set, which
is consistent with prior work in Zhang, Zeng,
et al. (2009), such as “性工作者/NN (sex worker),”
“一夜情/NN (one night stand).” In addition, the word/POS
pair may be a compound word and can actually constitute a
noun phrase in Chinese (Lin & Gao, 2008), such as
“感染/VV 愛滋/NN (infect AIDS).”
The Stanford POS tagger was built using the maximum
entropy model with improved tagging speed, performance,
usability, and multilingual function (e.g., English, Arabic,
Chinese, and German) (Toutanova, Klein, Manning, &
Singer, 2003; Toutanova & Manning, 2000).
The Combination of Bag-of-Words and Word/POS
(Denoted as bag-of-words+word/POS)
This feature set incorporates bag-of-words and word/
POS.
The Selected Bag-of-Words+Word/POS (Denoted as
selected bag-of-words+word/POS)
Selected bag-of-words+word/POS is the selected feature
set after applying information gain as feature selection
approach in bag-of-words+word/POS. For information gain,
we used the Shannon entropy measure (Shannon, 1948,
2001) in which:
IG C T H C H C T, |( ) = ( ) − ( )
where:
IG(C, T) is the information gain of feature T;
H C p C i p C i
i
n
( ) = − =( ) =( )
=
∑ log2
1
is the entropy across
message category;
H C T p C i T p C i T
i
n
| | log |( ) = − =( ) =( )
=
∑ 2
1
is the specific
feature conditional entropy; and n is the total number of
information category.
The self-disclosing health information is classified into
two categories (e.g., “usual” or “unusual”). If the amount
of self-disclosed information in both categories is equal,
then H(C) is 1. Otherwise, the information gain for
each feature T varies along the range 0–1, with higher
IG values indicating better ability to distinguish the
self-disclosing health information with unusual messages
from those without unusual messages. All features with
an information gain greater than 0.0025 (i.e.,
IG(C,T) > 0.0025) are selected. The use of such a threshold
is consistent with prior work using IG for text features
selection (Abbasi, Chen, & Salem, 2008; Yang &
Pedersen, 1997).
Domain-Specific Feature Set (Denoted as DSF)
As shown in Table 5, DSF is a domain-specific feature set
manually annotated from the HIV/AIDS Q&A instructions
on the CDC website in Taiwan.6 The HIV/AIDS Q&A
instructions include the most common HIV/AIDS questions
and corresponding answers and the DSF provides the guided
keywords on AIDS Q&A domain.
In the classification and evaluation component, the
SVM and NB algorithms are used to conduct the classifi-
cation task based on text features. A tenfold cross-
validation strategy is used to evaluate the ability of the
trained classifier. The results are using the conventional
accuracy and F-measure metrics to evaluate performance
(Fawcett, 2006; Zhang, Dang, et al., 2009; Zheng, Li,
Chen, & Huang, 2006). Accuracy is the percentage of cor-
rectly classified self-disclosing health information that is
defined as the number of correctly classified self-disclosing
health information items (e.g., the information preclassi-
fied as “unusual” and the classifier also classified it as
“unusual”; the information preclassified as “usual” and the
classifier also classified it as “usual”) divided by the total
number of self-disclosing health information items.
F-measure is an evenly weighted harmonic mean of preci-
sion and recall. A contingency table is used to perform
calculations (see Table 6). Accuracy and F-measure are
defined (respectively) in Equations 1 and 2.

Case Study: HIV/AIDS–Related Self-Disclosing
Health Information
Testbeds
Since HIV/AIDS is still stigmatized in Taiwan, the esti-
mates for unreported HIV/AIDS infection are higher than
those for HIV/AIDS. People with stigmatized illnesses often
avoid seeking official healthcare which makes the Internet a
useful health information and outreach tool for this group
(Berger, Wagner, & Baker, 2005). However, the fact may
result in the delay of official diagnosis to initiate HIV/AIDS
treatment before the virus significantly damages the immune
system and then becomes an unreported case. Therefore,
more effective efforts are needed to identify potentially or
unreported HIV-infected people and help connect them with
healthcare services. This study uses two typical and the most
popular HIV/AIDS forums in Taiwan as a case study
to demonstrate how the proposed framework works: Yahoo!
Knowledge is the biggest collaborative knowledge-sharing
forum in Taiwan and the Taiwan AIDS Foundation forum is
the first officially funded forum for HIV/AIDS social
support. Both account for the major forums about HIV/
AIDS discussion in Taiwan.
Generally, in the web forum structure, the self-disclosing
health information is formed as threads with detailed

postings. On a web form page, there could be many threads,
each of which is composed of the initial posting and follow-
ing postings. Each thread represents a piece of self-
disclosing health information of personal circumstances.
More importantly, the initial posting presents the main
theme of the thread, and the other following postings are all
about suggestions made to the starting posting. Thus, the
following postings are not that important to our study.
Therefore, this study only focuses on initial postings (as
self-disclosing health information) and to examine whether
they contain unusual messages with specific circumstances
that should cause concern and intervention by public health
agencies. The Offline Explorer7 is used to retrieve the
threads with their related postings on the pages in both
forums based on the depth-first search strategy. Links point-
ing to pages outside a given forum were discarded. For the
sample size, totally, we found 670 starting postings from the
Yahoo! Knowledge forum and 538 initial postings from
the Taiwan AIDS Foundation forum. The sample size is
statistically large enough to conduct the analysis. Detailed
information about the testbeds is provided in Table 7.
Yahoo! Knowledge.8 Yahoo! Knowledge is the biggest col-
laborative knowledge-sharing web forum in Taiwan where
users can post health questions and others can discuss and
share their experience as answers. The best answer to the
question emerges through users’ voting. The keywords (i.e.,
HIV, AIDS, and 愛滋 [AIDS]) have been used for crawling
HIV/AIDS-related postings of self-disclosing health infor-
mation from the public health category of Yahoo! Knowl-
edge. The redundant and irrelevant postings, AIDS reports,
and news were removed first. The published time of col-
lected postings from the Yahoo! Knowledge is from January
1, 2007 to September 29, 2009.
Taiwan AIDS Foundation.9 The Taiwan AIDS Foundation
provides a web forum that allows people who are, or suspect
they are, infected with HIV/AIDS or other STDs to post
their questions and concerns. The Taiwan AIDS Foundation
forum is the first officially funded forum for HIV/AIDS
social support. The clinic doctors and volunteers are
scheduled in turn to monitor and reply to the online
HIV/AIDS inquiries. All the postings of self-disclosing
health information in the Taiwan AIDS Foundation forum
are by default associated with the HIV/AIDS issues and
collected. Postings from the Taiwan AIDS Foundation
forum were collected from May 27, 2009 to October 11,
2009.

mation to each posting of self-disclosing health information

and to estimate the classification performance of the trained
classifier. The preclassified coding is used to manually
classify the postings with unusual messages that reveal the
specific circumstances. In our case study, the posting is
labeled as “unusual” when the posting contains unusual
messages (e.g., sexual risk behaviors, uncertain symptoms,
misleading treatments, negative psychological status) that
needs to be early-warned. Otherwise, it is labeled as “usual”
when the posting is general posting. To assess interrater
reliability of the preclassified coding, two domain experts
were invited to do the coding tasks in this study. The first
domain expert is a faculty member working at counseling
center at the Central Police University, Taiwan, with more
than 8 years experience on sexual bias correction, homo-
sexuality support, counseling, and psychological condition
pre-warning. The second domain expert is a social worker
in the Taiwan Tongzhi Hotline Association who has more
than 5 years of experience in homosexuality support, AIDS
and sexual risk behavior counseling, and safe sex counsel-
ing. Both of them are professionally qualified to conduct
the coding tasks. We obtained Kappa values of 86.18%
from the Yahoo! Knowledge testbed and 93.28% from the
Taiwan AIDS Foundation testbed. Differences in the pre-
classified coding between the two domain experts were
discussed to determine categories. Finally, 259 of 670
postings are with unusual messages in the Yahoo! Knowl-
edge testbed and 258 of 538 postings are with unusual
messages in the Taiwan AIDS Foundation testbed. The fol-
lowing are examples postings denoted as “unusual” or

Hypotheses
Based on the proposed analytical framework, several
feature sets were generated by applying different text repre-
sentation approaches: bag-of-words, word/POS, bag-of-
words+word/POS, selected bag-of-words+word/POS, and
DSF. In order to address the research questions, we devel-
oped the following hypotheses.
First, we aimed to compare the performance between
different feature sets combined with powerful machine-
learning approaches for the classification task in identifying
the postings of self-disclosing health information with
unusual messages. We assigned DSF as baseline feature set
since this set is manually created by the two domain experts
from the HIV/AIDS Q&A instructions on the CDC website
in Taiwan. bag-of-words+word/POS is the combination of
bag-of-words and word/POS, both of which are automati-
cally generated rich feature sets. Therefore, we posited the
use of bag-of-words+word/POS can achieve better perfor-
mance in both accuracy and F-measure than the use of DSF.
In addition, feature selection can often improve the text
classification performance. Therefore, we also posit that the
new feature set (i.e., selected bag-of-words+eord/POS) gen-
erated by applying information gain feature selection
method on bag-of-words+word/POS can achieve better per-
formance in accuracy and F-measure than the use of bag-
of-words+word/POS.
H1: The use of bag-of-words+word/POS outperforms the use
of DSF in identifying the postings of self-disclosing health
information with unusual messages. Furthermore, the use of
selected bag-of-words+word/POS outperforms the use of
bag-of-words+word/POS in identifying the postings with
unusual messages.
H1a: bag-of-words+word/POS > DSF.
H1b: selected bag-of-words+word/POS > bag-of-words+
word/POS.
Second, manual coding of DSF has led to promising results
for the classification task in identifying the postings with
unusual messages. However, the manual DSF is limited in
overlooking some very important features. We aimed to
compare the performance of the improved DSF with the
DSF for the classification task. We merge the features of
selected bag-of-words+word/POS into the DSF as improved

DOI: 10.1002/asi
DSF (i.e., selected bag-of-words+word/POS and DSF,
denoted as Improved_DSF) and posit the use of
Improved_DSF can achieve better performance in accuracy
and F-measures than the use of DSF.
H2: The use of Improved_DSF outperforms the use of DSF
in identifying the self-disclosing health information with
unusual messages.
H2: Improved_DSF > DSF.
Experimental Results and Discussions
This study proposed an analytical framework with text-
mining techniques to identify the self-disclosing health
information with unusual messages in web forums. In our
experiments, several feature sets were generated from
the collected postings by different text representation
approaches. The SVM and NB algorithms were used for
training the classifier to identify the postings with the
unusual messages. A tenfold cross-validation strategy was
implemented using the WEKA data mining tool with default
parameter settings for the all experiments (Hall et al., 2009).
Pairwise t tests were conducted by randomly splitting the
data set 100 times with 90% of the data used for training and
the remaining 10% for testing. The p values with *, **, and
*** indicate significant differences at the levels of α = .05,
α = .01, and α = .001, respectively.
Features Comparison
For each feature set (bag-of-words, word/POS, bag-of-
words+word/POS, selected bag-of-words+word/POS, and
DSF) with the SVM and NB classifiers, we provide the
performance measures and the results of statistical analysis in
Table 8, where the values in bold denote the best perfor-
mance. As we can see from the table, DSF is the baseline in
this study that can be used to identify the postings with
unusual messages. The accuracies for theYahoo! Knowledge
testbed is 66.87% and for Taiwan AIDS Foundation testbed
is 71.93%. However, bag-of-words+word/POS performs
better than DSF. After applying information gain as feature
selection approach, selected bag-of-words+word/POS
performs better than bag-of-words+word/POS for the
classification tasks with the accuracies of 75.07% in the
Yahoo! Knowledge testbed and 83.83% in the Taiwan
AIDS Foundation testbed. The p values of the t test, with
significant differences at the α = .01 and α = .001 levels, also
support these comparison results. The results show that fea-
tures selected by information gain can improve the classifi-
cation results significantly. Therefore, Hypothesis 1 is
supported.
Feature set selected bag-of-words+word/POS is gener-
ated by conducting information gain (IG) on bag-of-
words+word/POS. IG improves the classification accuracy
because the selected features are likely the most significant
discriminators with the least redundancy to differentiate
the postings with unusual messages against all others.
Information gain measures the presence or absence of a
feature in the posting that is normally used to deal with a
binary classification problem (Yang & Pedersen, 1997).
Each feature has its corresponding IG value. It depends on
the given threshold to determine the number of features.
Therefore, a threshold with a higher IG value will bring
out fewer features that may have greater discriminatory
contribution to the classification, while a threshold with a
lower IG value will provide more features to help maintain
the diversity balance. Such balance is important to avoid
premature convergence of the solution toward local
maxima (Abbasi, Chen, & Salem, 2008; Aggarwal, Orlin,
& Tai, 1997). Previous research showed that features
selected by IG can achieve the best performance (Abbasi,
Chen, & Salem, 2008). The limitations of information gain
include: its bias toward features split in multiple classes
(Cover & Thomas, 1991); it requires a relatively complete
data set to help choose the right features for the classifi-
cation model (Ning & Jajodia, 2004); and it does not rec-
ognize the location of the occurrences of the features in the
document (Esmaeili & Gabor, 2010). Since this study deals
with a binary classification problem (i.e., “usual” or
“unusual”) and the sample size is statistically large enough
to conduct the analysis, the first two limitations have little
impact on our results. In addition, there is no perfect
feature selection method and IG is one of the best based on
its performance reported in the literature (Aghdam et al.,
2009; Wang, Morgan, Zhang, Sette, & Peters, 2007; Yang
& Pedersen, 1997).
Extracting Useful Keywords as Features for Improving the
Classification Ability of DSF
Selected bag-of-words+word/POS are the features
selected by information gain that performs well in the clas-
sification tasks. We obtained 337 features from the Yahoo!
Knowledge testbed and 304 features from the Taiwan AIDS
Foundation testbed. We list the top 20% semantically mean-
ingful features from selected bag-of-words+word/POS in
Table 9. The features from selected bag-of-words+word/
POS can be grouped into three types (illustrated in
Figure 4): core features; shared features; and context-
dependent features.
• Core features (7 features): The features appear in both test-
beds and are DSF.
• Shared features (67 features): The features appear in both
testbeds but are not DSF.
• Context-dependent features (263 features in the Yahoo!
Knowledge testbed and 230 features in the Taiwan AIDS
Foundation testbed): The features belong to their own test-
beds and have specific meaning to their own forums.
In Figure 4, seven core features belong to DSF: “口腔
(the oral cavity),” “危險 (dangerous),” “行為 (behavior),”
“性行為 (sex behavior),” “射精 (ejaculate),” “陰道
(vagina),” and “嫖妓 (soliciting prostitutes).” These features
are often used keywords in HIV/AIDS prevention and Q&A

instructions. Sixty-seven shared features can be found both
in the Yahoo! Knowledge and the Taiwan AIDS Foundation
testbeds. In Table 10, we report the performance measures
and the results of statistical analysis to examine whether
shared features can improve the classification performance,
where the values in bold denote the best performance. DSF
represents domain-specific features and Improved_DSF rep-
resents shared features incorporated into the existing DSF to
improve the identification of the postings with unusual mes-
sages. It can be seen from the table when shared features
were incorporated into the domain-specific features, the
accuracy improved from 66.87% to 70.60% in the Yahoo!
Knowledge testbed and from 71.93% to 75.46% in the
Taiwan AIDS Foundation testbed. The p values of the t test
are significant at the α = .001 level, supporting Hypothesis
2. DSF may have limitation on identification task because it
comes from manually annotated; whereas shared features
yields more useful keywords to improve this limitation of
DSF.
Implications of Context-Dependent Features
In this section, we further group the context-dependent
features into four categories based on the their semantic
meanings. These four categories have managerial implica-
tions for understanding HIV/AIDS-related self-disclosing
health information: mental status, symptoms, behaviors, and
self-diagnosis and help. Figure 5 illustrates the distribution
comparison of context-dependent features between the
Yahoo! Knowledge testbed and the Taiwan AIDS Founda-
tion testbed.
As shown in Figure 5, the Yahoo! Knowledge testbed
has a higher percentage of HIV/AIDS discussions on
“behaviors” whereas the Taiwan AIDS Foundation testbed
has higher percentage of HIV/AIDS discussions on “self-
diagnosis and help,” “symptoms,” and “mental status.” The
result also indicates the differences in the discussions of
HIV/AIDS related issues between the context of a collab-
orative knowledge-sharing forum and a social support
forum. The HIV/AIDS-related self-disclosing health infor-
mation in the Yahoo! Knowledge testbed often presents the
discussion on what behaviors to cause the HIV/AIDS infec-
tion, misconceptions to HIV/AIDS, and weird symptoms
after risky sexual behaviors. In the Taiwan AIDS Founda-
tion testbed, the HIV/AIDS-related self-disclosing health
information often provides information on how to self-
diagnose after risky sexual behaviors and where to get help
for comforting the anxiety. The findings further suggest that
the culture and norm of the domain-specific web forums
can be different. This study has practical implications for
the prevention and support of HIV/AIDS healthcare. For
example, public health agencies can re-allocate the
resources and deliver the services to people who need help
via social media sites. In addition, individuals can also join
a social media site to get better suggestions and support
from each other.TA

Conclusions and Future Directions
Understanding specific patterns of self-disclosing health
information could support public health surveillance and
healthcare. This study presents an analytical framework to
identify self-disclosing health information with unusual
messages that reveal the specific and concerned circum-
stances in web forums. Two major HIV/AIDS forums in
Taiwan were used as our case study to demonstrate the
feasibility of the proposed framework. The results provide
insights into the effectiveness of applying text mining tech-
niques on HIV/AIDS-related self-disclosing health informa-
tion on web forums. This study has shown its promising
applicability to healthcare practice. We believe the proposed
framework can also be extended to study other self-
disclosing health information issues (e.g., suicide, weight
loss). Public health agencies and social support groups can
employ the proposed framework to create surveillance and
supporting healthcare strategies and also direct consultation
and support resources to people who need help.

Based on our proposed framework, an integrated public
health surveillance system could be implemented. We have
tried to determine how this study might be improved. This
might include aspects such as efficiency, privacy preserva-
tion, multilingual applicability, system promotion, severity
labeling of unusual messages, intervention follow-up track-
ing, end users feedback, and so forth. We believe these are
critical success factors of wider use. Additionally, this study
only adopted information gain as the approach to generate
selected feature sets. In addition to information gain, there
are other advanced feature selection methods such as docu-
ment frequencies and mutual information. Future research
could explore and compare the performance of different
feature selection methods in identifying online text-based
health information from social media.
