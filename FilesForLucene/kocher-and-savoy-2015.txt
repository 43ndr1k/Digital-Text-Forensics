Abstract. This paper describes and evaluates an unsupervised authorship 
verification model called SPATIUM-L1.  The suggested strategy can be adapted 
without any problem to different languages (such as Dutch, English, Greek, and 
Spanish) with their genre and topic differ significantly.  As features, we suggest 
using the k most frequent terms of the disputed text (isolated words and 
punctuation symbols with k may vary from 200 to 300).  Applying a simple 
distance measure and a set of impostors, we determine whether or not the 
disputed text was written by the proposed author.  Moreover, based on a simple 
rule, we can define when there is enough evidence to propose an answer with a 
high degree of confidence or when the attribution scheme is given without 
certainty.  The evaluations are based on four test collections (PAN AUTHOR
IDENTIFICATION task at CLEF 2015). 
1   Introduction 
Automatic authorship identification aims to determine, as accurately as possible, if 
the proposed author of a document or a text excerpt is the real one [9].  To achieve 
this, a sample of texts written by the proposed author and each of the possible 
impostors must be available.  The verification problem knows some interesting 
historical questions such as “are all the Letters of Paul written by the same person?”, 
“is President L. Johnson the real author of the 1964 State of the Union Address (just 
weeks after the assassination of Kennedy)?”, or “is Madison the true author of the 12 
disputed Federalist Papers?”.  With the Web 2.0 technologies, the number of 
anonymous or pseudonymous texts is increasing and in many cases we face a single 
possible author (e.g., is John the real author of this blog post or tweet?).  Therefore, 
proposing an effective algorithm to the verification problem presents a real interest.  A 
justification supporting the proposed answer and a probability that the given answer is 
correct can be given to improve the confidence attached to the response [6].  
This authorship verification question seems simpler than the classical authorship 
attribution problem, but it is not.  For example, if we want to know if a newly 
discovered poem was really written by Shakespeare [11], the computer needs to 
compare a model based on Shakespeare’s texts with all other possible representative 
non-Shakespeare models.  This second part is hard to generate.  Are we sure we have 
included all other writers having a style similar to Shakespeare?   
This paper is organized as follows.  The next section presents the test collections and 
the evaluation methodology used in the experiments.  The third section explains our 
proposed algorithm called SPATIUM-L1.  In the last section, we evaluate the proposed 
scheme and compare it to the best performing schemes using four different test 
collections.  A conclusion draws the main findings of this study. 
2   Test Collections and Evaluation Methodology 
The experiments supporting previous studies were usually limited to one language, 
one author, and one or a few texts.  For real cases, this limitation makes sense; for 
example we have only one newly discovered poem that might be attributed 
to Shakespeare [11].  To evaluate the effectiveness of a verification algorithm, the 
number of tests must however be larger.  To create such benchmarks, and to 
promote studies in this domain, the PAN CLEF evaluation campaign was 
launched [10].  The evaluation was performed using the TIRA platform, which is 
an automated tool for deployment and evaluation of the software [2].  The data 
access is restricted such that during a software run the system is encapsulated and 
thus ensuring that there is no data leakage back to the task participants [5].  This 
evaluation procedure may raises some difficulties (possible system compatibilities) 
but offers also a fair evaluation of the time needed to produce an answer.   
During the PAN CLEF 2015 evaluation campaign, four test collections were built, 
each containing at least 200 problems (training + testing).  In each collection, all the 
texts matched the same language but can be cross-topic or cross-genre and may differ 
significantly.  In this context, a problem is defined as: 
Given a small set of “known” documents (no more than seven, 
possibly as few as one) written by a single person, is the new 
“unknown” document also written by that author? 
The four benchmarks are composed of a Dutch and Spanish cross-genre collection 
and an English and Greek cross-topic corpus.  An overview of these collections is 
depicted in Table 1.  The training set will be used to evaluate our approach and the test 
set will be used in order to be able to compare our results with those of the PAN CLEF 
2015 campaign.

Greek cross-topic 100 2.9 688 100 
Spanish cross-genre 100 4.0 976 100 
Table 1.  PAN CLEF 2015 corpora statistics 
The number of problems is given under the label “No of Problems”.  The mean 
number of known documents for each problem is indicated in the column “Mean 
document”, and the mean number of words per known document under the label “Mean 
words”.  The mean number of words in the unknown documents is close to the latter. 
The last two metrics are not available for the test corpora because the datasets remained 
undisclosed thanks to the TIRA system. 
When inspecting the English training collection, the number of words available is 
rather small (in mean 341 words for each document, and exactly one document per 
problem).  Similarly the Dutch collection only provides 808 words in mean per problem 
(in mean 449 words for each document, and 1.8 documents in each problem).  This 
collection has mostly one or two document per problem but also some with 5, 6 or even 
7 known documents.  Therefore, we can expect the mean performance for these 
languages to be lower than for the other languages under the assumption that all 
languages present the same level of complexity to solve this problem.  For the Spanish 
corpus we have always four documents and rather long ones to learn the stylistic 
features of the proposed author.  A relatively higher performance can be assumed with 
this benchmark.  A similar conclusion can be expected with the Greek collection 
consisting of longer documents (in mean, 1,995 words).   
When considering the four benchmarks as a whole, we have 865 problems to solve 
and 400 to train (pre-evaluate) our system.  When inspecting the distribution of the 
correct answers, we can find the same number (432 in test and 200 in training) as 
positive or negative answers.  In each of the individual test collections, we can also find 
a balanced number of positive and negative answers.   
During the PAN CLEF 2015 campaign, a system must return a value between 0.0 
and 1.0 for each problem with a precision down to a thousandth.  A value strictly larger 
than 0.5 indicates that the query text was written by the proposed author and a value 
strictly lower than 0.5 the opposite.  Returning the value 0.5 indicates that the system 
is unable to take a decision based on the given information.  Of course, a value closer 
to 1.0 (or to 0.0) is a stronger evidence in favor of (or against) a positive answer.   
As performance measure, two evaluation measures were used during the PAN CLEF 
campaign.  The first performance measure is the AUC (Area Under the Curve) of the 
ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve [12].  This curve is generated 
according to the percentage of false positives (or false alarms) in the x-axis and the 
percentage of true positives in the y-axis over the entire test set.  The maximum value 
of 1.0 indicates a perfect performance.  Both the ROC and the AUC measures are, 
however, rather complex and difficult to interpret by a final user.   
As another measure, the PAN CLEF campaign adopts the c@1 measure [4].  This 
evaluation measure takes into account both the number of correct answers and the 
number of problems left unsolved in the test set.  The exact formulation is given in 
Equation 1 with a minimal value of 0.0 and 1.0 as an optimum value. 
𝑐@1 =
𝑛𝑐
𝑛𝑝
∙ (1 +
𝑛𝑢
𝑛𝑝
) (1) 
in which np is the number of problems, nc the number of correct answers, and nu the 
number of problems left without an answer.  This measure differentiates between an 
incorrect answer and the absence of an answer (indicating that the provided evidence 
is not enough to take a definitive decision) [10].   
3   Simple Verification Algorithm 
To solve the verification problem, we suggest an unsupervised approach based on a 
simple feature extraction and distance metric called SPATIUM-L1 (Latin word meaning 
distance).  The selected stylistic features correspond to the top k most frequent terms 
(isolated words without stemming but with the punctuation symbols).  For determining 
the value of k, previous studies have shown that a value between 200 and 300 tends to 
provide the best performance [1, 7].  Some unknown documents were rather 
short and we further excluded the words only appearing once in the text.  This 
filtering decision was taken to prevent overfitting to single occurrences. The effective 
number of terms k was set to at most 200 terms but was in most cases well below.  
With this reduced number the justification of the decision will be simpler to 
understand because it will be based on words instead of letters, bigrams of letters or 
combinations of several representation schemes or distance measures.   
In the current study, a verification problem is defined as a query text, denoted Q, and 
a set of texts (between 1 and 7) written by the same proposed author.  The concatenation 
of these texts forms the author profile A.  To measure the distance between Q and A, 
SPATIUM-L1 uses the L1-norm as follows: 
∆(𝑄, 𝐴) = ∆0= ∑ |𝑃𝑄[𝑡𝑖] − 𝑃𝐴[𝑡𝑖]|
𝑘
𝑖=1 (2) 
where k indicates the number of terms (words or punctuation symbols), and PQ[ti] and 
PA[ti] represent the estimated occurrence probability of the term ti in the query text Q 
and in the author profile A respectively.  To estimate these probabilities, we divide the 
term occurrence frequency (tfi) by the length in tokens of the corresponding text (n), 
Prob[ti] = tfi / n, without smoothing and therefore accepting a 0.0 probability.   
To verify whether the resulting ∆0 value is small or rather large, we need to select a
set of impostors.  To achieve this, three profiles from other problems in the test set were 
chosen randomly with preference to candidates that show the same number of known 
documents.  This value of three is arbitrary and will be denoted by the variable m.  After 
computing the distance between Q and each of these m profiles, we retain only the 
smallest distance.   
Instead of limiting the number of possible impostors to m, we iterate this last stage r 
times, and we suggest to fix the value r = 5.  After this last step, we have r values 
denoted ∆𝑚1, …, ∆𝑚𝑟, each of them corresponding to the minimum value of a set of m
impostors.  Instead of working with r values, we compute the arithmetic mean, denoted 
∆𝑚, of the sample ∆𝑚1, …, ∆𝑚𝑟.
Finally, the decision rule is based on the value of the ratio ∆0 / ∆𝑚 as follows:
{
𝑖𝑓 
∆0
∆𝑚
< 0.975  𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑒 𝑎𝑢𝑡ℎ𝑜𝑟
𝑖𝑓 
∆0
∆𝑚
> 1.025  𝑑𝑖𝑓𝑓𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑎𝑢𝑡ℎ𝑜𝑟
𝑜𝑡ℎ𝑒𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑠𝑒        𝑑𝑜𝑛′𝑡 𝑘𝑛𝑜𝑤
 (3) 
Thus when the ∆0 value is similar to ∆𝑚 (in the range ±2.5%), the system specifies
that the solution of this problem cannot be determined with good certainty and provides 
the answer don’t know.  On the other hand, when ∆0 is small compared to ∆𝑚, the
evidence is in favor of assuming that the author of the profile A is the real author.  
Finally, when ∆𝑚 is small compared to ∆0, we conclude that Q and A are written by
different authors.  The limit of two times 2.5% was chosen arbitrarily but corresponds 
to a well-known limit value in statistical tests.   
4   Evaluation 
Since our system is based on an unsupervised approach we were able to directly 
evaluate it using the training set.  In Table 2, we have reported the same performance 
measure applied during the PAN CLEF campaign, namely the final score, which is the 
product of the AUC and the c@1. 
Language Final AUC c@1 Runtime (h:m:s) 
Dutch 0.2161 0.4738 0.4560 00:00:08 
English 0.3450 0.6032 0.5720 00:00:07 
Greek 0.5415 0.7648 0.7080 00:00:12 
Spanish 0.5694 0.8320 0.6844 00:00:12 
Table 2.  Evaluation for the four training collections 
The algorithm returns the best results for the Spanish collection with a final score of 
0.5694 closely followed by the Greek corpus possibly due to the fact of the longer and 
numerous documents in these two languages.  The worst result is achieved with the 
Dutch collection that shows a highly diverging number of known documents per 
problem.  Usually the AUC values should be consistent and comparable with the c@1 
values but in some cases the AUC values are a lot higher than the c@1 values (mainly 
in the Spanish collection but also observable in the English and Greek corpus).  As 
possible reason we saw a few misclassifications that have very high probability scores.  
The AUC of the ROC is biased in a way that the ROC gives more emphasis on the first 
position and therefore increases the total AUC.  A misclassification with a lower 
probability is less penalized in this performance measure. 
Due to the fact that our algorithm is based on a probabilistic approach (random 
selection of candidates) the results in Table 2 may vary between runs.  To verify the 
impact of this selection in the reported performance measures, Table 3 shows the 
standard deviation and the estimated confidence interval covering 95% of the cases for 
the c@1 value based on 200 restarts with random impostor selection.   
c@1 
Language Mean Standard deviation Interval (95%) 
Dutch 0.4769 0.0210 [0.4356 – 0.5181] 
English 0.5776 0.0237 [0.5312 – 0.6241] 
Greek 0.6932 0.0258 [0.6426 – 0.7437] 
Spanish 0.6997 0.0308 [0.6393 – 0.7601] 
Table 3.  Variation around the c@1 performance for the SPATIUM-L1 system 
We can see the possible variation around the reported performance is noticeable but 
relatively small.  Similarly when changing the values of the two numbers m (number of 
impostors) and r (number of iterations) then the difference of the best possible 
combination of the two parameters to the performance reported in Table 2 is not 
significant.   
The test set is then used to rank the performance of all 18 participants in this task.  
Based on the same evaluation methodology, we achieve the results depicted in Table 4 
corresponding to the 865 problems present in the four test corpora.   
As we can see the final score with the Greek corpus is as high as expected from the 
training set.  The results we achieved in the Dutch collection is as low as in the training 
set.  On the other hand the English results are better than anticipated and the Spanish 
score is worse than the estimation from the training set.  It seems like the system 
performs better on the two cross-topic corpora (English and Greek) than on the two 
cross-genre corpora (Dutch and Spanish).

Spanish 0.3665 0.6498 0.5640 00:00:22 10 
Table 4.  Evaluation for the four testing collections 
To put those values in perspective we can see in Table 5 our result in comparison 
with the other 17 participants using macro-averaging.  We have also added a baseline 
corresponding to a system that always produces the answer yes (trivial acceptor).  The 
bad performance in the Dutch collection clearly worsens our overall results.

Table 5.  Evaluation over all four test collections using macro-averaging for the 
effectiveness measures and the sum for the runtimes.  
Another pertinent observation is the fast runtime of our system in comparison with 
other solutions1.  The median execution time of the other systems is almost one hour.  
Also the runtime only shows the actual time spent to classify the test set.  On TIRA 
there was the possibility to first train the system using the training set which had no 
influence on the final runtime.  Since we have an unsupervised system it did not need 
to train any parameters, but this possibility might have been used by other participants.  
In text categorization studies, we are convinced that a deeper analysis of the 
evaluation results is important to obtain a better understanding of the advantages and 
drawbacks of a suggested scheme.  By just focusing on overall performance measures, 
we only observe a general behavior or trend without being able to acquire a better 
1 http://www.tira.io/task/authorship-verification/ 
explanation of the proposed assignment.  To achieve this deeper understanding, we 
could analyze some problems extracted from the English corpus.  Usually, the relative 
frequency (or probability) differences with very frequent words such as when, is, in, 
that, to, or it can explain the decision. 
5   Conclusion 
This paper proposes a simple unsupervised technique to solve the authorship 
verification problem.  As features to discriminate between the proposed author and 
different impostors, we propose using the top 200 most frequent terms (words and 
punctuations).  This choice was found effective for other related tasks such 
as authorship attribution [1].  Moreover, compared to various feature selection 
strategies used in text categorization [8], the most frequent terms tend to select the 
most discriminative features when applied to stylistic studies [7].  In order to take the 
attribution decision, we propose using a simple distance metric called SPATIUM-L1 
based on the L1 norm.   
The proposed approach tends to perform very well in two different languages 
(English and Greek) on cross-topic collections and well in a Spanish cross-genre 
corpus.  Such a classifier strategy can be described as having a high bias but a 
low variance [3].  Even if the proposed system cannot capture all possible stylistic 
features (bias), changing the available data does not modify significantly the overall 
performance (variance).   
It is common to fix some parameters (such as time period, size, genre, or length of 
the data) to minimize the possible source of variation in the corpus.  However, our goal 
was to present a simple and unsupervised approach without many predefined 
arguments.  This turned out to not work well on the Dutch cross-genre corpus.  We 
suspect this to be mostly related to the genre variation than the language itself.   
SPATIUM-L1 returns a numerical value (between 0 and 1) that can be used 
to determine a degree of certainty [6].  More importantly, the proposed 
attribution could be clearly explained because it is based on a reduced set of features 
on the one hand and, on the other, those features are words or punctuation 
symbols.  Thus the interpretation for the final user is clearer than when working 
with a huge number of features, when dealing with n-grams of letters or when 
combing several similarity measures.  The SPATIUM-L1 decision can be explained by 
large differences in relative frequencies of frequent words, usually corresponding to 
functional terms.   
To improve the current classifier, we will investigate the consequence of 
some smoothing techniques, the effect of other distance measures, and different 
feature selection strategies.  In the latter case, we want to maintain a reduced number 
of terms. In a better feature selection scheme, we can take account of the underlying 
text genre, as for example, the most frequent use of personal pronouns in 
narrative texts.  As another possible improvement, we can ignore specific topical 
terms or character names appearing frequently in an author profile, terms that can be 
selected in the feature set without being useful in discriminating between authors.  
We might also try to exploit PAN specific properties such as the requirement for 
equally distributed positive and 
negative problems. In case our system decides in over half the cases for (or against) 
a verification we could assign for the least certain part that it is a don’t know answer.
