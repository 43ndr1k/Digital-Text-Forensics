Abstract 
To solve the copyright dispute, we provide a new method of authors identification for copyright 
protection in this paper .With the feature extraction and text classification, we classify the original text, 
then enter the features extracted from the disputed text in the classifier to get the author and the level 
of the disputed text. The experiment shows the proposed algorithm could classify a disputed text and 
identify the author. So we believe this method could help to solve the copyright dispute of a disputed 
text, especially the famous author’s. 
 
Keywords: Feature extraction; Data mining; Authors identification; Copyright protection 
 
1 Introduction 
 
As the rapid development of computer and network technology, more and more information 
springs up to our world carried by text, images, video and cartoon. And we can find that text is one of 
the carriers been used the most widely. It carries almost the most of the information on the internet. 
Different author has different style on writing. The different text written by the same author is the same 
on these features: writing style, sentence structure, vocabulary etc. The steps of this method we used 
are these three points follow: 
First, extract and add up the features of large amounts of text written by different authors and 
enter them into the classifier. We called it “train the classifier”. Then, by using the effectively feature 
extraction method, get the statistical vector of the disputed text and enter it in the trained classifier. 
Last, the classifier gives out the result: author’s name or classification category of the disputed text. 
Authors identification could help to solve the copyright dispute of a disputed text (especially to 
the famous author).  
The key of authors identification is setting and training classifier. Classification is a kind of 
typical supervised machine learning, also the important part of data mining[1]. The purpose of 
identification is getting the classification function or classifier by training data, and this classification 
function or classifier we got here could map the testing data to one of the classification. Text 
classification has a very range of applications on language processing, information organization and 
management, content filtering and other areas. It’s very important to choose a right classification mode. 
The commonly used classification is Support Vector Machines (SVM), K-nearest neighbor 
classification (KNN), Bayesian classification and neural network and decision tree classification[2]. 
SVM is a kind of mode identification based on statistical learning theory, mainly used in pattern 
recognition[3]. It is a linear classifier, better in minimize errors and maximize geometry edge area in 
the same time. Although there are many kinds of KNN, their basic ideas are the same: storage all or 
part of the training samples first, then classify them by comparing the difference with the storage 
trained mode. The advantage of KNN is easy to achieve fast, effective at the mode identification based 
on statistics, more accurately for unknown & abnormal distribution classification. And it’s better at 
training noise of the data, effective when the trained mode is large. Neural network imitates human’s 
brain, treats the text as a group of I/O unit, and each unit connect to another. So it could train the mode 
by adjusting the metric of every unit. 
We provide a new method of authors identification for copyright protection in this paper. The 
main idea is: extracting the feature of disputed text, creating a discriminative author’s style classifier by 
trained by KNN classifier. At last we can get the classification of the disputed text.

2 Related Work 
 
Authorship identification has been widely applied to many applications, such as verify the 
authorship of blogs [2], emails [3] and literary works [4], and forensic cases [5]. For English, the 
effective features are diverse, such as alphabetic characters count, digit characters count, uppercase and 
lowercase character count, letter frequencies, and punctuation marks count [1][3][6], which are in 
character-based level, function word (e.g., ”while”, ”upon”), and some content-specific words 
[1,7] in word-based level, Part of Speech (POS), and syntactic patterns [8] in syntactic-based level, and 
information about synonyms and hypernyms of the words based on WordNet [6] in semantic-based 
level. 
Due to the complexity of the Chinese vocabulary makes the identifying process for Chinese more 
difficult. Peng, Schuurmans, Keselj, and Wang conducted experiments on Greek, English, and Chinese 
data to examine the performance of authorship identification across different languages [1]. They noted 
that the Chinese vocabulary is much larger than the English vocabulary, which may give rise to sparse 
data problems. 
Therefore, the research on authors classification of texts through computer has become a project 
with practical significance to the data mining and artificial intelligence area. 
The aim of text automatic classification is to handle the unknown texts and to determine which 
predefined categories they belong to [9-10]. Feature extraction is the premise and base to realize the 
effective automatic classification of texts [11-13]. If the extracted feature items can’t express the 
content of the text and reflect the differences between categories properly, then automatic classification 
makes no sense. Represented by feature item through word segmentation algorithm and word 
frequency statistics directly, the dimension of the vector shall be very large [14]. So we can’t classify 
using all the words in the text. If we adopt the untreated text vectors to classify the text, it will not only 
cost much time, to reduce the efficiency of the whole process, but also affects the precision of 
classification algorithm. The results as above are not always so satisfied. So we have to purify the text 
vectors on the base of maintaining its original meaning to find the text feature which can represent its 
text feature category best.  
To solve this problem, the most effective way is to reduce dimension through feature extraction 
[15-17] [21-23]. The common way is to pick out the terms which make great contributions to text 
classification according to some selection strategy. The conventional selection strategy includes 
TF•IDF, DF, IG, MI, CHI, ECE and so on [18-22].  
This paper provides a new method of authors identification for copyright protection, using 
proposed feature extraction methods and automatic classification methods. The extracted feature can 
represent the content of the text better and has a better distinguished ability.

3 Proposed Method 
 
 
Figure 1 Proposed algorithm model  
 
The method we proposed contain two modules: training module& classification module. The main 
jobs of training module are pro-processing of the original text, feature extraction, training classifier etc. 
And the main jobs of classification module are pro-processing of the disputed text, eigenvector 
statistics, and then enter them to the trained classifier, getting author’s classes at last. The first two 
steps of these two modules are basic the same: entering the feature got from the disputed text to the 
trained classifier, getting author’s classes by similarity (if it beyond the threshold we set). Here follows 
the flow charts: 
 
3.1 Pre-processing 
 
Pre-processing contains lexical analysis, syntactic analysis, named entity recognition, anaphora 
resolution etc. Aim at original text, the first step is transforming the text to the language the computer 
can read, we called this normalize. Only the normalized text could be natural language processing. 
(1)Lexical Analysis 
After the text normalization processing, it’ll deal with the word segmentation. It’s the base of the 
next step: feature extraction. Some language such as English doesn’t need special word processing, 
because the words are setting apart by blank space. The Chinese writing unit is word, so we think that 
Chinese lexical analysis system is the base of Chinese information processing. All computer 
knowledge comes from the machine language dictionaries, syntax rules and semantics of the words and 
sentences, context, pragmatic knowledge. The result of lexical analysis will affect the effect of Chinese 
information processing. A Chinese word segmentation is good or bad based on these two sides: the 
speed and accuracy of Chinese word segmentation. In this paper, the key of Chinese word 
segmentation on accuracy is accurate segmenting the Chinese word, disambiguation, dealing with the 
strange word. The speed of Chinese word segmentation mainly contains the spending of pre-processing 
in the whole system. So we use ICTCLAS in our system. The ICTCLAS (Institute of Computing 
Technology, Chinese Lexical Analysis System) is a Chinese lexical analysis system based on Multi 
Hidden Markov Model (HMM), created by Institute of Computing Technology Chinese Academy of 
Sciences.

(2)Syntactic Analysis 
Syntactic analysis is the process which identifies grammatical structure from the sentence. 
Compare with the lexical analysis, the Chinese or English syntactic analysis has a lower accuracy. 
Because the feature of Chinese grammar and the research of it is more latter, the accuracy of Chinese 
Syntactic analysis system is lower than English. Now there are only two kinds of Chinese Syntactic 
analysis system: probabilistic parser developed by Institute of Computing Technology Chinese 
Academy of Sciences and dependency syntactic parser developed by Harbin Institute of Technology 
Information Retrieval Laboratory. 
Probabilistic parser: Probability syntax analyzer for statistical natural language processing of 
many senior applications, such as statistical machine translation, quiz systems, information extraction, 
text mining are essential, these applications directly determine the final performance. The system is a 
probability- based Chart analyzer. Systematic analysis algorithm is optimized using a variety of 
strategies. Results of the analysis are the greatest probability of a tree. The probability model, the 
system to some extent breakthrough in the context of pcfg unrelated to the assumption that the 
introduction of the context of the structural conditions, making results of the analysis accuracy rate has 
markedly improved. The use of Chinese tree of Pennsylvania library experiments, the analyzer markers 
recall rate of 75%-80%. By using phrase tree library, these two rates could as high as 90%. There 
should be not only a probability model, but also need language resource such as Treebank. For the 
development of Chinese syntactic analysis tech, they made this system public, offered all the source 
code. So the developers could go on developing and improving. 
Dependency syntactic parser: Ma J.S. et al. (information retrieval laboratory, Harbin institute of 
technology) developed a Chinese dependency parsing system by using the thought of dependency 
syntax. The system is used for syntactic analysis of Chinese, transforming the sentence consists of a 
linear sequence into a structured analysis of the dependency tree and reflecting a sentence through 
dependent arc dependencies between vocabulary.  
The system implementation process is as follows. First, the probabilities of lexical dependencies 
are obtained by training a large-scale dependency Treebank and used to build the lexical model. 
Second, the governing degree of words is introduced to utilize the structure information. The lexical 
method overcomes the weakness of POS dependencies in the past work; meanwhile the governing 
degree of words is helpful to distinguish the syntactic structures so some ill-formed structures are 
avoided. In the analysis algorithm, a deterministic search algorithm is used to sentence decoding in 
linear time. So the results of the analysis and operation efficiency and accuracy are reached higher 
level. It shows a good experimental result of around 70% accuracy. 24 dependent relationship types are 
included in this system ,as is shown in table 1. 
 
ATT（attribute） CNJ（conjunctive） 
QUN（quantity） MT（mood-tense） 
COO（coordinate） IS（independent structure） 
APP（appositive） ADV（adverbial） 
LAD（left adjunct） CMP（complement） 
RAD（right adjunct） IC（independent clause） 
VOB（verb-object） DC（dependent clause） 
POB（preposition-object） HED（head） 
SBV（subject-verb） VV（verb-verb） 
SIM（similarity）  
Table 1 Types of dependence relationship 
 
 (3)Named entity identification 
Named entity refers to the text in a meaningful entity, including names, organization name, etc. 
The research of named entity identification is an essential task in the field of natural language 
processing. It is not only an important part of the process between word segmentation and POS tagging, 
but also has a direct application in the syntactic analysis, machine translation, information retrieval,

420
information extraction and automatic Q&A system. At present, the lexical analysis system generally 
contains the function of named entity recognition. The module uses a combination of statistical and 
rule method. To achieve the best recognition results, the HMM-based method is first used for the initial 
annotation of the text, and then the effective way is used for revising the false results or missed results. 
The entire structure of the module is shown in the Figure 3.The rules of extraction is including the 
internal structure of characteristics of named entity, context feature, word feature ,etc. The module 
more comprehensive covers the Chinese names entity recognition categories, including names, place 
names, organization names, proper nous, time, date, quantity phrases and category entity. Using of 
People’s corpus test, this module general F value is 86.39% and the efficiency of 27.2 k/s. 
(4) Anaphora resolution 
Anaphora resolution is one of the core tasks in the natural language processing. It has very 
important significant on chapter analysis, automatic summarization, information extraction. Because of 
the difficulty of the anaphora resolution, the source code named anaphora resolution system on the 
internet is mainly aimed at English texts. The natural language processing system with anaphora 
resolution is mainly designing at the English texts, including the anaphora resolution modularity of 
LTP which is aimed at the Chinese texts. This module complete for anaphora resolution of the 
recognition of Chinese noun phrases based on the Peking University Fujitsu participle part-of-speech 
tagging of corpus. Tests results show that decision tree method can be applied to a very good Chinese 
noun phrase anaphora resolution problem, while there are still some problems in the anaphora 
resolution to the pronoun. Because of the small number of samples, it cannot rely on better training 
decision tree to solve the problem of pronoun anaphora resolution. So, to improve the module, seven 
rules for anaphora resolution methods are applied before using if-then rules for pronoun. The results 
show that the module for the pronoun anaphora resolution has been greatly improved. It can make clear 
up the “she “or” he” appearing in the texts to identify the pronoun of whom. 
 
3.2 Feature extraction 
 
Text referring to the characteristics of the metadata about the text is divided into descriptive 
feature and semantic feature. Descriptive characteristic is available, while semantic feature is more 
difficult to obtain. For content that is difficult to express the characteristics, we must find a way that 
can be handled by the computer. SVM, one of the better methods which set on by Salton is used more 
often in recent years. The model is expressed on a statistical model of the document, which makes 
feature items as the basic unit. Among the most famous application of the model retrieval system is the 
Smart System. In the vector space model, document content is formalized as a point in 
multidimensional space, which is gave by the vector. It is precise because the form of the document to 
define the vector to the real domain, which greatly improves the computability of natural language 
documents and operability. Document vector space model can be seen that formal methods which are 
applied to a variety of document processing formal basis and premise. The text characteristic extraction 
method is constructing an evaluation function and evaluating each characteristic and put the 
characteristics of high and low points in line. Then the number scores features is selected. Evaluation 
function which is commonly used has information gain, expected cross-entropy, mutual information, 
correlation coefficient and document frequency. The improved text method of weighing is used in the 
designed system of this paper. This new text feature weighting method based on the original TFIDF 
method increase the weight of frequent entry from the same class. Because the same class of frequent 
entry can represent the class of the text characteristic, we should give it the higher weights. According 
to our improved TFIDF of the extraction of entry more accurately represent the text content 
characteristics. 
 
3.3 Classifier 
 
According to the training-corpus text generation class templates, it set up automatic text 
categorization model for training. The inherent property of each text category and regular is found out 
and form the classification training model. The automatic text is divided into the most similar new 
category by using classification training model. Each corpus makes up feature vector for each category 
through the statistics of the word in text weight. Calculating feature selection measure is a feature

selection basis. In the feature selection process, according to the real word is usually contains noise, 
incomplete or inconsistent, it is possible that in the function of the key words in the same class as well 
as the training set difference make the result of different class template. It is necessary to delete the 
learning process irrelevant or redundant features items. And then by using the proposed new TFIDF in 
the text calculated words weight, the weights of the word all value according to the proportion scaling 
makes them into smaller specified space, and data standardized. Finally the class template is set up.

protection.

5 Conclusions and Future work 
 
The original corpus is extracted and trained by means of feature extraction methods and 
classification techniques. Features from the disputed work are extracted and put to the classifier which 
has been trained, and final it output the author or work category. This method can assist to resolve the 
dispute copyright dispute. This method can also be applied to other text classification extended. 
Sometimes the same author's writing style may be different, which make learning-based 
classification method difficult. In order to improve the accuracy of text classification, the future work 
focus on that how to extract more features that represent the feature of the original work.
