Abstract—The study of German literature is mostly based on
literary canons, i.e., small sets of specifically chosen documents.
In particular, the history of novels has been characterized using
a set of only 100 to 250 works. In this paper we address the
issue of genre classification in the context of a large set of novels
using machine learning methods in order to achieve a better
understanding of the genre of novels. To this end, we explore
how different types of features affect the performance of different
classification algorithms. We employ commonly used stylometric
features, and evaluate two types of features not yet applied to
genre classification, namely topic based features and features
based on social network graphs and character interaction. We
build features on a data set of close to 1700 novels either
written in or translated into German. Even though topics are
often considered orthogonal to genres, we find that topic based
features in combination with support vector machines achieve the
best results. Overall, we successfully apply new feature types for
genre classification in the context of novels and give directions
for further research in this area.
I. INTRODUCTION
The study of German literature is mostly based on literary
canons, i.e., small sets of specifically chosen documents [1]. In
particular, the history of novels has been characterized using a
set of only 100 to 250 works. Using small sets inherently limits
the information conveyed, for example regarding the variety
of different published works, development of genres, narrative
techniques or themes. In order to address this issue, more
works have to be included. However, the number of novels
to inspect is large and the amount of information to process is
not easy to handle. The lexicon of German poets and prosaists
from 1800 to 1913 alone lists over 9200 works [2]. Yet, as
the number of digitally available historic texts increases, this
issue can be addressed using computational approaches.
Problem setting. We focus on genre classification in order
to be able to extend existing literary canons with previously
uncategorized novels using machine learning techniques. In
particular, we focus on German novels written from the 16th
to the 20th century and their classification into the subgenres
educational and social novel. Yet, a major problem in this
context is that there are differing opinions on how to identify
genres. While most works on automatic genre classification
use stylometric features like common word frequencies [3] or
different kinds of markers (e.g. noun, POS tag, or punctuation
mark counts) [4], [5], literary research distinguishes genres
on a different level. It is mentioned, for example, that differ-
ent genres elicit different social interactions between charac-
ters [6]. Also, topics often used for text categorization [7] are
considered orthogonal to genres because documents addressing
the same topic can be of a different genre [8], [9], [4], [5]
and, in contrast to topics, a genre “describes something about
what kind of document it is rather than what the document is
about” [10]. Devitt [11] criticizes that genres are not about for-
mal features or text classification and proposes a notion based
on how humans experience the written text. This implicates
that a broad variety of features has to be considered for genre
classification. Genre concepts differ with respect to their level
of generality, for example ”literature” (superordinate), ”novel”
(basic), ”social novel” (subordinate) [12]. While most research
on automatic text classification concentrates on the basic level,
we are focussing on the subordinate level, also called subgenre.
Approach. To address the issue of genre classification on
German novels, we are going to explore different features and
classification algorithms. This is a first attempt to combine
different genre facets. Overall, we categorize these facets and
their corresponding features into three categories: features
based on stylometrics ([3], [4], [5]), features based on content,
and features based on social networks ([13], [6]), aiming to
cover “human experience” [11] as completely as possible.
For textual statistics, we use word frequencies as similarly
proposed in [3]. For content based features, we are applying
Latent Dirichlet Analysis [14] and automatically extract topic
distributions. In order to cover features dealing with social
networks, we extract character and interaction graphs from the
novels and use them to build corresponding features. We com-
pare these features using different classification algorithms,
including rule based approaches, support vector machines and
decision trees. Feature extraction is based on a set of 1682
novels written in or translated into German from the early
16th to the 20th century. Training and testing is executed on
a subset of 132 labeled samples.
Contribution and Findings. To the best of the authors’
knowledge, we are the first to quantitatively compare different
feature types and classification algorithms on German novels.
Also, as far as the sighted literature suggests, content specific
features based on statistical topics as well as features based on
social networks have not been applied to genre classification
in general. Even though our testing data set is limited, our ex-
periments indicate that topic-based features are a good feature
for sub-genre classification. This is an interesting result, since
literature research as well as other works in the field of genre
classification emphasize that topics and genres are orthogonal
concepts. Our results implicate that this orthogonality does not
necessarily diminish the value of topics for genre classification.
In contrast and against points raised by literature research
([13], [6]), classification on features based on social networks
perform worse than the baseline. Yet this might be due to error
prone named entity recognition or a mismatch of the extracted
features. Overall, we successfully apply new feature types for
genre classification in the context of novels and are able to
give directions for further research in this area.
Structure. The rest of the paper is structured as follows: In
Section II we describe works related to this paper. In Section
III we introduce the features we are using for classification
and in Section IV we give a short overview of our data set,
the classification algorithms we apply and the corresponding
results. We finish the paper with a discussion of our results in
Section V and a short conclusion in Section VI.
II. RELATED WORK
Genre classification is broadly applied in different areas,
i.e., music [15], movies [16] and text based documents. For text
based documents, there are several subcategories. Prominent
examples are web pages [8], news paper articles ([3], [7]) or
English prose [5]. There is also work crossing these subcate-
gories as by Lee et. al [17] who take into account English and
Korean research papers, homepages, reviews and more. In our
paper we focus on a subset of genre classification in literature,
namely classifying genres of novels, all of them either written
in or translated into German language. Specifically, we inves-
tigate social and educational novels as sub-genres of novels.
Biber [9] introduces five dimensions of English texts and
applies them to text categorization. He defines this approach
using textual statistics like the frequency of nouns, present
tense verbs, or word lengths and argues that such dimensions
are context and domain specific. He does not apply them to
automatic genre categorization. However, Karlgren and Cutting
use some of Bibers features for recognizing text genres using
discriminant analysis [4] on the Brown corpus [18] which rep-
resents a sample of English prose. They achieve an error rate of
about 4% on the classes “Informative” and “Imaginative” and
error rates up to 48% on more fine-grained genres. Building on
research from Kessler et al. [5] and Burrows [19], Stamatatos
et al. [3] use most frequent words for genre classification.
They emphasize that frequencies are easy to compute and
do not rely on the performance limits of external tools. They
achieved error rates as low as 2.5% on newspaper articles using
discriminative analysis. [8] use similar text statistics to classify
genres of web pages, achieving an accuracy of 70%.
Jockers [20] reports on using successfully 42 high fre-
quency tokens for the clustering of novel genres but cannot
separate the authorial signal from the genre and time period
signals. Underwood et al. [21] correctly point out two problems
for the classification of novel genres: Historical heterogeneity
because of the development of novel genres over time and fea-
ture heterogeneity because of the length of novels in contrast
to articles, web pages etc. often used in genre classifications.
Rosen-Zvi et al. [22] recognize the close relationship of words,
topics and authors. They build a joint author-topic model based
on Latent Dirichlet Analysis (LDA) [14]. This method directly
or indirectly uses the notion of “topics” for author attribution.
In this paper, we pick up this idea and use topics inferred using
LDA as features for genre classification on German novels.
Another dimension that characterizes genre are social net-
works and interaction graphs between characters [6]. Extract-
ing social networks or interactions from literary work has
been addressed before [23] but was not applied to genre
classification. Thus, in this paper, we build social network and
interaction graphs and use different graph metrics as building
blocks for new features.

III. FEATURES
In this section, we describe the features we investigate
for genre classification and how we derive them from the
data set. As mentioned before we look at three types of
features: stylometric, content-based and social features. The
stylometric as well as content-based features are extracted and
normalized based on the whole corpus consisting of 1682
novels. Social features on the other hand are extracted from
each novel separately. Thus, no inter-novel dependencies are
present. Overall we obtain 216 features, all normalized to a
range of [0,1], i.e., 101 stylometric, 70 content-based and 45
social feature as described in the following.
A. Stylometric features
In literary studies stylometry denotes the statistical analysis
of texts to distinguish between authors or genres, e.g. by
looking at word distributions. As mentioned by Stamatatos et
al. [3] there is a wide range of stylometric features, including
punctuation frequencies. Along the same lines, we also focus
on word and punctuation frequencies to represent stylometric
features. Note, that Stamatatos et al. use word frequencies
over the whole English language and report this approach
to perform better than just using word frequencies calculated
from their corpus consisting of relatively short news paper
articles. However, in contrast the average word count in our
corpus is about 100,000 words over almost 1700 novels. This
results in enough data to assume that we have a rather repre-
sentative sample of the German language. We determine the
most common words and punctuation marks and use the overall
first hundred of them for classification. The ten most common
tokens are depicted in Table I. To reduce bias stemming from
differing text lengths, the features are normalized by dividing
by the sum of the top hundred frequencies. As a small addition
we also add the length of the text as a feature resulting in
overall 101 features for this feature type.
B. Content-based features
In contrast to stylometric features which focus on features
of writing style, content-based features capture the content
of the corresponding novels. One particular way to represent
content in the form of word distributions are topics as for
example used in newspaper categorization [7]. For example,
the top words associated with topics “emotions” and “formal
society” are shown in Table III. In our work, we first remove
predefined stop words from the novels and then use Latent
Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) [14] on all 1682 works to extract
topics in the form of word distributions. As LDA is an
unsupervised topic model we can use it to automatically build
topics, some if which might correspond to core vocabularies
of genres. This is in contrast to core vocabularies which need
genre information and manual selection at some point. These
topics are then used to derive a topic distribution for each
novel, i.e., we calculate how strongly each topic is associated
with each novel. We interpret each topic association to a novel
as a feature. In particular, we use LDA to extract 70 topics and
set both required parameters α and β to 0.01 where each novel
represents one document used as input for LDA, resulting in
70 content-based features. In this first study on combining
different feature spaces, we did not optimize parameters.
C. Social features
Literary studies suggest that the genres we look at, namely
social and educational novels, can be characterized by the
number of protagonists and their interactions [13]. Thus, we
aim to capture such characteristics using features derived from
character and interaction graphs.
Character graph: Each character forms a node. Whenever
two characters appear in one sentence we draw an edge.
Interaction graph: All characters in one sentence form a
node representing an interaction. When the next interaction
is described we draw an edge between successive interactions.
In order to create these graphs, we need to identify characters
for each novel. We extract them by using the named entity
recognition tool1 by Jannidis et al. [24] which adapts well
to the domain of German novels. Social features are then
based on the most important characters and interactions in each
novel, identified by using standard centrality measures, namely
degree, closeness, betweenness and eigenvector centrality as
for example defined by Noori [25]. High centrality values are
supposed to correspond to important characters.
Based on these characters and interactions we attempt to
model two important aspects: On one hand, there are novels
which focus on one protagonist and one important interaction.
On the other hand, there are novels which show a broader
variety of characters and interactions, all equally important
for the plot. Of course there are also novels which are a
mixture of both aspects. We try to model these aspects by
comparing the different centralities and derive features on i)
how the centralities for the single most important character
and the single most important interaction agree across different
centrality measures, ii) how centrality measures differ across
the most important four characters and interactions and finally,
iii) we try to characterize the importance across the ten most
important characters and interactions by modelling and com-
paring corresponding centrality distributions. In the following,
we describe the resulting 45 social features in detail.
i) For centrality agreement on the most important characters
and interactions, we take the nodes with the highest centrality
values for each of the four centrality measure from both, the
character and interaction graph, and calculate the average of
the corresponding eight centrality values (ac). We calculate
the same average for each type of graph separately summing
up four centrality values each, i.e., one for each centrality
measure, resulting in an average for the character graph (acf)
and the interaction graph (aci). Additionally, we construct two
features measuring whether the average for the character graph
(acf) and the interaction graph (aci) agree (sd) or disagree (dd).
Novels with one protagonist and one important interaction
should have high scores for (ac), (acf), (aci) and (sd). Overall
this results in 5 features.
ii) For centrality difference on the most important nodes, our
motivation is that most information regarding centrality distri-

butions lies within the first few centralities, cf. Table II. There-
fore, we build another group of features for each centrality
measure: We calculate the subsequent difference in centrality
values of the four most important nodes in descending order for
both graphs separately regarding a single measure. This yields
three positive valued differences for each graph resulting in 24
features over all four centrality measures.
iii) Finally, in order to characterize importance across the ten
most important characters and interactions, we apply curve
fitting to the ten highest centrality values for each centrality
measure and each graph which are roughly power law dis-
tributed (see Table II). We fit a power law curve f(x) = a ·xb
and extract the two parameters a and b of the fitted curve.
Thus, we have two parameters for each curve, two graphs and
four centrality measures, resulting in a total of 16 features.
IV. EVALUATION
In the following, we describe the data sets used in our
experiments, the different classifiers and the results for the
different feature sets.
Data sets. In this paper, we use a corpus consisting of 1682
German novels freely available at TextGrid2, DTA3 and Guten-
berg4. The list of titles used in this work will be published
online5. Domain experts identified 11 of them as prototypical
social and 21 as prototypical educational novels. This forms
our first labeled subset, called prototype, and represents 32
novels which have very accurate labels. Another disjoint set
of 100 novels was labeled by domain experts with the same
classes yet not necessarily representing prototypical examples
of either category. Of these 100 novels, 66 belong to class
social and 34 to class educational. The overall 132 labeled
novels form the second data set, called labeled.
All novels were written in or translated into German and
date of origin ranges from the 16th to the 20th century.
Most authors are male including for example Charles Dickens,
Theodor Fontane, Karl May, Sir Walter Scott or Émile Zola.
Text lengths range from 4000 to over one million words, the
average word count being 100000. In contrast articles in the
New York Times typically run from 400 to 1200 words6. To
the best of our knowledge this is the first corpus containing
genre-labeled German novels.
Classifiers. There exists a wide array of different classification
algorithms. We will evaluate k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN),

4https://www.gutenberg.org/
5http://dmir.org/genre-data

Naive Bayes (NB), Fuzzy Rule Learning (Rule), C4.5 pruned
and unpruned (Tree), Multilayer Neural Network (NN) and
linear Support Vector Machine (SVM), each implemented in
KNIME7 with standard parameters. As baseline we use a
majority vote classifier (MV) which yields an accuracy score
of 0.66 for data set prototype and 0.58 for labeled.
Feature sets. We use different subsets of the features intro-
duced in Section III for classification, namely stylometric (st),
topics (t), social (so), stylometric and topics (st+t), stylometric
and social (st+so), topics and social (t+so) and all. We deter-
mine classification accuracy for each subset and each classifier.
To account for the small data sets, we use 100 iterations of
10-fold cross validation. The depicted result are the average
over these 1000 accuracy values.
Results. Tables IV and V show accuracy results for the
prototype and labeled data set respectively. Those classifier-
feature combinations which did significantly better than the
majority vote baseline (MV) are marked bold in the tables.
Statistical significance was tested using a t-test at α = 0.01.
Additionally, the best result for each classifier is underlined.
Generally, several classifier-feature tuples yield signifi-
cantly (below: sign.) better results than the baseline. This
indicates that we actually defined features which tend to
capture the difference between the two genres, social and
educational. Overall, results are better on the prototype data.
Since the corresponding novels are prototypical for each genre,
this strengthens the assumption that our features capture the
actual genre characteristics. At the same time, while the accu-
racy values are slightly smaller, more classifier-feature tuples
deliver sign. better accuracy for the larger labeled data set.
The drop in accuracy is expected since genre characteristics
are weaker in this data set. Yet, the larger number of sign.
better accuracy values indicates that our features also work on
larger data sets with varying strengths in genre characteristics.
Regarding different classifiers, basic classifiers like kNN,
NB and Rule perform better on the small prototype data and
worse on the labeled data when comparing against the SVM
which might be due to the different class distributions. Fuzzy
Rule Learning performs sign. worse than the baseline for every
feature set on the labeled data whereas Naive Bayes yields
better results over all feature sets and performs comparably
well especially on the prototype data. For the small but
securely labeled sample protopye pruning generally helps sign.
to enhance decision trees, probably due to avoiding overfitting.
Overall, SVM yields sign. the best results on every feature set
apart from social features for labeled data, indicating that it
may be the best choice for further applications.
Even though literature suggests the orthogonality of genres
and topics [8] and mentions social features to be characteristic
for certain genres [13], overall topic features score sign. best
and social features worst among all feature sets. Adding social
or stylometric features to the topic set results in a sign. better
performance in only two cases. Hence, topic features alone
are the best discriminative factors for educational and social
novels. This indicates that despite orthogonality of topic and
genre, topics may still be useful for genre classifiction. The
bad performance of social features on the other hand may lie
in the error prone named entity recognition or in the particular
feature generation process we use. Overall, the best accuracy is

achieved when using a Support Vector Machine in conjunction
with topic features: 0.83 and 0.81 respectively.
As topic features yield the best results, we take a closer
look at the specific topics that are used in the classification
process. Among the tested classifiers decision trees are best
suited for interpretable results and the scores of pruned trees
are above the baseline. In the following, we take a look at
the first decision of the pruned trees using only topic features.
For the prototype data, the pruned decision trees test the topic
characterized by titles (Mrs., Mr., madame) as well as persons
(woman and man) which can be denoted by the same words
in German (Frau, Herr) first, see Topic 1 in Table III. If this
topic is present, novels are more likely to be labeled as social
by the decision tree. This is in line with the fact that social
novels talk a lot about persons in a formal or descriptive way.
For the labeled data another topic is used as the first decision
indicator: It includes references to emotions (love, heart, soul)
as well as to family members (mother, father), see Topic 2 in
Table III. If this topic is present, novels are more likely to be
labeled with the genre educational by the decision tree. This is
in line with the fact that educational novels focus on feelings,
family and experiencing life.
V. DISCUSSION
In this work, we have introduced two new feature types
for genre classification in the context of novels and conducted
experiments showing that topic based features perform well.
In this section we discuss potential limitations of the approach
and outline future work to be addressed in this context.
Limited data set and choice of genres. Our data set consists
of almost 1700 novels with only a small subset being labeled as
educational or social. We had 132 labeled instances containing
32 labeled as genre protoypes. While we believe that this is a
good starting point for initial evaluation of feature performance
and usefulness, which was the goal of this article, we also
acknowledge that a more extensive study on different data
sets and more genres classes needs to be conducted in order
to further deepen the understanding of how the proposed
features interact with genres in a more general way. Feature
performance may vary given different environments.
Joint topic models. Since topic based features have been per-
forming best, we believe that further research in this direction
is justified. Building joint genre-topic models in the same way
as author-topic models [22] is a promising line of future work.
[22] also suggest to incorporate stylometric features to further
improve their model which matches the common application
of such features for genre classification [3].
Advanced NER and social evolution. In our current study we
use conservative rules for NER i.e., we avoid currently error
prone features like cross referencing. This may be one reason
for the observed performance levels below baseline. Also,
there exist more advanced methods to build social networks as
described in [23]. After generating the graphs there is another
large array of measures and methods to derive features which
are then utilized for classification. One reason to further go into
this direction is that different types of interactions are arguably
part of the characteristics of different genres [13]. In particular,
character development projects directly into the evolution of
social and interaction networks throughout the novel, which
we would therefore like to inspect further.
VI. CONCLUSION
In this paper, we have addressed the issue of genre classifi-
cation in the context of novels. To this end, we applied different
classification algorithms and evaluated a diverse set of features.
Besides stylometric features common to genre classification
we introduced two types of features which, to the best of
our knowledge, have not been applied to genre classification
before. That is, topic based features derived from statistical
topics automatically generated using Latent Dirichlet Analysis
and features based on social networks extracted from the
novels. We evaluated how these features affected classification
performance and found that the new features based on topics in
combination with Support Vector Machine classification works
best. This is especially interesting since genres and topics are
considered to be orthogonal concepts. Overall, we successfully
apply new feature types for genre classification in the context
of novels and give directions for further research in this area.
In future work, our study can be extended by using larger
data sets and different sets of genre types. Additionally, since
topic based features work well, further research in this area is
promising. In particular, joint genre-topic models in line with
author-topic models are an interesting direction. Furthermore,
even if social network and interaction based features have not
been yielding the best results, advanced NER tools as well
as considering current work in extracting static and dynamic
networks may improve the performance of this type of features.
