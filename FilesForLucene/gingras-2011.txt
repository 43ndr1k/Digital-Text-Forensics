This study aims to identify the markers of artistic individuality in music 
performance by discriminating between piece-specific stylistic influences 
and commonalities in performers’ expressive patterns across pieces, us-
ing a robust statistical approach. Twelve professional harpsichordists 
from the Montreal area recorded three pieces on a harpsichord equipped 
with a MIDI console. Each piece was recorded at least twice. Perform-
ances were matched to the scores of the pieces using an algorithm devel-
oped by the authors. Four expressive parameters were analyzed: velocity, 
note onset asynchrony, timing deviations, and articulation. Analyses of 
variance using linear mixed models were used to estimate effects related 
to individual performers and specific pieces. Mantel correlograms, which 
allow comparisons between two similarity matrices, were used to com-
pare expressive strategies on a note-by-note basis across pieces. Com-
parisons across pieces revealed significant differences in the amount of 
overlap and velocity employed for specific pieces. Some performers con-
sistently deviated from the mean values for specific expressive parame-
ters, indicating that some broad markers of artistic individuality may 
transcend pieces and genres. Correlational analyses revealed unexpected 
dissimilarities between pieces in the performers’ note-by-note expressive 
profiles. Musicological considerations and stylistic issues are advanced to 
explain these observations.

Over the last few decades, a growing body of research has examined issues 
related to individuality in musical performance (Repp 1992, Sloboda 2000).

Computational methods have led to the development of higher-level descrip-
tors to capture and identify recurrent expressive gestures associated with a 
given performer (Widmer and Goebl 2004). However, few studies have at-
tempted to quantify markers of individuality that transcend specific pieces 
and musical styles. Indeed, among the factors which influence a performer’s 
interpretative choices, some derive from performer-specific tendencies and 
others from stylistic considerations related to the piece being performed. In 
order to identify which performance characteristics are reliable markers of a 
performer’s artistic individuality across genres and styles, it is necessary, as a 
first step, to disentangle these two contributions. Nevertheless, it has proven 
difficult, for several reasons, to untangle these factors. One obvious issue is 
that pieces vary in length, texture, and meter. Another is that different ex-
pressive parameters, such as articulation, velocity, or tempo, are measured in 
different units and cannot be directly compared. Thus, there is a need for a 
robust methodological approach that allows us to obtain valid statistical in-
ferences even when comparing across pieces and expressive parameters.  
Stamatatos and Widmer (2005) showed, by developing a computer algo-
rithm which can recognize individual performers playing two different pieces 
by Chopin, that performer-specific characteristics could be reliably identified 
across pieces. This study focused on methodological issues related to ma-
chine-learning algorithms rather than on musicological aspects. The present 
article aims to expand on this previous work by presenting a quantitative 
approach for discriminating between piece-specific stylistic influences and 
commonalities in performers’ expressive patterns across pieces. A related 
goal is the development of a reliable method for evaluating and comparing 
expressive strategies across pieces. 
 
METHOD 
Participants 
Twelve professional harpsichordists, five female and seven male, from the 
Montreal area were invited to participate in the experiment. Their average 
age was 39 years (range=21-61). They had played the harpsichord for a mean 
duration of 22 years (range=6-40). Seven of them had previously won prizes 
in regional, national, or international harpsichord competitions. 
 
Materials 
The following three pieces were selected for this experiment: the third varia-
tion from the Partita No. 12 sopra l’aria di Ruggiero by Girolamo 
INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON PERFORMANCE SCIENCE 467 
Frescobaldi (1583-1643), the Prélude non mesuré No.7, an unmeasured 
prelude by Louis Couperin (1626-1661), and Les Bergeries, a rondo by 
François Couperin (1668-1733).  
 
Procedure 
Performances took place in an acoustically treated studio, on an Italian-style 
Bigaud harpsichord (Paris, Heugel) with two 8-foot stops. Only the back stop 
was used for the experiment. This harpsichord was equipped with a MIDI 
console, allowing precise measurement of performance parameters. MIDI 
velocity values for each note event were coded in a range between 16 (slowest) 
and 100 (fastest). The audio signal was recorded through two omnidirectional 
microphones MKH 8020. The microphones were located 1 m above the reso-
nance board and were placed 25 cm apart. The audio and MIDI signals were 
sent to a PC computer through a RME Fireface audio interface. Audio and 
MIDI data were then recorded using Cakewalk’s SONAR software and stored 
on a hard disk. Each piece was recorded at least twice. Performances were 
matched to the scores of the pieces using an algorithm developed by the au-
thors (Gingras and McAdams 2011). Four expressive parameters were ana-
lyzed: velocity, note onset asynchrony, timing deviations, and articulation. 
 
RESULTS 
Two statistical approaches were used to quantify performance features. The 
first approach involved the examination of global trends at the levels of pieces 
or performers, grouping all notes together instead of focusing on note-by-
note comparisons, using analyses of variance (ANOVAs). This statistical 
method was used to determine whether, for instance, there were significant 
differences in the mean velocity between performers and to isolate the contri-
bution of specific pieces from the unique characteristics of performers. One 
drawback of this method is that it is not suitable for analyzing differences in 
expressive profiles that are only manifest on a note-by-note level. Thus, a 
second approach was necessary to compare the note-by-note correlations 
between different performances and to use these correlations as a measure of 
similarity between performers’ profiles. This procedure was used, for in-
stance, to evaluate whether the articulation profiles of different performers 
were more similar between certain pieces than between others. 
Table 1 summarizes the results of a series of repeated-measures mixed-
models ANOVAs conducted on each expressive parameter, with individual 
performers (n=12) treated as a random effect and pieces (n=3) treated as a 
fixed effect, with two recordings per piece. Post-hoc comparisons between

pieces were computed using Tukey’s HSD correction. Comparisons across 
pieces revealed that the Prélude tended to be played with a significantly more 
legato articulation and with less velocity than the Partita or the Bergeries. 
Comparison across performers showed that a few performers either played 
with a consistently more detached (performers 7 and 10) or more legato 
(performers 3 and 5) articulation. Similar individual variations were observed 
for the magnitude of the chord onset asynchronies and for the attack velocity. 
Correlations were also computed on a note-by-note basis between all 
pairs of performances for each expressive performance. Standardized values 
(Z-scores) were used to obtain dimensionless units, allowing for comparisons 
across expressive parameters and across pieces. These correlations were then 
used to obtain similarity matrices for each expressive parameter. Mantel 
tests, a non-parametric permutation test which evaluates the degree of cor-
relation between two similarity matrices (Mantel 1967), were used to deter-
mine the distance between two matrices. Ten thousand permutations were 
conducted. Intriguingly, the Mantel correlograms (see Table 2) suggest that, 
for all expressive parameters analyzed here, there was a greater similarity in 
the expressive strategies employed between the Partita and the Prélude non 
mesuré than between the Partita and the Bergeries. In fact, R values between 
the Bergeries and the Partita were significantly negative, suggesting that 
performers who used a similar strategy for one piece tended to use contrast-
ing strategies for the other, indicating a lack of agreement between perform-
ers. In contrast, performers who employed similar strategies for the Partita

were more likely to use similar strategies for the Prélude. The fact that the
agreement between performers was higher between the Partita and the Pré-
lude than between the Partita and the Bergeries was somewhat unexpected 
given that the Prélude is markedly different from the other two pieces due to 
its unmeasured character. 
 
DISCUSSION 
In this article, we presented two statistical approaches used for discriminat-
ing between performer-specific interpretive features and piece-specific influ-
ences. ANOVAs showed significant differences in the amount of overlap and 
velocity between specific pieces. Our results also indicate that some individ-
ual performers consistently deviated (across all three pieces) from the mean 
values for specific expressive parameters, suggesting that some broad mark-
ers of artistic individuality, such as the amount of overlap or the magnitude of 
chord onset asynchronies, may transcend pieces and genres.  
Correlational analyses revealed that similarities between the expressive 
strategies applied by performers on a note-by-note level were greater between 
the Partita and the Prélude than between the Bergeries and the Partita, an 
unexpected result given that the Prélude is an unmeasured piece written in a 
markedly different style from the other two pieces. Although the Bergeries 
and the Partita seem much closer to each other than to the Prélude from a 
musicological perspective, it is possible that other stylistic features, related 
for instance to the date of composition, the meter (the Bergeries is written in 
6/8) or the texture (homophony versus polyphony) played a role in perform-
470 WWW.PERFORMANCESCIENCE.ORG 
ers’ choice of expressive strategies. Further musicological analysis is neces-
sary in order to better understand this result. 
Besides proposing a novel methodological framework for quantifying 
performer- and piece-related influences on interpretative choices, this study 
provides a complementary approach to empirical research examining the 
perception of artistic individuality in music performance (Koren and Gingras 
2011). Future research should include the analysis of other expressive strate-
gies, such as durational contrasts (for instance, eighth versus quarter notes) 
or metrical emphasis (strong versus weak beats).
