The Authorship of the Disputed
Federalist Papers with an Annotated
Corpus
Antonio Miranda-Garcı́a and Javier Calle-Martı́n
The present paper discusses the potentials of annotated corpora in authorship attribution
studies. These corpora allow the retrieval of morpho-syntactic information, which may
serve as stylistic features, getting beyond the most common word-based approaches. In
itself, annotation is meant to contain the structural mark-up, the lemmatization, the
part-of-speech mark-up, and the textual reference. For the purpose, the corpus of the
Federalist Papers is tested to explore Burrows’s Delta from a twofold perspective, lemma-
based Delta and POS-based Delta. The experiments come to demonstrate the validity of
these approaches for authorial attribution with the finding of empirical evidence to
assign, in the majority of cases, the hand responsible for the disputed Federalist Papers,
but for paper 55, traditionally considered less Madisonian in the relevant literature.
1. Introduction
The attribution of the disputed Federalist Papers has traditionally been a common
ground for scholars, historians and statisticians in particular, endeavouring to find a
substantial piece of evidence which allows the attribution of the disputed papers
either to Alexander Hamilton or to James Madison. The publication of Frederick
Mosteller and David L. Wallace’s work in 1964 is nowadays considered the most
respected insight into The Federalist Papers in favour of the Madisonian composition
of the disputed samples through the application of Bayes’s theory of inference.1 As a
landmark in the field, this work has thenceforth initiated a plethora of studies, both
from a traditional and a non-traditional perspective, to such extent that ‘‘hundreds of
papers have cited the Mosteller and Wallace work and over two dozen non-
traditional attribution practitioners have analyzed and/or conducted variations of the
original study’’.2

The number and variety of approaches to the topic are then justified from a
twofold perspective: the testing of new statistical approaches against Mosteller and
Wallace touchstone study3 and the subsequent validation of the models as reliable
techniques in attributing the authorship of other witnesses. A cursory look at the
relevant publications in the field reveals the use of the following techniques to
discriminate the disputed Federalist Papers, that is artificial neural networks,4 content
analysis,5 genetic algorithms,6 principal component analysis,7 linear discriminant
analysis,8 support vector machines,9 Delta,10 and bigrams and trigrams,11 among
others.
Besides these meritorious attempts, most of which are based on word-level
statistics with raw texts, the employment of an annotated corpus of The Federalist
Papers would constitute a supplementary input to corroborate or refute the
working hypothesis about the likely hand of the disputed Papers by using other
stylometric techniques. However, the use of annotated corpora for authorial
purposes is not deprived of controversy among practitioners. On the positive side,
it is now more than a decade since David I. Holmes suggested that tagged corpora
would make the analysis of an author’s syntax viable, hence providing a better
classificatory accuracy. Even though acknowledging that syntactically based
stylometric techniques were exciting prospects for authorship attribution, he also
regretted that the task was not often easy in view of the time investment required.12
Contrariwise, Joseph Rudman would then represent the other side of the coin when
he disapproved lemmatizing as a source of experimental corruption of the source
data.13
The present paper is based on the corpus of The Federalist Papers provided with
a) structural mark-up (including the author—if known, paper number, date and
publication venue, among others); b) lemmatizing (following the conventional
entries of a general-purpose dictionary); c) part-of-speech (POS) mark-up; and d)
textual reference for citing purposes. The lemmatizing and POS-tagging of the
words go beyond word-based approaches as the context is necessarily concerned.14
On the one hand, lemmatizing stands for an umbrella sheltering not only spelling
variation in itself (i.e. impotence vs. impotency, transcendant vs. transcendent) but also
morphological variation (i.e. be, is, are, was, were, being, etc.; paper/papers; good/

better/best) together with pluri-lexematic units such as proper names (Great Britain,
Magna Charta, Pope Julius II), borrowings (habeas corpus, ignis fatuus, lex loci) or
adjective/prepositional/conjunctive phrases (i.e. long-lived, instead of, not only . . . but
also, etc.). The POS-tagging, on the other hand, pursues the assignment of the
corresponding word-class together with the disambiguation of homonyms yielding
more accurate results from the input corpus.
Disambiguated homonyms allow a more homogenous contrastive analysis to
explore authorial variation, both with absolute and relative figures. As demonstrated
in a previous paper, these homonyms are semantically distinct and many a time
become reliable discriminators of an author’s style.15 The latter, for instance,
lend themselves well to study the occurrence of a particular lemma in terms of its
universe or even to assess the use and distribution of the different variants within a
same lemma. This ratio is beyond the author’s manipulation as shown by the
homonymic disambiguation of to for distinguishing between Madison and Hamilton:
to functioning as an infinitive marker amounts to 16.41 and 17.41 occurrences
every 1,000 words in Madison and the disputed papers, which sharply contrasts
Hamilton and Jay (24.43 and 20.91 occurrences, respectively).16 Even though these
data come to corroborate an evident likeness between Madison and the disputed
papers as a whole (in contrast with Hamilton and Jay), one cannot reach the same
conclusions as to the likely authorship of each of the twelve disputed papers
independently.
On the grounds of this, the main objective of the present paper is to demonstrate
the potentials of the stylometric features obtained from annotated corpora in
authorship attribution studies, the corpus of The Federalist Papers being accordingly
used as a study case. The lemmas and POS of this input will serve to test John F.
Burrows’s original Delta and David L. Hoover’s adaptations.17 These experiments will
allow us, in some cases, to validate the Madisonian authorship18 of the disputed
papers by means of lemma- and POS-based searching as has already been
accomplished at word-level from a raw corpus.19
The paper is divided into three sections. Section 2 accounts for the building of the
annotated corpus. In section 3, the corpus of The Federalist Papers is processed and the
results are respectively analysed from the perspective of 1) lemma-based Delta and 2)
POS-based Delta.20 The former has been divided into five subsections according to the
procedure followed. Finally, the conclusions are dealt with in section 4.

16Similarly, a sound discriminatory basis arises with the analysis of other items like the relativizer that, the verbs
to be and to have as auxiliary verbs.

18In this issue, however, Joseph Rudman acknowledges that ‘‘it looks more and more like the twelve disputed
Federalist papers are actually Hamilton and Madison collaborations of one sort or another—this is confirmed by
traditional and non-traditional methods.’’

2. Corpus Compilation and Annotation
The corpus of The Federalist Papers has been downloaded from the Project Gutenberg
website,21 and subsequently saved as .txt files in different folders thus complying with
the structural mark-up and textual reference requirements. Each folder constitutes a
sub-corpus containing the undisputed and the disputed samples, that is Hamilton,
Madison, Jay, on the one hand, and the disputed papers, on the other. The texts of
each file are then lemmatized and POS-tagged with Genia Tagger 3.022 and for further
processing the output is fed into a MySQL database. The lemmas provided by Genia
Tagger consistently coincide with the conventional entry of a general-purpose
dictionary. However, homonymous lemmas are syntactically disambiguated with the
use of the following notation after the lemma: a (adjective), b (adverb), c
(conjunction), d (determiner), e (existential), h (interjection), im (infinitive marker),
n (noun), p (preposition), r (pronoun), v (verb), va (auxiliary verb), vto (be to and
have to) and vm (modal verb). In addition, compounds and other associations are
treated as a single lemma if the combination becomes lexicalized or grammaticalized,
as in a) noun compounds like common-law; b) function words in a periphrasis like
instead of, because of, notwithstanding that, out of, as to; c) foreign borrowings like lex
loci, in lieu of; and d) other associations.
Although Rudman complains about the expediency of many non-traditional
attribution studies because the control data are not given in detail to other
prospective researchers and proposes to afford a well-defined experimental set-up in
the assumption that ‘‘all the constituent parts are needed for a valid study’’,23 the
present study will not describe the POS tag-set used for the sake of space (Penn
Treebank Tag-set),24 but it must be noted that some tags assigned by Genia are
decomposed into class and accidence when it is the case (NNS becomes Noun Plur,
and VBZ becomes Verb Sing Present) to allow Boolean searches.
After the actual compilation itself, the annotated corpus of The Federalist Papers is
processed with TexSEn, an ad hoc software tool which has been especially designed to
comply with a corpus of these characteristics, lemma-based and POS-based
information being accordingly retrieved.25
3. Analysis
Non-traditional attribution studies are often at odds as to the appropriate data for
scrutiny, whether a raw or an elaborated text. In itself, any kind of manipulation by
21http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/18, being the only resource available at the outset of this research. There are
now other resources like the following: http://www.foundingfathers.info/federalistpapers/fedindex.htm; http://

the compiler may be understood as an unnecessary corruption of the raw data
plausibly influencing the reliability of the results.26 Hoover considers that elaborated
texts are not necessary by highlighting the potentials of the raw text for the
application of Delta.27 However, it is a fact that elaborated texts have been used by
practitioners who postulate an increased reliability of the results, especially when
highly inflected languages are concerned.28
In line with the second trend, the present paper discusses the use of
lemmatization, POS-tagging and the testing of Burrows’s Delta for authorship
attribution studies.29 The procedure consists of three stages. First, TexSEn processes
the corpus and outputs a frequency lemma-list, both as a whole and across the
different hands (Hamilton, Madison and Jay). The sample in Table 1 reproduces the
fifty most common disambiguated lemmas incorporating their percentage together
with the mean (m) and the standard deviation (s).
Second, a similar frequency lemma-list is generated for each of the twelve disputed
papers containing the ranking of every item in its universe, its absolute and relative
occurrence, as well as the values for m and s.
Third, Delta is calculated for each disputed writing, summarized by Burrows
himself as ‘‘add them up and average them out’’,30 and formally defined as ‘‘the mean
of the absolute differences between the z-scores for a set of word-variables in an
authorial text-group and the z-scores for the same set of word-variables in a target
set’’.31 Burrows’s process can be explained stepwise as follows: a) score each word in
its own sub-corpus or paper; b) z-score each word (difference of the rate of each
word to the mean of the main corpus, m, divided by the standard deviation, s);
c) find the difference of the z-score for each word in the texts being compared
as each one is, in succession, measured against the one constituting the main corpus;
d) add the absolute values of the differences and average them; and e) compare the
results.
The described procedure will be referred to as standard Delta whereas Hoover’s
adaptations will be termed simplified Delta 1 and Delta 2, respectively. In simplified
Delta 1, the differences are added without taking the absolute values while in Delta 2
the differences are generated from the score of the items. This version was pioneered
by Hoover stating that ‘‘the results are slightly less accurate’’.32 Two series of
experiments are next described, one based on lemmas and the other on word classes.
In each of them standard Delta and simplified Deltas are employed.

3.1 Lemma-Based Burrows’s Delta and Hoover’s Deltas
The data thus obtained are the input for five different studies, characterized by the model of
Delta and the number and types of items used: a) standard Delta applied to the complete
set of lemmas; b) simplified Delta applied to the complete set of lemmas (without the
absolute differences); c) simplified Delta applied to the complete set of lemmas (without z-
scoring); d) standard Delta applied to the 150 most frequent function lemmas; and e)
standard Delta applied to the 150 most frequent content lemmas.
The relevant literature is at odds as to the appropriate input size for the
accomplishment of Delta. On the one hand, Burrows originally schemed his own
methodology through the use of the 160 most frequent items while at the same time
acknowledging that an analysis based on the 40–50 items would be more than enough
for the sake of reliability.33 Two years later, however, Hoover assessed Burrows’s
proposal somewhat rigorously with the use of a more comprehensive ranking (800
items) and the application of a culling methodology, which allowed him to conclude
that ‘‘the best results are based upon far larger numbers of words than Burrows
tested: for these texts, the maximum accuracy usually seems to occur with the 700
most frequent words. . . . The largest total number of correct attributions is achieved,
however, by removing only personal pronouns and culling at 70%.’’34
3.1.1 Standard Delta Applied to the Complete Set of Lemmas
The present experiment is accomplished with the 917 lemmas (lexical and grammatical),
which are common to the three authorial sets, that is Hamilton, Madison and Jay, so as
to carry out subsequent cullings and evaluate the consequences derived therefrom.
Table 2 reproduces the values for Delta (D) and Delta-score (Dz) for each disputed
paper along with the values for m and s, which are required for the computation of
Delta-score.35 In D49, for instance, the value for Delta is lower in Madison (3.7656)
than in Hamilton (3.8127) and Jay (4.2103), respectively, and the same trend is
mirrored if Delta-score is observed. On the grounds of the fact that the smaller Delta
becomes in a series, the less unlikeness there exists between the pieces being
compared, these data indicate that Madison is less unlike D49, and Jay, in turn,
becomes the most unlike, Hamilton remaining in-between.
The rest of the results, also plotted in Figure 1, show that the disputed Federalist Papers
are taken as less unlike Madison, except for papers D54 and D55, which seem to be less
unlike Hamilton. The odds of D55 have been highlighted by other practitioners in as
much as its particularities give traces of being more Hamiltonian than Madisonian.36
Next, the experiment is repeated to check if the same results are obtained when the
number of lemmas is reduced. Accordingly, the original list of 917 lemmas is first
culled from the bottom to contain the 10 most common lemmas (MCL) in the

the results being shown in Table 3 (wherein  stands for success and ß for failure).
The examination reveals that the same attribution is found in the range 500–700,
which stems from ruling out 417, 317 and 217 lemmas from the bottom part of the

list, and there is just one mismatch when the 10, 100 or 200 MCL are considered and
two (in D54/D55 and D56 or D62) if the list comprises the 50, 75, 150, 300, 400 and
800 MCL. Again, it is not by chance that D54 and D55 become more Hamiltonian
than Madisonian, D56 and D62 representing the other side of the coin.
From this evidence it may be safely concluded that the level of accuracy of the
present test considerably increases within the range of the 500–700 MCL.37 There is
not a general justification as to the hindrance stemming from the use of less than 500
items, but some particular diverging features have been detected as follows: 1) within
the range of the 10 MCL a sporadic use of preposition in is found in D55, if
compared with its disputed counterparts; 2) within the range of the 25 MCL
substantial differences are observed in the use of to have as an auxiliary verb or of the
noun state. In our opinion, it is yet slippery to blame these variables on account of
the number of parameters that the practitioner needs to consider simultaneously.
As expected, the results do not become so satisfactory when the list is culled from
the top inasmuch as the study deprecates the most frequent items, which are the ones
offering more conclusive data in terms of authorship attribution.
3.1.2 Simplified Delta Applied to the Complete Set of Lemmas (without taking the
absolute values of the differences)
As the results in 3.1.1 do not completely afford a satisfactory account of the
authorship of the set of the disputed papers, one of Hoover’s suggestions is here
adopted and our experiment is further replicated by averaging the differences of the
z-scores.38 The results in Table 4 corroborate once again the Madisonian composition
of the twelve disputed papers.
3.1.3 Simplified Delta Applied to the Complete Set of Lemmas (without z-scoring)
An additional test has been carried out by considering another of Hoover’s proposals,
which basically consists in the computation of Delta with the omission of the z-
scoring, assuming that the difference of the scores in the frequency list provides the
analyst with some differences once added and averaged out.39 In this experiment, the
results assign to Madison the set of the disputed papers, with the exception of D55
(see Table 5).
3.1.4 Standard Delta Applied to the 150 Most Frequent Function Lemmas
A survey of the relevant literature shows that Delta approaches have been traditionally
word-based through the analysis of the most frequent function words in the corpus. For
the sake of accuracy, however, it has also been common to disambiguate the function
words in case of homonymy as Burrows did by distinguishing word-types and word-
tokens for the accomplishment of the Delta procedure.40 Our proposal can be closely

connected with Burrows’s scheme in the sense that it is based on the analysis of the 150
most frequent function lemmas in the corpus, accordingly disambiguated beforehand.
The values of Delta and Delta-score are then reproduced in Table 6.
As observed, the results may be considered to be satisfactory in view of the fact that
all the disputed papers turn out to be more Madisonian. This experiment proves to

be accurate insofar as the exclusive use of function lemmas proves to be a higher
discriminator for authorship attribution than the complete ranking of lemmas.41
In principle, similar results are obtained in case of culling the top and/or the
bottom of the list in multiples of 25 (i.e. 25, 50, 75, 100 and 125) as shown in Table 7,
where T25 stands for the 25 top MCL, B25 stands for the 25 bottom MCL and
T25þB25 means that the 25 top MCL along with the 25 bottom MCL are not taken
into account. The output obtained thus mirrors those in Table 6 across the various
tests, not only by truncating the 25 top-most function lemmas (T25) but also the 25
bottom-most ones (B25), along with both truncations simultaneously. Therefore, the
data come to validate the positive effect of this test of truncation.
3.1.5 Standard Delta Applied to the 150 Most Frequent Content Lemmas
The present experiment is carried out assuming that the results will not be so precise
as those based on the analysis of function lemmas since the set of the 150 content
lemmas is, in large part, less frequent than the set of function items. In other words,
the higher in the list, the more relative weight a given element has. As expected, an
analysis of the results reveals that five of them are wrongly attributed (i.e. D53, D54,
D56, D57 and D62), considered to be more similar to Hamilton than to Madison
while D55, on the other hand, cannot be singled out in terms of content lemmas
(Table 8).42

3.2 POS-Based Standard and Simplified Delta
This section evaluates whether the rate of occurrence of the different word classes in
the corpus of The Federalist Papers is a reliable fingerprint for authorship attribution.
In a pilot approach to word-class distribution, Mosteller and Wallace computed the
percentage of nouns and adjectives for each paper which served to build a statistic
intending to separate Hamilton’s from Madison’s writings ‘‘by giving high scores to
Hamilton’s writings and low to Madison’s’’.43 The statistic was then called linear
discriminant function and was found to provide suggestive calculations, but was not
conclusive whatsoever. Table 9 presents the distribution of each word class both in
the disputed and the undisputed samples, as generated with TexSEn.

The percentages for the different classes across the different hands made us
deprecate this parameter as a discriminator between the hands of Madison and
Hamilton, although a prospective study led us to attempt their use with Delta.
3.2.1 Standard Delta Applied to Word Classes
To carry out the experiment, two POS-tagged corpora have been used: a) a model
corpus comprising the complete writings of Hamilton, Madison and Jay; and b) a test
corpus containing the specimens of the disputed papers. After calculating Delta as
explained in the introduction to section 3, the results are reproduced in Table 10
below.
The examination of these data allows the analyst to gather that the values for
Madison are, in general, lower than those for Hamilton and Jay. Figure 2 plots the

results obtained across the different samples, which are all considered to be less unlike
Madison with the exception of D54, D57, D62 and D63.
3.2.2 Simplified Delta Applied to Word Classes (without taking the absolute values)
In view of the positive assessment of Hoover’s modification of the original Delta in
3.1.2, an additional test has been carried out with the same procedure (Table 11). The
application of this modality of Delta (without the absolute differences) enhances the
reliability of the study inasmuch as the twelve disputed papers are considered to be
less unlike Madison, as can be observed in Figure 3.

3.2.3 Simplified Delta Applied to Word Classes (without z-scoring)
In order to keep the parallelism with the lemma-based study, the second
simplified version of Delta is experimented as in 3.1.3, and the results are shown
in Table 12.
In view of the results, the experiment is observed to gain somewhat in accuracy if
compared with standard Delta in the sense that three disputed papers (D54, D62 and
D63) are considered to be less unlike Madison, D57 standing out as less unlike
Hamilton. However, this simplified version of Delta does not reach the level of
success observed in 3.2.2 when the differences to be added are not taken as absolute
values neglecting thus whether they are positive or negative.
4. Conclusions
In the present paper an annotated corpus of The Federalist Papers has been processed
to assess the benefits of this kind of corpora in authorship attribution studies. There
is nowadays common ground among scholars, both historians and statisticians, to
assign the disputed samples to Madison’s penmanship. The gist of our contribution,
therefore, is not attribution in itself but the testing of Delta with lemmas and word
classes, which proves to be successful to a certain extent.
The analysis of lemma-based Delta, on the one hand, has been accomplished from
five different perspectives. The first employs the ranking of the 917 MCL in the
corpus of The Federalist Papers finding enough evidence to assign correctly ten
disputed writings to Madison, but for papers D54 and D55, the latter overwhelmingly

deemed the odd one out in the relevant literature.44 In the second, the application of
simplified Delta 1 (without the absolute differences) yields the correct attribution of
the whole set to Madison. Third, in the particular case of simplified Delta 2, the only
exception is paper D55. The fourth experiment, in turn, examines the weight of the
150 most frequent function lemmas and assigns the complete set of the disputed
papers unmistakably to Madison. Fifth, the use of lexical lemmas is not deemed so
successful because five papers turn out to be wrongly attributed (i.e. D53, D54, D56,
D57 and D62).
The analysis of POS-based Delta, on the other hand, can also be positively evaluated
for authorial purposes, though the results may vary considerably. First, the application
of standard Delta fails to identify the authorship of four disputed samples, that is D54,
D57, D62 and D63. Second, the implementation of simplified Delta 1 drastically improves
the accuracy as the twelve disputed papers are considered to be less Hamiltonian than
Madisonian. Third, the use of simplified Delta 2 leads us to assign correctly all but three
disputed writings (D54, D62 and D63). These three experiments, therefore, shed light on
the beneficial effect of POS-based variables in combination with Delta.
Another minor conclusion may be derived from the expediency of truncations in
this kind of stylometric approaches as in the majority of cases the truncations
confirm the results obtained from the analysis of the complete lists, the controversial
papers being also included as is D55, for the reasons mentioned above.
All in all, the results shown in Table 13 lead us to highlight the bounties of Delta in
the field of authorship attribution, both in terms of its reliability and its versatility in
as much as it allows approaches from manifold perspectives, not only from the
traditional word-based scheme but also from other models based on lemmatization
and grammatical characterization. In addition, they allow us to claim that the use of
function lemmas and Delta secure the highest level of accuracy for authorship
attribution, especially when only function lemmas are involved or when the

differences are not made absolute, which is also valid when word-classes are
employed. Moreover, the rate of success in these experiments matches the one
obtained with word tokens in a previous study.45
