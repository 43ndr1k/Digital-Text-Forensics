Abstract_ In the present research work, we deal with the problem of authorship attribution of 
ancient Arabic text documents, which were written by several ancient philosophers. For that 
purpose, we conducted several authorship attribution experiments applied with different text 
sizes. A special dataset, called “A4P” (Authorship Attribution for Ancient Arabic 
Philosophers), has been constructed by extracting texts of different sizes from the books of 
those 5 ancient Arabic philosophers, where the genre and topic are quite similar. The size of the 
texts varies from 100 words to 3000 words per text. In our approach two types of features are 
employed; character N-grams and words and several classifiers are used, namely: SMO based 
SVM, Multi Layer Perceptron, Linear Regression, Stamatatos distance and Manhattan distance. 
Results show that the minimum required text size (for getting good authorship attribution 
performances) depends on the used features and classification technique, but in the overall the 
performances of the proposed techniques are quite interesting.  
 
Keywords: Authorship attribution, Performances vs size, Pattern recognition, Artificial 
intelligence. 
 
1. Introduction and related works 
 
Authorship Attribution (AA) is a research field concerned with the automatic classification of 
text documents with regards to their author(s). It tries to respond to the following question: Who 
is the author of this document?

Many studies have been reported during the last decades as described in [Juola 2006], 
[Stamatatos 2009] and [Sayoud 2015], where many disputes were reported and several types of 
features and techniques were proposed too. In most cases the amount of data was big enough to 
bring significant characteristics to the author. 
However, in 2001, de Vel, Anderson, Corney and Mohay [Vel 2001] reported a challenging 
research work of author identification on small texts such as in emails. The problem in such 
works is: was the small data provided by an email sufficient enough to make a fair author 
identification? Even though several works conducted on email documents reported quite good 
results too, their works were not so convincing since the scientific community agree that an 
efficient authorship attribution requires a quite big amount of text. In other words: the longer is 
the text, the higher is the precision of authorship attribution. 
Now, what could be the minimum/optimum data size for that purpose? Some recent studies 
developed by Kim Luyckx and Walter Daelemans in 2011 [Luyckx 2011] tried to investigate 
the size issue and showed the real effect of author data size in authorship attribution. Afterward, 
an interesting work was reported by Maciej Eder in 2013 [Eder 2013], giving several responses 
to the problem by providing some key solutions to the minimum data size required for different 
cases and different languages, except for the oriental languages such as Arabic for instance (i.e. 
those types of languages were not investigated). 
The results of Eder were interesting and useful, but we cannot extend them to all the languages 
that were not investigated, such as Arabic. Moreover, certain features were not tested by the 
author, which make his results, even though interesting, not extensible to every feature or 
classifier either. 
That is, by the present investigation, we try to find out the minimum text size required to get a 
consistent authorship characterization for the Arabic Language. For that purpose, different types 
of features, distances and classifiers are tested and commented. 
 
2. Dataset  
 
The corpus used in our experiments consists of 45 text documents from 5 different authors, 
namely: 9 texts per author. These texts were written by five ancient Arabic philosophers 
(without translation) from various regions and date from the 11
th
, 12
th
 and 13
th
 centuries. 
Moreover, those texts have somewhat the same genre and topic. The original texts are quite 
long, but are divided herein into medium and short texts, so that we get several fixed sizes: the 
shortest text is about only 100 words and the longest one is about 3000 words. Hence, the 
different text sizes are 100, 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500 and 3000 words per text.  
Those different texts (the 5 philosophers) are extracted from the Universal Library (Elwaraq).   
During our experiments, the corpus was arbitrarily divided into two subsets, one subset for the 
training and another one for the testing. The training corpus, used to train each author model is 
composed of 10 long texts of 3000 words and the testing corpus is composed of 35 different 
texts.

To our knowledge, most researchers, in the literature, used their own text corpus for the task of 
author attribution. Although the Greek corpus Stamatatos et al. (1999) [Stamatatos 1999] and 
Chinese corpus Peng et al. (2003) [Peng 2003] were included in Keselj et al. (2003) [Keselj 
2003] for instance, unfortunately they were forced, like us, to assemble their Arabic corpus from 
classical texts (eg. Ibn Roched, Elfarabi, etc.). Finally, for purposes of further comparison, the 
entire corpus, which we built (A4P), has been made freely available on our personal website. 
 
 
 
3. Results and discussion 
In this paper, we were looking for the minimum text size for a given document able to ensure a 
good AI task.  For that purpose, we have conducted several experiments of Authorship 
identification applied on multi-size text documents: from 3000 words down to only 100 words 
per document. For that purpose an Arabic dataset has been constructed and collected from the 
books of 5 ancient Arabic philosophers.Two types of features were investigated: chacter 5-gram 
and words. Furthermore, several classifiers were employed: SMO-SVM, MLP, Linear 
regression, Stamatatos distance and Manhattan distance.  
Results have shown that the minimum text size required for performing a fair Authorship 
Identification, depends on the features and classification method that are employed. But, in 
general, the size of 2500 words per document seems to be the minimum amount of textual data 
required for a fair AI, in many cases. Furthermore, concerning the Robustness vs Size-
Reduction, an interesting conclusion has been deduced from this survey. For instance, when 
using character 5-grams the MLP appears to be the most interesting classifier to use in AI; and 
when using words, Manhattan distance appears to be the most interesting one. In general, the 
feature character penta-gram seems better than words by showing much better performances 
than this last one for almost all classifiers. The unique exception is noticed with Manhattan 
distance, which presents a paradoxical result showing that the word feature is quite better than 
character n-grams.
