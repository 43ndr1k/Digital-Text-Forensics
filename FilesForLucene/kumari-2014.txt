ABSTRACT  
Web pages are discriminated based on their topic and genre. 
Web page genres are capable to improve the modern search 
engines to focus on the user’s information need. In this paper, 
web pages are represented using character n-grams. Character 
n-gram representation is language independent and allows 
automatic extraction of features from a web page. Character 
n-gram representation of a web page can be used efficiently to 
classify a web page by genre. Support Vector Machine (SVM) 
classification model is used for classification and experiments 
were carried out on 7-Genre corpus by varying the length of 
n-grams. It is observed that the performance in terms of F-
measure improves as n-gram lengths are varied from 3 to 5 
and it is also observed that performance degrades as the n-
gram length is further increased.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Web page genre classification is helpful in filtering the results 
of online searches. In order to classify Web pages by genre, it 
is necessary to extract features that effectively separate each 
web page and genre. In web page genre classification, web 
pages are represented through different ways such as 
keywords, n-grams, POS tags, HTML tags, URL contents, 
document level features, genre relevant words etc. 
An n-gram is defined as an n-word, n-character or n-byte 
substring of a given string. Word n-grams are simply 
sequences of n consecutive words. Character n-grams use 
letters only and a non-letter character is substituted by a 
space, and two or more consecutive spaces are replaced by a 
single space. An underscore character is used to represent the 
space. Byte n-grams are unprocessed form of character n-
grams in which no bytes are excluded, including the 
whitespace characters.  
There are several advantages of n-gram feature extraction 
method over other feature extraction methods such as 1) N-
grams capture the stems of the words automatically. For 
example, the words extraction, extracting and extracted are 
different, but they have some common n-grams, 2) N-grams 
are capable of dealing with OCR (Optical Character 
Recognition) generated errors, or orthographic errors done by 
humans and 3) N-grams are language independent. The key 
limitation of n-gram feature extraction is, as the length of the 
n-gram increases, dimensionality of feature set will increase 
[20]. 
An n-gram representation of web page is language 
independent [7][8][9]. An n-gram method can be comfortably 
applied to any language and also to non-language data such as 
music and DNA [16][17]. It sufficiently obtains the 
characteristics of web page and can be easily adapted to the 
properties of the emerging web genres in the World Wide 
Web. An n-gram feature extraction doesn’t require any text 
preprocessing or higher level processing, so it avoids the 
requirement for use of taggers, parsers and stemmers in the 
feature selection, or any other language-dependent and non-
trivial NLP tools. 
In this paper, web pages are represented using fixed-length 
character n-grams. Character n-grams of different lengths 
(n=3 to 8) are considered. Experiments were run on 7-Genre 
corpus [12]. SVM classifier is applied for classification of 
web genres. The classification results show that n-gram of 
length five gave better results. The results obtained were 
compared with the existing work. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 gives 
an overview of the related work on webpage genre 
classification and web page representation. Section 3 
describes the extraction of character n-gram features and the 
corpus used in this work. In Section 4, the results of the 
experiments and comparison to previous work are discussed. 
Finally, Section 5 concludes the paper with future work 
directions. 
2. RELATED WORK 
This section deals with work related to n-gram representation 
of web page and web page genre classification. Web page 
genre classification is described in terms of three factors: the 
set of genres, the features used to represent web pages in each 
genre and the classification algorithm used to distinguish 
genres. 
Web genre palette consisting of eight genres: article, 
download, link collection, portrayal-private, discussion, help, 
portrayal-non private and shop called as KI-04 corpus [10] 
based on web genre usefulness. In [13], a collection of 20 
genre labels: Adult, Blog, Children’s, Commercial, 
Community, Content delivery, Entertainment, Error message, 
FAQ, Gateway, Index, Informative, Journalistic, Official, 
Personal, Poetry, Prose fiction, Scientific, Shopping and User 
input were  allowing multiple labels to be assigned to one 
webpage. Although there are certain resemblances in genre

14 
corpora (e.g. personal home page, listing etc.) it is not clear 
how each genre of one corpus is associated to the genres of 
another corpus. Home pages and non-home pages are 
distinguished in [4] and classified as personal home pages, 
corporate home pages and organizational home pages genres. 
[13] Focused on PDF web documents and a collection of six 
genres: academic monograph, business report, book of fiction, 
minutes, periodicals, and thesis. Issues related to corpus, 
features and classification algorithms discussed in [14] drawn 
conclusions from experiments on a focused genre palette may 
be misleading since features found to be useful in some genres 
are not equally effective in other genres. 
Generally, the features used to represent webpage in webpage 
genre classification are a combination of different features. 
Bag-of-words, part-of-speech tags, various punctuation 
symbols, and function words, document level such as: 
sentence length, number of words and word length are used as 
feature set in [1], URL features [2], HTML tags [3] and Bag-
of-words [6]. 
Combined stemming approach (CSA) is proposed in [15] to 
extract root words and genre relevant words. Random Forest 
machine learning algorithm was used on 7-Genre corpus for 
classification. To identify home pages on the Web [4] used 
features as triple: content, form and functionality. Content, 
form, functionality and positioning features are used by [5] to 
identify front pages of news paper on the web. Kanaris [9] 
proposed a function called as ‘glue’ that sticks the characters 
together within an n-gram. The proposed function considered 
3-grams and 5-grams against 4-grams, since they can capture 
both sub-word and inter-word information. The n-gram 
features can reduce problems derived from typographical 
errors and spelling mistakes done by humans [19]. Byte n-
grams by Mason J. in [18], and the combination of bag of 
words, genre relevant words, Part-of-speech (POS) tags and 
HTML tags by Santini M. [12] were considered as features 
and genre classification was performed by using SVM 
classifier. 
3. EXPERIMENTS 
3.1 Web genre corpus  
7-Genre corpus was built in early 2005, comprising seven 
genres identified by Santini M. reported in [12] and consists 
of 1,400 English web pages as shown in Table 1. It is a 
balanced corpus in which each genre comprised of equal 
number of web pages.7-Genre corpus construction followed 
the criteria of annotation by objective sources and consistent 
genre granularity except listing.

3.2 Classification model 
The classification model used in this paper is Support Vector 
Machine (SVM). The SVM method is a popular and well 
known supervised machine learning method which performs 
classification by constructing an N-dimensional hyper plane 
that optimally separates the data. The vectors near the hyper 
plane are the support vectors. 
3.3. Character n-gram extraction 
The representation of web page using character n-grams is 
mainly dependent on the length of the n-gram. Character n-
grams are sequence of ‘n’ characters where ‘n’ is equal to the 
length of n-gram. Character n-grams of length 3 to 8 were 
extracted and the n-gram feature set was selected using term 
frequency (TF). TF was calculated based on the number of 
occurrences of each n-gram in a web page.  
3.4 Performance evaluation measures 
The classifier performance was evaluated in this paper by 
using classifier performance measures precision, recall, F-
measure and accuracy. Precision is the number of correctly 
classified true positive instances by the number of instances 
labeled by the system as positive. Recall is the number of 
correctly classified true positive instances divided by the 
number of positive instances in the data. F-measure is the 
harmonic mean of precision and recall.

4. RESULT ANALYSIS 
This section describes the results of the experiments carried 
out on 7-genre corpus. Character n-grams of different lengths 
(n=3 to 8) were tested on 7-genre corpus and 10-fold cross-
validation was used for the experiments with this corpus. The 
classification was done using SVM classifier and the 
classification results are shown in Table 2 and Figure 1 
respectively. The experimental results obtained on the 7-
Genre corpus in terms of F-measure are shown in Table 2. By 
analyzing the results of Table 2, it is found that the 
performance improved by incrementing the value of ‘n’ from 
3 to 5 and started declining from 6 onwards. For n-gram of 
length 5, better classification results were obtained, as 5-gram 
captures most of the root words in English web pages. 
Genre wise comparison of mean precision, recall and F-
measure are shown in Table 4, which indicates that as the n-
gram length is increased from 3 to 5, the precision, recall and 
F-measure are improving and from 6 onwards it degrades. It is 
concluded that using an n-gram of length 5 gave better 
classification results in terms of precision, recall and F-
measure as it captures most of the English words and stems. 
The advantage of 5-gram is it maintains the dimensionality of

Table 3 summarizes the comparison of classifier performance 
with existing research [9], [12], [15] and [18]. Santini M. [12] 
considered the combination of bag of words, genre relevant 
words, Part-of-speech (POS) tags and HTML tags as features 
and classification was done using SVM classifier. Kanaris [9] 
considered the combination of character 3-grams and 5-grams 
respectively and SVM model was applied to build the 
webpage genre classifier. Byte n-grams were considered as 
features by Mason J. [18], and classification was performed 
using optimal threshold method. Combined stemming 
approach (CSA) [15] used genre relevant words as features 
and Random Forest machine learning algorithm was used for 
classification. From Table 3 and Figure 2, it is clear that, by 
considering the character n-grams of length 5 gave better 
classification performance results on 7-genre corpus.

5. CONCLUSION 
A low-level feature extraction approach called as character n-
grams were used for webpage genre classification. The 
classification results obtained show that, n-gram length is 
important in the web page genre classification. An n-gram of 
length five gave better results on 7-genre data set, as 5-gram 
captures most of the root words in English web pages. 
Applying n-gram method on Indian languages in web page 
genre classification can be considered as a future work. N-
grams are much less sensitive to OCR-generated errors. When 
dealing with languages that require non-trivial feature 
extraction, n-grams provide a language-independent feature 
extraction technique.
