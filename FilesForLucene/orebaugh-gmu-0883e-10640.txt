The anonymous nature of the Internet and increasing cybercrime creates a 
growing need for techniques to assist in identifying online cybercrime suspects as part of 
the investigation.  In instant messaging (IM) communications, cyber criminals use virtual 
identities to hide their true identity, which hinders social accountability and facilitates 
cybercrime.  Cyber criminals may use multiple screen names, impersonate other users, or 
supply false information on their virtual identities with the intention of deceiving 
unsuspecting victims and committing various cybercrimes.  It is necessary to have IM 
cyber forensics techniques to assist in identifying cyber criminals and collecting digital 
evidence as part of the investigation. 
Behavioral biometrics are persistent personal traits and patterns of behavior that 
may be collected and analyzed to aid a cybercrime investigation.  Instant messaging 
 
 xvi 
behavioral biometrics include online writing habits, known as stylometric features, which 
may be used to create an author writeprint to assist in identifying an author, or 
characteristics of an author, of a set of instant messages.  The writeprint is a digital 
fingerprint that represents an author’s distinguishing stylometric features that occur in 
his/her computer-mediated communications.  Writeprints can provide cybercrime 
investigators a unique tool for analyzing IM-assisted cybercrimes.  They may be used as 
input to a criminal cyberprofile and as an element of a multimodal system for cybercrime 
investigations.  Writeprints can be used in conjunction with other evidence, investigation 
techniques, and biometrics techniques to reduce the potential suspect space to a certain 
subset of suspects; identify the most plausible author of an IM conversation from a group 
of suspects; link related crimes; develop an interview and interrogation strategy; and 
gather convincing digital evidence to justify search and seizure and provide probable 
cause. 
The purpose of this dissertation is to create and analyze behavioral biometrics-
based instant messaging writeprints as cyber forensics input for cybercrime 
investigations.  This research uses authorship analysis techniques to create a set of 
stylometric features robust enough to show separation between authors and between 
author categories.  The real time, casual nature of instant messaging communications 
offers several interesting stylometric features such as message structure, unusual 
language usage, and special stylistic markers that are useful in forming a suitable 
writeprint feature set for authorship analysis.  This research uses the Principal 
Component Analysis (PCA) and multivariate Gaussian distribution (MGD) methods to 
 
 xvii 
analyze IM conversation logs from two distinct data sets for authorship identification and 
characterization.  Authorship identification may be applied to IM to assist in identifying 
criminals who hide their true identity or impersonate a known individual.  Authorship 
characterization may be used to help discover IM cyber criminals who supply false 
information in their virtual identities, such as gender. 
The research results presented in this dissertation demonstrate that authors show 
separation via IM writeprints.  IM writeprints are shown to group messages belonging to 
a particular author from a set of authors and to group messages belonging to a particular 
author category from a set of author categories.  By demonstrating high authorship 
identification and characterization probability, the research results presented in this 
dissertation indicate a promising future for applying authorship analysis as an element of 
a multimodal biometrics system to assist with cyber forensics and cybercrime 
investigations.

1.  INTRODUCTION 
 
 
 
The Internet has evolved from a resource of simple information sharing and 
exchange to a conglomeration of virtual communications and e-commerce activities.  One 
increasingly popular use of the Internet is computer-mediated communication (CMC).  
CMC includes any communicative transaction, which occurs through the use of two or 
more networked computers [McQ2010].  CMC includes the use of asynchronous or 
synchronous online textual messages [Her2002].  Asynchronous CMC occurs in delayed 
time and does not require simultaneous participation of users, such as e-mail, web 
forums, newsgroups, and weblogs.  Synchronous CMC occurs in real time and requires 
the simultaneous participation of users, such as instant messaging (IM) and chat rooms. 
CMC may also be multicast or point-to-point.  Multicast CMC is online text 
intended for multiple recipients, for example group chat rooms.  Point-to-point CMC is 
online text intended for a single recipient, for example instant messaging.  This 
dissertation is focused on the analysis of instant messaging, a synchronous form of point-
to-point CMC with the following characteristics: 
• Message authors use a virtual identity. 
 
 2 
• The recipient of the messages is a single individual1. 
• Messages contain a style and vocabulary unique to IM [KCAC2008]. 
CMC generates large amounts of textual data, providing interesting research 
opportunities for analyzing such data.  CMC is unique in that it is often referred to as 
written speech.  Its informal nature contains many stylistic differences from literary texts 
including word usage, spelling and grammar errors, lack of punctuation, and 
abbreviations.  Instant messaging’s unique characteristics and stylistic differences 
distinguish it from other types of literary texts as well as other types of online 
communications, making it an especially interesting research area. 
1.1  Instant Messaging Architecture 
 Today’s instant messaging services grew from their online chat medium 
predecessor known as Internet Relay Chat (IRC).  Unlike e-mail, IM provides a user the 
ability to view the current online status of other users and interact with active users in real 
time.  Most instant messaging occurs over the public Internet, but more organizations are 
now implementing internal messaging servers.  Examples of IM services include AOL 
Instant Messenger (AIM), I Seek You (ICQ), Skype, MSN Messenger, Google Talk, and 
Yahoo! Messenger.  CMC differs from Short Message Service (SMS), in that users 
communicate using their cell phone to send short text messages to other cell phone users.  
Some IM services support Mobile Instant Messaging (MIM), which allows IM users to 
forward messages from the IM service to their cell phone as text messages [Cro2008].  
                                                 
1 Instant messaging may also be used for multicast group chat sessions with multiple individuals.  Group 
chat is beyond the scope of this research. 
 
 3 
IM also continues to be incorporated into a number of other technologies, including game 
systems such as the Xbox or PlayStation. 
 The instant messaging architecture consists of a network, clients, and servers.  Most 
IM networks use a client-server model in which a service provider maintains the server.  
Users register themselves with the service provider and download a compatible client for 
use on the service provider network.  By registering, the user creates an account that 
consists of a unique identifier such as a name or number, also called a screen name.  The 
screen name and its associated information become the user’s virtual identity.  The user 
provides his/her screen name to other users with whom he or she wants to communicate 
via the instant messaging network.  Users authenticate to the central server using their 
screen name and password entered into the client to begin conversing with other users of 
the network commonly known as buddies or friends.  Buddies are added to and 
maintained in a Buddy List, which shows when users are logged on for communication.  
Users can add, remove, and block buddies in the Buddy List.  Users may communicate 
with a single buddy privately or several buddies in a group setting.  Users communicate 
via an interactive window that displays the conversation as it occurs.  When two 
authenticated users (e.g., Alice and Bob) want to communicate, the following sequence 
occurs: 
• Alice creates a message to send to Bob. 
• Alice’s IM client creates a packet containing the message and sends it to the 
server. 
 
 4 
• The server looks at the packet and determines that the recipient is Bob. 
• The server creates a new packet with the message from Alice and sends it to 
Bob. 
• Bob’s IM client receives the packet containing the message and presents the 
message to Bob [Hin2003]. 
 Some instant messaging services will continue to send all subsequent messages via 
the central server.  However, some IM services create a direct connection between the 
user’s clients after the first message [Hin2003].  The use of a central server is beneficial 
in the following ways: 
• A user only needs to know the unique identifier of a buddy to communicate 
with him/her. 
• Some IM servers allow users to send messages to a buddy even if he/she is not 
online.  The server will store the messages until the buddy authenticates with 
the server, at which time they are sent to him/her [Hin2003]. 
• A central server may log all conversations between users. 
 Popular IM service provider networks include AOL, Google, Yahoo, and MSN.  
Each of these networks provides a compatible client for communication.  However, each 
service provider currently uses a different protocol, making them incompatible with each 
other.  For example, an AOL IM user can only communicate with other AOL IM users.  
Some clients, such as Trillian and Pidgin, can connect to multiple service provider 
networks at one time.  However, the user must maintain a registered account on each of 
 
 5 
the service provider networks that he/she wishes to use.   
 IM clients each contain a variety of features including multimedia, customization, 
and logging.  Some IM clients allow users to transmit files and to stream audio and video.  
Users may also create and display customized status messages, letting buddies know 
when they are away or busy.  Most clients allow logging of IM conversations.  IM 
conversations are logged in a simple text format, making it easy for a researcher to parse 
and analyze conversation data.  Logged conversations may also be used as evidence 
during an investigation.  This dissertation uses two distinct datasets of IM conversation 
logs for analysis. 
1.2  Instant Messaging and Cybercrime 
Cybercrime could include any criminal activity that is committed with the aid of a 
computer or communication device in a network, such as the Internet, telephone lines, or 
mobile networks such as cellular communication [FM2008].  Instant messaging’s 
anonymity hinders social accountability and leads to IM-assisted cybercrime facilitated 
by the following: 
• Users can create any virtual identity. 
• Users can log in from anywhere. 
• Files can be transmitted. 
• Communication is often transmitted unencrypted.   
 
 6 
In IM communications, cyber criminals use virtual identities to hide their true 
identity.  They can use multiple screen names or impersonate other users with the 
intention of harassing or deceiving unsuspecting victims.  Cyber criminals may also 
supply false information on their virtual identities, for example a male user may 
configure his virtual identity to appear as female.  Since most IM systems use the public 
Internet, the risk is high that usernames and passwords may be intercepted, or an attacker 
may hijack a connection or launch a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack [Ore2004a, 
Ore2006a].  With hijacking and MITM attacks, the victim user thinks he/she is 
communicating with a buddy but is really communicating with the attacker 
masquerading as the victim’s buddy [Ore2005a, OBB2005b].  Instant messaging’s 
anonymity allows cyber criminals such as pedophiles, scam artists, and stalkers to make 
contact with their victims and get to know those they target for their crimes [Cro2008].  
IM-assisted cybercrimes, such as phishing, social engineering, threatening, cyber 
bullying, hate speech and crimes, child exploitation, sexual harassment, and illegal sales 
and distribution of software are continuing to increase [MD2000].  Additionally, 
criminals such as terrorist groups, gangs, and cyber intruders use IM to communicate 
[AC2005].  Criminals also use IM to transmit worms, viruses, Trojan horses, and other 
malware over the Internet. 
With increasing IM cybercrime, there is a growing need for techniques to assist in 
identifying online cybercrime suspects as part of the investigation [AC2006].  Cyber 
forensics is the application of investigation and analysis techniques to gather evidence 
suitable for presentation in a court of law with the goal of discovering the crime that took 
 
 7 
place and who was responsible [BBO2006].  With IM communications, it is necessary to 
have cyber forensics techniques to assist in determining the IM user’s real identity and 
collect digital evidence for investigators and law enforcement [OA2009a, OA2009b, 
OA2010b].  This dissertation explores the cyber forensic technique of behavioral 
biometrics to assist in identifying cyber criminals and collecting data for the 
investigation. 
1.2.1  Behavioral Biometrics 
In traditional forensic science, fingerprints uniquely identify individuals.  With the 
absence of physical fingerprints, the anonymous nature of the Internet and use of virtual 
identities presents a critical challenge for cybercrime investigation.  Fortunately, 
individuals often leave behind textual identity traces in cyberspace, which may be used to 
aid a cybercrime investigation [AC2008].  Determining an IM user’s real identity relies 
on the fact that humans are creatures of habit and have certain persistent personal traits 
and patterns of behavior, known as behavioral biometrics [Rev2008].  
Behavioral biometrics are measurable traits that are acquired over time (versus a 
physiological characteristic or physical trait) that can be used to recognize or verify the 
identity of a person [Bio2006].  For example, handwriting style is consistent throughout a 
person’s life, even though it may vary with age.  As with handwriting, users have certain 
online writing habits that are unconscious and deeply ingrained [TLML2004].  Even if a 
cyber criminal made a conscious effort to disguise his/her style, disguise would be 
difficult to achieve.  Online writing habits, known as stylometric features, include 
 
 8 
composition syntax and layout, vocabulary patterns, unique language usage, and other 
stylistic traits.  Writer’s have certain stylometric features that remain consistent across 
multiple texts of a given author, but differ in texts of different authors.  Thus, certain 
stylometric features may be used to create an author writeprint to help identify an author 
of a particular piece of work [DACM2001b].   
A writeprint represents an author’s distinguishing stylometric features that occur in 
his/her computer-mediated communications.  These stylometric features may include 
average word length, use of punctuation and special characters, use of abbreviations, and 
other stylistic traits.  The principal challenge with writeprint analysis is the creation of a 
set of stylometric features robust enough to show separation between various authors.   
Writeprints can provide cybercrime investigators a unique behavioral biometric 
tool for analyzing IM-assisted cybercrimes.  Writeprints can be used as input to a 
cyberprofile and as an element of a multimodal system to perform cyber forensics and 
cybercrime investigations [JRS2004, RLG2009].  This dissertation uses authorship 
analysis techniques to create an author’s IM writeprint based on behavioral biometrics. 
1.2.2  Authorship Analysis 
Authorship analysis is the process of examining the stylometric features of a 
document to identify or validate the text’s author, or information about the author.  
Authorship analysis uses a variety of computer-aided statistical methods to analyze text.  
Authorship analysis techniques include authorship identification – methods to determine 
the most plausible author of a piece of text, and authorship characterization – methods to 
 
 9 
infer an author’s background characteristics based sociolinguistic attributes such as 
gender, age, educational background, linguistic background, ethnicity, and psychological 
status.  Authorship identification may be applied to IM to assist in identifying cyber 
criminals who hide their true identity or impersonate a known individual.  Authorship 
characterization may be used to help discover IM cyber criminals who supply false 
information in their virtual identities, such as gender.  Authorship analysis uses a variety 
of stylometric features that can be derived from a particular piece of work to facilitate 
authorship identification or characterization. 
Instant messaging communications contain several stylometric features for 
authorship analysis research.  Certain IM specific features such as message structure, 
unusual language usage, and special stylistic markers are useful in forming a suitable 
writeprint feature set for authorship analysis [ZLCH2006].  The style of IM messages is 
very different than that of any other text used in traditional literature or other forms of 
computer-mediated communication.  The continuous nature of synchronous 
communication makes it especially interesting since authors take less time to craft their 
responses [HPR2003].  The real time, casual nature of IM messages produces text that is 
conversational in style and reflects the author’s true writing style and vocabulary 
[KCAC2008].  Significant characteristics of IM are the use of special linguistic elements 
such as abbreviations, and computer and Internet terms, known as netlingo.  The textual 
nature of IM also creates a need to exhibit emotions.  Emotion icons, called emoticons, 
are sequences of punctuation marks commonly used to represent feelings within 
computer-mediated text [KCAC2008].  An author’s IM writeprint may be derived from 
 
 10 
network packet captures or application data logged during an instant messaging 
conversation.  Although some types of digital evidence, such as source IP addresses, file 
timestamps, and metadata may be easily manipulated, author writeprints based on 
behavioral biometrics are unique to an individual and difficult to imitate [DACM2001b].  
This dissertation uses the data obtained from two unique datasets of synchronous, point-
to-point instant messaging logs. 
The nature of IM conversations also include several characteristics that make 
authorship analysis challenging:  
• IM text is typically brief. 
• The short length of online messages may cause some identifying features in 
normal texts, such as vocabulary richness, to be ineffective [ZLCH2006]. 
• Conversation beginning and end is difficult to determine. 
• Messages often have spelling errors and do not follow formal grammar and 
structure standards. 
• Authors’ style can evolve over time (authors learn new emoticons, 
abbreviations, netlingo, etc.). 
• Messages contain free-form unstructured text with few sentences or 
paragraphs. 
• Unlike e-mail, IM has no standard header, greetings or farewells, or 
signatures. 
 
 11 
This dissertation uses authorship analysis and statistical techniques to create and 
analyze IM writeprints to assist in identifying an author, as well as certain characteristics 
of the author of a set of IM messages.  Thus far, the research community has begun to use 
behavioral biometrics-based authorship analysis techniques as a cyber forensics tool with 
recent application to e-mail and online forums. 
1.3  Proposed Research 
The purpose of this research is to create and analyze behavioral biometrics-based 
instant messaging writeprints to assist in identifying online cyber criminals and collecting 
digital evidence as part of the investigation.  The research uses authorship analysis 
techniques to create an IM-specific stylometric feature set taxonomy to show separation 
between authors and between author categories.  The research uses Principal Component 
Analysis (PCA) and multivariate Gaussian distribution (MGD) statistical methods to 
analyze author writeprints from IM conversation logs from two distinct datasets for 
authorship identification and characterization.   
In the context of instant messaging, the goals of this research are the following: 
1. Create writeprints that show separation between authors and author categories, 
2. Create writeprints that can differentiate messages belonging to a particular 
author Ai from a set of authors {A1,…,An}, and 
3. Create writeprints that can differentiate messages belonging to a particular 
author category Ci, from a set of author categories {C1,…,Cm} based on 
sociolinguistic attributes. 
 
 12 
1.4  Scope and Delimitations 
This research creates author writeprints from IM conversations from two unique 
datasets of synchronous, point-to-point instant messaging logs.  Based on the two datasets 
used, the scope of this research is the following: 
1. Create an IM feature set taxonomy, 
2. Using PCA, reduce the dimensions and show separation in author and author 
category writeprints, 
3. Using MGD, determine the authorship identification and characterization 
probability of authors and author categories in the two datasets, and 
4. Determine the conversation size that provides the highest probability for 
authorship identification and characterization based on the number of authors 
in the given test set. 
Authorship analysis identification results greater than 70% are acceptable during 
an investigation process [IBFD2013]. 
IM writeprints are not proposed to be the sole method of determining authorship 
identification and characterization in cybercrime investigations.  IM writeprints may be 
used as an element in a multimodal biometrics systems in conjunction with traditional 
investigation techniques to assist with cybercrime decision support. 
 
 13 
1.5  Assumptions 
For the purpose of this research the data used in the datasets has been manually 
cleaned of noise (i.e. quoted text, timestamps, usernames, automatic away message 
responses, and other metadata) during pre-processing.  The scope of this research is 
bound by the following assumptions: 
1. In the utilized datasets, the data for each author contains text from only that 
author between known pairs of communicators.  Authorship has been 
validated to the greatest extent possible during data collection and via chain of 
custody.  The IM conversations are point-to-point with no known third party 
interference.  There may be limitations through unidentified noise. 
2. The messages were not purposely crafted to imitating another user.  To all 
extent possible there is no known intentional masquerading of other authors. 
1.6  Summary of Contributions 
As cybercrimes continue to increase, new cyber forensics techniques are needed to 
combat the constant challenge of Internet anonymity [Ore2006c].  Current IM products 
are not addressing the anonymity and ease of impersonation over instant messaging.  
Cyber forensic techniques are needed to assist cybercrime decision support tools in 
collecting and analyzing digital evidence, discovering characteristics about the cyber 
criminal, and assisting in identifying cyber criminal suspects. 
 
 14 
The analysis of IM author writeprints in this research provides a foundation for 
using behavioral biometrics as a cyber forensics element of criminal investigations.  The 
principal contributions of this dissertation are: 
1. A process for creating and analyzing IM behavioral biometrics-based writeprints 
to assist with cybercrime investigations. 
2. An IM-specific stylometric taxonomy for IM writeprints and authorship analysis. 
3. A forensically feasible ground-truth dataset. 
IM writeprints can be used in conjunction with other evidence, investigation 
techniques, and biometrics techniques to reduce the potential suspect space to a certain 
subset of suspects; identify the most plausible author of an IM conversation from a group 
of suspects; link related crimes; develop an interview and interrogation strategy; and 
gather convincing digital evidence to justify search and seizure and provide probable 
cause.

2.  RELATED WORK AND TECHNOLOGIES 
 
 
 
Historically, authorship analysis has been extensively applied to literature and 
published articles.  More recently, the research community has begun to use behavioral 
biometrics-based authorship analysis techniques for CMC with recent application to e-
mail, chat, and online forums.  A large research gap exists in applying authorship analysis 
techniques to instant messaging communications to facilitate learning the author identity 
or author characteristics in support of cybercrime investigations.  Preliminary journal 
articles and conference presentations [Ore2006b, OA2009a, OA2009b, OA2010b] from 
this research are the only comprehensive examination of IM authorship analysis.  
Gaussian distributions have been applied in various biometric and forensic research 
efforts including facial recognition and tracking, voice recognition, signature verification, 
and characterizing social media authors.  However, no research to date has used Gaussian 
distributions to perform IM authorship analysis. 
This chapter provides a brief history of authorship analysis and an overview of 
several related works for CMC authorship analysis studies.  It provides an overview of 
several related works for biometric-related Gaussian studies.  This chapter also provides 
an overview of the criminal investigation process and the use of IM authorship analysis 
as input to the cybercrime investigation process and cyberprofiles.

2.1  Authorship Analysis 
Authorship analysis is based on a linguistic research area called stylometric 
analysis and is sometimes referred to as authorship attribution [BVT1996, Hol1994, 
Rud1998].  Authorship analysis has been extensively applied to literature and published 
articles.  Some of the earliest research dates back to the fourth century BC, when 
librarians in the library of Alexandria studied the authentication of texts attributed to 
Homer [Lov2002].  Other early known research dates back to the 18th century when 
English logician Augustus de Morgan theorized that authorship can be determined by the 
size of the words in the text [DeM1882].  Mendenhall [Men1887] analyzed and applied 
Morgan’s research to publish results of authorship analysis among Bacon, Marlowe, and 
Shakespeare.  More recent literary studies of authorship analysis include the disputed 
Federalist Papers [BS1998, MW1964, HF1995, TSH1996, LA2006] and Shakespeare’s 
works [EV1991, MM1994, HAC2006].  Mosteller and Wallace [MW1964] conducted a 
thorough study of the authorship of the Federalist Papers and published results that 
attributed all 12 disputed papers to Madison.  Historical scholars have generally accepted 
their conclusion, making it a milestone in this field [ZLCH2006].  More recent studies 
include research by Don Foster on the author of the Unabomber Manifesto [Fos2000], 
which helped convict Ted Kaczynski.  Recent research has introduced authorship analysis 
to computer-mediated communications with promising results [DACM2001b, 
Ore2006b]. 
Authorship analysis can be divided into the following categories [ZLCH2006]: 
 
 18 
• Authorship identification.  Attempts to determine the author of a piece of 
text by examining other text samples that have been authenticated as having 
been produced by that author [Cha2005]. 
• Authorship characterization.  Categorizes an author’s text according to 
sociolinguistic attributes such as gender, age, educational background, 
income, linguistic background, nationality, profession, psychological status, 
and ethnicity.  These attributes are aimed at inferring an author’s background 
characteristics rather than identity.  Some attributes previously researched are 
gender [KAS2002], [DACM2002a], [KCAC2006], language background 
[DACM2002b], and education level [JB2005]. 
• Similarity detection.  Compares multiple sample texts and determines 
whether they were produced by a single author without actually identifying 
the author [ZLCH2006].  Aimed at discovering variations in the writing style 
of an author [PC2004] or to find the resemblances between the writings of 
different authors, mostly for the purpose of detecting plagiarism [GHM2005].  
Plagiarism involves the complete or partial replication of a piece of work 
without properly acknowledging the original source [Clo2000]. 
Authorship analysis uses a variety of writing style features that can be derived 
from a particular piece of work to facilitate authorship identification or characterization.  
The identification and learning of these features with a sufficiently high accuracy is the 
principal focus and challenge of authorship analysis [DACM2002b].  Previous research 
studies have used a variety of features such as n-grams and spelling and grammatical 
 
 19 
error frequency, however the following four feature categories have evolved for 
computer-mediated communication [AC2006, DACM2001a, ZLCH2006]: 
• Lexical.  Features such as the total number of words, number of words per 
sentence, word length distribution, vocabulary richness, average characters 
per sentence, average characters per word, and character usage frequency 
[AC2006]. 
• Syntactic.  Features that involve patterns used for the formation of sentences, 
including punctuation and function words [AC2006]. 
• Structural.  Features that involve the organization and layout of text 
including the use of greetings and signatures and the number of paragraphs 
and average paragraph length [AC2006]. 
• Content specific.  Features that include key words that are used within a 
specific topic area [AC2006].  For example, a criminal selling illegal 
merchandise will use certain terms related to the items. 
Researchers have begun to use authorship analysis to CMC, with application to e-
mail, online forums (i.e. discussion groups or newsgroups), and online chat. 
2.2  Research in Authorship Analysis of Computer-Mediated Communications 
 Olivier De Vel published several papers on authorship identification and 
characterization.  The paper Mining E-mail Content for Author Identification Forensics 
[DACM2001b], published with A. Anderson, M. Corney, and G. Mohay studied the 
effects of multiple e-mail topics on authorship identification performance.

 The experiments used 156 e-mail documents written by three authors.  Each author 
contributed e-mails on each of three topics: movies, food, and travel.  The experiments 
used a total of 191 features and the support vector machine (SVM) classification 
algorithm.  SVM is a supervised learning model that constructs a hyperplane or set of 
hyperplanes to perform data classification.  The hyperplanes separate sets of objects 
having different class memberships.  With classification accuracy between 77.6%-91.6%, 
the results indicated the ability of the SVM to discriminate between authors without 
consideration of the conversation topic.  Another experiment separated all e-mails into 
their individual topic categories.  The SVM classifier was trained on the movie e-mail 
topic document set and tested on the remaining food and travel document sets.  With 
performance accuracy up to 100%, the results indicated that the SVM classifier is able to 
effectively discriminate between the authors even when multiple topic categories are 
used.  Overall, the experiments provided encouraging results for both aggregated and 
multiple topic author identification.  This research benefited from a large feature set, 
however it is limited by a small dataset with few authors and emails. 
 Olivier de Vel, Anderson, Corney, and Mohay also published the paper Gender-
Preferential Text Mining of E-mail Discourse [DACM2002a] that explores authorship 
categorization for gender identification.  The research uses gender-preferential language 
features to determine the gender of the author of e-mail messages.  Previous research has 
demonstrated that women’s language tends to use more “emotionally intensive adverbs 
and adjectives, such as “so”, “terribly”, “awfully”, “dreadful”, and “quite”, and that their 
language is more punctuated with attenuated assertions, apologies, questions, personal 
 
 21 
orientation, and support” [DACM2002a]. 
 The experiment data consisted of 4369 e-mails from 325 authors from a large 
academic organization.  The experiments used a features set of 222 attributes.  Baseline 
features consist of common character and word based attributes and structural features 
used in previous e-mail authorship identification research.  The gender-specific attributes 
attempt to measure the frequency of use of adjectives, adverbs, and apologies.  The 
results of the experiments indicate that the SVM classifier is able to discriminate between 
author genders with a maximum accuracy of 71.1% [DACM2002a].  This research 
benefited from an extended feature set and a dataset with a large number of authors and 
emails.  It provided a foundation for future CMC author characterization research. 
 The paper A Framework for Authorship Identification of Online Messages: Writing-
Style Features and Classification Techniques by  Rong Zheng, Yi Qin, Zan Huang, 
Hsinchun Chen [ZLCH2006] presented a comparison of techniques for author 
identification by using several classification algorithms to analyze features.  The authors 
leveraged existing feature sets from [DACM2001a], which they customized to include 
particular traits that are suitable to the datasets used for the experiments.  The feature set 
was divided into lexical, syntactic, structural, and content-specific categories. 
 The experiments used English and Chinese newsgroup posting datasets.  The 
English dataset consisted of messages from 20 authors (30-92 messages each) from 
misc.forsale.computers (including 27 subgroups) in Google newsgroups.  The Chinese 
dataset consisted of Bulletin Board System (BBS) messages from 20 authors (30-40 
messages each) from bbs.mit.edu and smth.org.  The best accuracy was achieved with 
 
 22 
SVM and all features.  The experiments achieved accuracies of 90%-97% for the English 
dataset and accuracies of 72%-88% for the Chinese dataset.  The experiments also 
studied the effects of the number of authors and number of messages used in the 
classification and analysis.  The results showed that the accuracy of classification 
increases as the number of authors decreases or the number of messages per author 
increases.  This paper provided many foundational principals for the IM feature set 
created for this research. 
 The paper Writeprints: A Stylometric Approach to Identity-Level Identification and 
Similarity Detection in Cyberspace by Ahmed Abbasi and Hsinchun Chen [AC2008] 
introduced a writeprints technique for identification and similarity detection.  Abbasi’s 
writeprints is a “Karhunen-Loeve-transforms-based technique that uses a sliding window 
and pattern disruption to capture feature usage variance at a finer level of granularity” 
[AC2008]. 
 The experiments used e-mail, instant messaging, feedback comments, and program 
code for datasets.  The e-mail dataset consists of e-mail messages from the publicly 
available Enron e-mail corpus.  The instant messaging dataset consists of IM logs from 
U.S. CyberWatch.  The feedback comments dataset consists of buyer/seller feedback 
comments from eBay.  The program code dataset consists of programming code snippets 
from the Sun Java Technology Forum (forum.java.sun.com).  The experiments randomly 
extract 100 authors from each dataset.  The feature sets consists of a baseline feature set 
(BF) and an extended feature set (EF).  The BF contains 327 lexical, syntactic, structural, 
and content-specific features.  The EF contains the BF features as well as several n-gram 
 
 23 
feature categories and a list of 5513 common word misspellings. 
 For identification, the writeprints method is compared against the SVM and 
Ensemble SVM classifiers.  For similarity detection, the writeprints method is compared 
against the principal component analysis (PCA) and Karhunen-Loeve (K-L) transforms.  
PCA is an unsupervised technique that captures variance across a large number of 
features in a reduced dimensionality.  Karhunen-Loeve is a “supervised form of PCA that 
allows inclusion of class information in the transformation process” [AC2008].  The 
writeprint identification accuracy results for each dataset are: e-mail 83.1%-92%, IM 
31.7%-50.4%, feedback comments 91.3%-96%, and program code 52.7%-88.8%.  All 
techniques performed better on using the extended feature set.  For similarity detection, 
the writeprints technique had the best performance on all datasets.  Once again, the 
extended feature set had better overall performance than the baseline feature set.  This 
research benefits from using a new writeprints technique, expanded feature sets, diverse 
datasets, and a large number of authors.  Although the accuracy results are satisfactory 
for e-mail and feedback comments, they are very low for instant messages, indicating 
more research and experiments are needed in this area.  This paper provided valuable 
insight into authorship analysis for a variety of CMC and provided many foundational 
principals for the IM feature set created for this research. 
 The paper Writeprints: Conversationally-inspired Stylometric Features for 
Authorship Attribution in Instant Messaging by Marco Cristani, Girogio Rofflo, Cristina 
Segalin, Loris Bazzani, Alessandro Vinciarelli, and Vittorio Murino [CRSBVM2012] 
introduced a new method of analyzing IM authorship called “turn-taking”.  Turn taking 
 
 24 
focuses on analyzing the text (or set of messages) written by one participant during an 
interval of time in which none of the other participants writes anything.  The authors used 
IM data captures via the Skype application for 77 authors with an average of 615 words 
per author.  The paper analyzes conversation turns using 16 features.  These features are 
mostly counts and don’t consider specific features such as abbreviations or type of 
emoticon used.  This paper cited [OA2009b] as a reference on the use of a stylometric 
feature set specifically developed for IM.  IM conversations only partially mimic real life 
spoken conversations where one speaker listens and the other one talks.  IM is more 
representative of a conversation where both people are speaking at the same time, 
constantly interrupting each other, and frequently jumping between simultaneous topics.  
The paper also measures writing speed, which can only be calculated on the authors 
computer or device and is not feasible for cybercrime investigations.  While this paper 
introduces an interesting concept, the idea of turn-taking in IM is very questionable given 
the type of conversation interchange over IM. 
 The paper A Unified Data Mining Solution for Authorship Analysis in Anonymous 
Textual Communications by Farkhund Iqbal, Hamad Binsalleeh, Benjamin C.M. Fung, 
and Mourad Debbabi, [IBFD2013] models writeprints based on a combination of features 
frequently found in a suspect’s messages.  The experiments used 302 stylometric 
features, including lexical, syntactic, structural, domain specific, and gender preferential 
features.  An anonymous message writeprint is compared with the writeprint of every 
suspect to identify the suspect that is most similar to the anonymous message writeprint.  
The experiments used the Enron email dataset for authorship identification and online 
 
 25 
blogs for authorship characterization.  The author identification accuracy was 69.75% 
using 20 email authors.  The paper performs authorship characterization using gender and 
location sociolinguistic categories.  However, the training data is extracted from an online 
source (blogger.com) that may not be representative of ground-truth data.  This online 
data is not validated and false information may have been included in the training data.  
The author characterization accuracy was 60% for gender and 39.13% for location using 
20 authors. 
2.3  Research Using Gaussian Distributions 
Gaussian distributions have been applied in various biometric and forensic research 
efforts including facial recognition and tracking [RMG1998, Man2012], voice 
recognition [RQD2000], [MD2001], signature verification [RD2003], and characterizing 
social media authors [PC2011]. 
The paper Tracking and Segmenting People in Varying Lighting Conditions using 
Colour by Yogesh Raja, Stephen J. McKenna, and Shaogang Gong [RMG1998] applies 
Gaussian models to detect and track people on video.  The authors use color hues to 
detect, track, and segment people, faces, and hands in dynamic scenes.  They use 
Gausssian models to estimate probability densities of skin color, clothing, and 
background.  The experiments are performed on two use cases: 1) actor segmentation for 
virtual studios, and 2) focus of attention for face and gesture recognition systems.  The 
experiments collect a number of Gaussian functions that are an approximation to a multi-
modal distribution in color space and probabilities are computed for various color pixels.  
The color mixture models are then used to track and segment the colors of people’s skin, 
 
 26 
clothing, and background.  The result is a statistical distribution of colors of a person in 
an image plane.  This paper is an example of applying Gaussian models in a biometrics 
scenario.  The paper provides a framework and models for performing these experiments, 
but it did not provide quantifiable results data. 
The paper Gaussian Mixture Models for On-line Signature Verification by Jonas 
Richiardi and Andrzej Drygajlo [RD2003] applies Gaussian models for online signature 
verification.  A handwritten signature is a commonly used behavioral biometric.  The 
research uses spatial and temporal signature features to create Gaussian Mixture Models 
(GMM).  The signatures “are sampled at 100 Hz using a Wacom Intuos A6 tablet on 
which a paper alignment grid is placed, and each sample point (raw data vector) consists 
of values for the horizontal (x) position, vertical (y) position, pressure (p), azimuth, and 
elevation of the signing pen.” [RD2003]  The experiments include a 50-user subset of the 
Ministerio de Ciencia y Tecnologı´a (MCYT) multimodal database.  The data consists of 
25 authentic signatures and 25 skilled forgeries for each user.  “The performance of the 
proposed GMM-based signature verification system was tested by scoring each user 
model against 20 authentic signatures and 25 skilled forgeries (from 5 different forgers), 
making a total test set of 1000 authentic signatures and 1250 forgeries” [RD2003].  The 
experiments resulted in a 3.5% error rate using 64 Gaussian components.  This paper 
shows that GMM is an effective method for online signature verification as a behavioral 
biometric. 
The paper Identifying Topical Authorities in Microblogs by Aditya Pal and Scott 
Counts [PC2011] applies Gaussian models to distinguish microblogging authors of high 
 
 27 
topical value.  The research proposes a set of features for characterizing social media 
authors and performs probabilistic clustering over this feature space to produce a ranked 
list of top authors for a given topic for identifying topical authorities in microblogging 
environments.  The authors use Gaussian models to cluster authors over their feature 
space.  The research uses data collected from the public social networking site Twitter 
over five days between June 6, 2010 and June 10, 2010.  Tweets are extracted from this 
dataset across three topics: oil spill, world cup, and iPhone using simple substring 
matching.  The research categorizes tweets into three categories: original tweet (OT), 
conversational tweet (CT), and repeated tweet (RT) across 17 total features.  The 
resulting dataset included 539,524 users and 1,563,320 tweets.  The authors used 
Gaussian models to generate a list of the top 10 authors for each topic.  To evaluate their 
approach, the authors conducted a user study where participants were shown 40 screens, 
each with a different author.  Each screen asked participants to evaluate the author on 
“how interesting and authoritative they found the author and her tweets” using a 7-point 
Likert scales.  A Likert scale is used to assign a numerical value to qualitative data.  In 
this research a scale of 1-7 was used, with 7 being the highest for each question.  The 
results of the user study showed that the Gaussian model technique yielded results that 
correlated highly with the end user’s ratings.  This research was effective at 
implementing a set of features and applying the Gaussian models to identify interesting 
and authoritative authors across various topic areas as validated by user opinion.

2.4  Criminal Investigation and Cybercrime 
Many disciplines including psychology, philosophy, sociology, criminology, law, 
knowledge management, and computer science have studied the criminal investigation 
process.  Although cybercrime is a relatively new form of crime that has rapidly evolved 
over the last few decades, cybercrime investigations and traditional criminal 
investigations share the same goal – to gather information.  Figure 2-1 illustrates the 
traditional criminal investigation process as presented in Scene of the Cybercrime 
[Cro2008]. 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2-1.  Criminal Investigation Process 
 
 
 
 
 29 
 The investigator first determines if an act has violated the law and warrants an 
investigation.  Next, evidence is collected and analyzed, including tangible evidence such 
as hard drives and electronic devices, and the digital evidence they contain.  Cybercrime 
investigations for IM rely on instant messaging exchanges, or conversations, as digital 
evidence.  The sources for IM digital evidence include both data and meta-data.  The data 
includes the IM text and the meta-data includes other related evidence such as the IM 
client version, timestamps, the length of time the user has been logged on, etc.  The next 
step involves seeking expert advice if necessary.  Often times in cybercrime cases the 
investigator needs to seek expert advice on the technical aspects of the crime.  Experts 
may be on staff, or may be located from professional organizations, consultants, or the 
academic community.  For IM related cybercrimes experts may include computer 
scientists, network engineers, linguists, communication experts, or social psychologists.  
Expert analysis of IM writeprints may determine probable cause and justify search and 
seizure of additional evidence.  Experts may also use IM writeprints to build a criminal 
profile to focus the investigation.  The next step of interviewing witnesses and 
interrogating suspects is an ongoing process throughout the investigation as new 
witnesses and suspects are discovered.  IM writeprint analysis may be used to shape the 
interview and interrogation strategy.  For example, if the suspect’s writeprint is highly 
similar to writeprints in other cases, this information could be used in an attempt to link 
related crimes and to question the suspect on his or her relationship with the other 
victims.  Throughout this stage suspects are eliminated and the most plausible suspect is 
identified.  Next, the investigator begins preparing the case file to include the initial 
 
 30 
incident report and evidence.  Evidence might include other reports such as lab reports, 
written statements, and other relevant information.  Once the case file is constructed it is 
analyzed to determine weaknesses and to identify additional information needed for 
prosecution.  This analysis leads to any follow-up investigations that need to occur 
including collecting additional evidence and interviewing witnesses again.  Once the case 
is considered complete the prosecutor will decide whether to bring the case to trial and 
how to proceed.   
Expert witnesses may use IM writeprint analysis and criminal profiles as part of 
their presentation in a trial.  There is no standard accuracy measure threshold for 
authorship attribution evidence; the investigator only needs probable cause to initiate a 
warrant or arrest.  Authorship analysis identification results greater than 70% are 
acceptable during an investigation process [IBFD2013].  Evidence admissibility varies by 
jurisdiction and one of the biggest hurdles is establishing authenticity of the messages 
[HZ2012].  State and Federal courts have been applying Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) 
901, Authenticating or Identifying Evidence and its state rule equivalents to text and 
instant messages [HZ2012].  The frequently used FRE 901 rules to authenticate digital 
evidence include: 
FRE901 b(3) Comparison by an Expert Witness or the Trier of Fact. A 
comparison with an authenticated specimen by an expert witness or the trier of 
fact. 
 
 31 
FRE901 b(4) Distinctive Characteristics and the Like. The appearance, contents, 
substance, internal patterns, or other distinctive characteristics of the item, taken 
together with all the circumstances. 
FRE901 b(4) has been used most frequently to submit text and IM messages as 
circumstantial evidence, for example People v. Pierre, New York, 2007.  The case of 
People v. Agudelo, New York, 2012 set the precedent, which allows authentication of 
text messages based on testimony from either the sender or recipient of the message as 
admissible evidence.  Validation studies provide the kind of information required for an 
evidence admissibility hearing.  Some relevant cases were investigated and prosecuted 
based on text message abbreviations, sentence length, and punctuation [Lea2009].  
[Cha2013]’s authorship analysis methods on a computer diary (Green v. Dalton, DC, 
2001) and email (Zarolia v. Osborne/Buffalo Environmental Corp, MD, 1998) have been 
admitted as evidence into several trials along with expert testimony to state a conclusion 
about authorship.  In another [Cha2005] case the plaintiff withdrew his suit against the 
government after the questioned emails were identified as his own writing based on the 
syntactic patterns. “Even with partial admissibility, it may still be possible for an expert 
to take the stand, outline a set of features, and demonstrate informally that the 
defendant’s use is more inline with the document under discussion than other candidates, 
while leaving the jury to draw the necessary conclusion that the document was written by 
the defendant” [Juo2006].  It is important to ensure that analysis methods are easy to 
understand to enable an investigator or an expert witness to present the writeprint and 
explain the finding in a court of law [IBFD2013].  Easy to understand graphs allow 
 
 32 
information to be communicated to investigators, attorneys, judges, and jury members in 
a simple and clear way [Cha2005]. 
IM, email, and text messages have been use as part of the investigation and 
submitted as evidence in trials (State v. Lott, NH, 2005).  Authorship analysis of email 
and computer-based digital text have been used in testimony in several trials [Cha2013].  
There is a gap in using IM authorship analysis to support the investigation and 
eventually, trial.  IM writeprints may be used to generate investigative leads, create 
leverage in negotiating a settlement, or to present admissible evidence in a trial.  This 
dissertation provides the foundation for using IM writeprints during the investigation 
activities. 
2.5  Criminal Profiling 
Criminal profiling is an investigative method that has been used in traditional 
investigations that can also be applied to cybercrime investigations, known as 
cyberprofiling.  Cross defines traditional criminal profiling is the “art and science of 
developing a description of a criminal’s characteristics (physical, intellectual, and 
emotional) based on information collected at the scene of the crime” [Cro2008].  
Criminal profiling often uses patterns and correlations among criminal activity and 
different crimes to construct a profile.  Criminal profiling is used to assist with the 
investigative process, reduce the potential suspect space to a certain subset of suspects, 
link related crimes, and develop an interview and interrogation strategy [Cas1999].  It is 
important to note that a criminal profile will only provide generalities about the type of 
person who committed a crime, it will not identify a specific individual.  Criminal 
 
 33 
profiling is one method among many for assisting with investigations and building a case 
file.  The profile cannot exist as evidence, rather it provides information to allow 
investigators to focus on the right suspects and begin to gather additional evidence 
[Cro2008].  A criminal profile can be used in court in conjunction with expert witness 
testimony.  “An expert witness can reference a criminal profile as the basis of an opinion 
that there is a high probability of a link between a particular suspect and a particular 
crime” [Cro2008].  An IM author writeprint may be used as input to a criminal profile. 
Criminal profiling can be traced to the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th 
centuries and was later used to investigate the high profile Jack the Ripper killings as 
well as preparing an interrogation strategy of Adolf Hitler during World War II 
[Rog2003].  The FBI is credited with formalizing the criminal profiling process.  The 
FBI’s Behavioral Science Unit (BSU) “focuses on developing new and innovative 
investigative approaches and techniques to solve crimes by studying offenders and their 
behaviors and motivations” [FBI2013].  The BSU has been assisting local, state, and 
federal agencies in narrowing investigations by providing criminal profiles since the 
1970s [DRBH1986].  The FBI BSU has created the six-step criminal profile generating 
process shown in Table 2-1. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 34 
 
 
Table 2-1.  FBI BSU Criminal Profile Process 
FBI BSU Criminal Profile Process 
1. Profiling Inputs The first step collects profiling inputs including 
comprehensive information about the crime and all 
evidence collected, both tangible, physical evidence and 
digital evidence. 
2. Decision Process Models This step analyzes the information and evidence to 
determine patterns and possible linkages to other crimes. 
3. Crime Assessment The crime scene is reconstructed and analyzed to 
determine the sequence of events and other information 
about the crime. 
4. Criminal Profile The first three steps are combined to create a criminal 
profile, often incorporating the motives, physical qualities, 
and personality of the perpetrator.  The criminal profile is 
also used to create an interrogation strategy for the 
suspects. 
5. The Investigation Investigators and others use the profile to learn more 
information and identify suspects.  Suspects matching the 
profile are evaluated.  The profile may be reassessed if no 
leads or suspects are identified. 
6. The Apprehension The last stage occurs when investigators believe they have 
identified the most plausible suspect likely to be the 
perpetrator.  A warrant is obtained for the arrest of the 
individual, usually followed by a trial [DRBH1986]. 
 
 
 
The FBI criminal profile generating process may be easily applied in a cybercrime 
investigation to perform cyberprofiling.  Various types of digital and non-digital evidence 
may be combined as profile inputs, including, email, IM conversations, network packet 
captures, account activity information, and physical evidence.  Data and author 
behavioral biometrics are analyzed for patterns using statistical methods.  For example, 
IM conversations may be analyzed for patterns to create an IM author’s writeprint.  A 
cybercriminal’s profile may include a number of traits such as time and location of 
 
 35 
computer access, types of computer attacks launched by the attacker, programs and attack 
tools used, writeprints, and targets of the cybercrime whether they be human or electronic 
(networks, satellites, phones, computer systems, etc.). 
In the context of IM-assisted cybercrime, cyberprofiling uses IM data such as the 
conversation logs, IM client version, timestamps, the length of time the user has been 
logged on, etc.  This dissertation focuses on the linguistic aspects of the IM conversation 
to create IM author writeprints that may be used as an input to a criminal cyberprofile and 
as an element in a multimodal biometrics systems to assist with cybercrime decision 
support.  Writeprints may be used in conjunction with other evidence and investigative 
techniques to build or validate a criminal profile; reduce the potential suspect space to a 
certain subset of suspects; link related crimes; develop an interview and interrogation 
strategy; and gather convincing digital evidence to justify search and seizure and provide 
probable cause.  This dissertation uses authorship analysis and statistical techniques to 
create and analyze IM writeprints to assist in identifying an author, as well as certain 
characteristics of the author of a set of IM messages.

3.  RESEARCH METHODOLOGY 
 
 
 
This chapter presents detailed explanations of the methods, tools, and techniques to 
create and analyze behavioral biometrics-based instant messaging writeprints to assist in 
identifying online cyber criminals and collecting digital evidence as part of the criminal 
investigation.  It provides a detailed description of the problem and the goals this research 
seeks to achieve.  It explains the research process and the IM-specific stylometric feature 
set taxonomy.  This chapter also provides a detailed description of the two datasets used 
in the research, including methods of collection, dataset size, and author demographics.  
Lastly, this chapter provides an overview of the statistical software and other tools used 
to analyze the data.  The research methodology uses: 
• An IM-specific stylometric feature set, 
• Two real-world datasets, 
• Preprocessing software to extract the stylometric features into a writeprint, 
• Statistical software to process models, and 
• Graphical software to visualize results. 
3.1  Problem Definition 
The explosive growth in the use of instant messaging communication in both 
personal and professional environments has resulted in an increased risk to proprietary, 
sensitive, and personal information and safety due to the influx of IM-assisted 
 
 37 
cybercrimes, such as phishing, social engineering, threatening, cyber bullying, hate 
speech and crimes, child exploitation, sexual harassment, and illegal sales and 
distribution of software.  Instant messaging’s anonymity and use of virtual identities 
hinders social accountability and presents a critical challenge for cybercrime 
investigation.  Criminals use virtual identities to hide their true identity by using multiple 
screen names, impersonating other users, or supplying false information on their virtual 
identities with the intention of deceiving unsuspecting victims and committing various 
cybercrimes.  Although central IM servers authenticate users upon login, there is no 
means of authenticating or validating peers (buddies).  Current IM products are not 
addressing the anonymity and ease of impersonation over instant messaging.  Cyber 
forensic techniques are needed to assist cybercrime decision support tools in collecting 
and analyzing digital evidence, discovering characteristics about the cyber criminal, and 
assisting in identifying cyber criminal suspects. 
This research creates and analyzes behavioral biometrics-based instant messaging 
writeprints as cyber forensics input for cybercrime investigations.  It uses authorship 
analysis techniques to create a set of stylometric features robust enough to show 
separation between authors and between author categories.  The real time, casual nature 
of instant messaging communications offers several interesting stylometric features such 
as message structure, unusual language usage, and special stylistic markers that are useful 
in forming a suitable writeprint feature set for authorship analysis.  Authorship 
identification can be applied to IM to assist in identifying criminals who hide their true 
identity or impersonate a known individual.  Authorship characterization can be used to 
 
 38 
help discover IM cyber criminals who supply false information in their virtual identities, 
such as gender. 
3.2  Research Process 
The research process extracts stylometric features from IM messages to create 
author writeprints and uses statistical methods to analyze and evaluate the writeprints.  
This research evaluates the effectiveness of the writeprints using different parameters 
such as the number of messages used as input.  These parameters are systematically 
modified in an iterative process to evaluate their impact on the results.  The goal of this 
research is to create and validate IM author writeprints that provide cybercrime 
investigators a unique tool for investigating IM-assisted cybercrimes.  Writeprints may be 
used as input to a criminal cyberprofile and as an element of a multimodal system for 
cybercrime investigations.  Writeprints can be used in conjunction with other evidence, 
criminal investigation techniques, and biometrics techniques to reduce the potential 
suspect space to a certain subset of suspects; identify the most plausible author of an IM 
conversation from a group of suspects; link related crimes; develop an interview and 
interrogation strategy; and gather convincing digital evidence to justify search and 
seizure and provide probable cause.  At a high level this research performs the following: 
1. Develops a stylometric feature set, 
2. Pre-processes the data, 
3. Creates writeprints, and 
4. Analyzes and evaluates writeprints with statistical methods. 
 
 39 
The detailed research process is illustrated in Figure 3-1.

3.2.1  Stylometric Feature Set Taxonomy 
Stylometric features are characteristics that can be derived from instant messages to 
facilitate authorship analysis [AC2006].  A stylometric feature set is composed of a 
predefined set of measurable writing style attributes.  Given t predefined features, each 
set of IM messages for a given author can be represented as a t-dimensional vector, called 
a writeprint.  Feature sets may significantly affect the performance of authorship analysis, 
both positively and negatively.  Previous studies have created feature sets for computer-
 
 40 
mediated communications such as e-mail, forums, and online chat [DACM2001b, 
KCAC2008, ZLCH2006].  Previous studies have also created feature sets for specific 
content-related purposes, such as illegal sales and distribution of software, to facilitate 
cybercrime investigations.  Other stylometric features sets are not comprehensive enough 
to capture the stylistic features that are frequently found in IM communications. 
[DMCT2011] and [CRSBVM2012] contain small feature sets (37 and 16 respectively) of 
category totals.  For example, other research considers total emoticons used in a message, 
while this research considers counts for specific varieties of emoticons used in a message.  
This research provides a comprehensive stylometric feature set taxonomy of instant 
messaging writing style characteristics to create IM writeprints to assist with cyber 
forensics and cybercrime investigations. 
Numerous types of features have been used in previous studies including n-grams 
and vocabulary richness [BVT1996, AC2008, ZLCH2006], however four categories used 
extensively for computer-mediated communications are lexical, syntactic, structural, and 
content-specific features [LZC2006, AC2006, ZLCH2006].  The feature set created for 
IM writeprints in this research is a 356-dimensional vector including lexical, syntactic, 
and structural features, shown in Figure 3-2.  The number of features in each category is 
shown in parenthesis.  Content specific features are highly dependent on the topic of the 
messages; therefore the feature set taxonomy does not include content specific features in 
order to achieve generic authorship identification and characterization across various 
applications.  With instant messaging authorship analysis, a feature set that is 
 
 41 
independent of the message topic focuses on the authors’ stylistic preferences instead of 
the specific vocabulary [KCAC2008]. 
 
 
 
 
Figure 3-2.  Instant Messaging Stylometric Feature Set Taxonomy 
 
 
 
Instant messaging communications have several characteristics that are useful in forming 
a comprehensive feature set, which may help reveal the writing style of the author.  The 
IM feature set taxonomy created for this research includes several stylistic features that 
distinguish it from related studies [DMCT2011] and [CRSBVM2012], such as 
abbreviations and emoticons, which are frequently found in instant messaging 
communications. 
 
 
 42 
Table 3-1 shows a detailed breakdown, with examples where applicable, of the IM 
feature set.  Lexical features mainly consist of count totals and are further broken down 
into emoticons, abbreviations, word-based, and character-based features.  Syntactic 
features include punctuation and function words in order to capture an author’s habits of 
organizing sentences.  Function words include conjunctions, prepositions, and other 
words that carry little meaning when used alone, such as “the” or “of”.  They provide 
relationships to content words in the sentence, such as “ball” or “bounce”.  Analyzing 
function words as opposed to content words allows topic-independent results.  Structural 
features capture the way an author organizes the layout of text.  With IM communications 
there are no standard headers, greetings, farewells, or signatures, leaving simply the 
average characters and words per message in terms of structural layout. 
The feature set taxonomy created for this research is tailored for IM authorship 
analysis.  The goal of the IM feature set taxonomy is to develop a set of features that 
show separation of author writeprints.  Each stylometric feature in the taxonomy was 
selected for its relevance to IM communications to create a feature set robust enough to 
show separation between various authors and between author categories.

3.2.2  Data Pre-Processing 
Instant messaging data pre-processing involves several steps to prepare raw IM 
data for writeprint creation.  The IM messages are logged to American Standard Code for 
Information Interchange (ASCII) text files in the following format: 
[timestamp] [user name:] [message] 
Figure 3-3 shows an example excerpt from an IM conversation log. 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 3-3.  Raw IM Conversation Log 
 
 
 
The instant messages are parsed to extract the data for each author and to remove metadata and 
noise, such as timestamps, usernames, and automatic away message responses.  Thus,  
 
Figure 3-4 shows a formatted log for User 1.

hey, what time is the meeting today? 
yeah, I will be there, it sounds very interesting! :) :)

3.2.3  Writeprint Creation 
Writeprint creation uses a Perl program to process formatted logs and create writeprints.  First, the 
writeprint extractor module splits the logs into a configurable conversation size.  A conversation is a 
set of messages {M1,…,Mp}, for example 50 messages per conversation.  A message consists of the text 
delineated by the newline or end-of-line (EOL) character.  For example,  
 
Figure 3-4 contains only two messages.  Many other CMC stylometric related 
works focus on message level analysis [AC2008, ZLCH2006].  [CRSBVM2012] focuses 
on “turn-taking”, which is very dynamic and often influenced by the other party in the 
message exchange.  This research analyzes conversations of various sizes to determine 
the necessary number of messages to separate authors. 
Next, the program inputs conversations and defined stylometric features to the 
count module to create totals for each stylometric feature, resulting in the output of a 
writeprint (Wx) for each set of messages {M1,…,Mp} of each supplied author (An) or 
author category (Cm).  A writeprint is a t-dimensional vector, where t represents the total 
number of features.  This research uses a 356-dimensional vector.  Each writeprint is 
assigned a class, which is the author (An) or sociolinguistic category (Cm) of the 
writeprint (Wx).  Table 3-2 shows the writeprint class descriptions and labels used in this 
research.  The program outputs a writeprint in comma-separated value (CSV) format.  
Each value in the writeprint represents a count or ratio for a specific feature.  The features 
in the vector do not need to be in a specific order for this research since each feature is 
assigned a label identifying it.  An example writeprint for an author W(An) using a 
selected feature set {F1,…,Fq}, where q=100,  for a set of messages {M1,…,Mp} looks 
like the following: 
 
 46 
105,1,0,0,4,0,1250,0,4,0,18,8,1,2,0,0,0,0,1,9,0,14,31,6.78,3.71,23,

3.2.4  Writeprint Analysis 
Writeprints must be normalized and standardized prior to input into statistical 
models.  Writeprints consist of count totals that range in values from small to large across 
the 356-dimensional vector.  Features with large values can often dominate the results of 
statistical models.  For example, features that have large values may influence distance-
based algorithms, such as Euclidean distances.  Normalization and standardization 
ensures that features with a wide range of values are less likely to outweigh features with 
smaller ranges.  It allows data on different scales to be compared by bringing them to a 
common scale, thus allowing the underlying characteristics of the data sets to be 
compared.  The IM writeprint data is normalized and standardized using the following 
steps: 
1. Normalization:  The range of values in a writeprint is normalized to be 
between 0.0 and 1.0.  Normalization is performed using the formula 
 
,
 (3-1) 
 
where each feature value in the writeprint is divided by the sum of all 
feature values in the writeprint.  Xi is the value of the i-th feature in the 
writeprint vector.  Xi prime is the new value of the i-th feature in the 
writeprint vector. k is the total number of features in the writeprint vector. 
In this research k = 356. 
 
 48 
2. Standardization:  The range of values for each feature across all 
writeprints in a population is standardized to measure the number of 
standard deviations the feature value is from its mean.  This is known as a 
standard score or Z-score.  Standardization converts all feature values to a 
common scale with an average of zero and a standard deviation of 1 using 
the formula 
 
. 
(3-2) 
 
The mean and standard deviation is calculated across all values of each 
feature in the dataset population.  Xi is the value of the i-th feature in the 
writeprint vector.  Xi double prime is the new value of the i-th feature in the 
writeprint vector.  For each feature value, subtract the mean of the set of 
features (µ) in the population and divide by the standard deviation of the set 
of features (σ) in the population. 
After the writeprints are normalized and standardized, statistical models (described 
in section 3.3) are created and used to visualize and analyze the data. 
3.3  Statistical Methods and Software 
When providing authorship analysis support to a criminal investigation it is 
important to use easy to understand methods that an investigator or expert witness can 
present and explain in the court of law [IBFD2013].  For example, SVM is a popular 
choice in many CMC authorship analysis related works [DACM2001b, ZLCH2006, 
 
 49 
AC2008], however its methods are often difficult to interpret to demonstrate the reason 
for reaching a conclusion.  Therefore methods such as SVM are not suitable for evidence 
collection and presentation, which are important steps in a criminal investigation 
[IBFD2013].  This research uses methods visualizations that communicate analysis 
information to investigators, attorneys, judges, and jury members in a simple and clear 
way.  This research uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA), multivariate Gaussian 
distributions (MGD), Standard Deviation (STD), Python programming language, Perl 
programming language, and Gnuplot visualization software package to create and 
analyze instant messaging writeprints.  This section explains each of these statistical 
models and software packages. 
3.3.1  Statistical Methods 
 Principal component analysis is a statistical technique that reveals first order 
patterns in high dimension data.  PCA performs dimension reduction to reduce a large set 
of features to a small set that still retains most of the information as the large set.  
Datasets with a large number of features often suffer from the curse of dimensionality, 
which are the difficulties associated with analyzing high dimension data.  As the 
dimensionality increases, data becomes increasingly sparse in the space it occupies, 
leading to inaccurate and unreliable data models.  PCA’s dimensionality reduction 
eliminates irrelevant, weakly relevant, or redundant features and reduces noise.  It also 
leads to a more understandable model because the model has fewer attributes and it eases 
visualization.  PCA applies data transformation to create a reduced representation of the 
original data.  PCA simply rotates the underlying data space in order to create a new set 
 
 50 
of axes that capture the most variance in the data.  PCA creates new features, called 
principal components, that are: 
1. Linear combinations of the original features, 
2. Orthonormal to each other, and 
3. Able to capture the maximum amount of first order variation in the data. 
The first principal component is the axis on which the data has the most variance.  The 
second principal component is the axis orthogonal to the first that captures the next 
greatest variance, and so forth.  Two dimensions in which the original data strongly 
correlated would be captured as a single new dimension that is the vector sum of the 
original two dimensions.  For example, if the data to be compressed consists of N tuples 
(instances of IM conversations), from k dimensions (features), PCA searches for c k-
dimensional orthogonal vectors that can best be used to represent the data where c<=k.  
The first principal component accounts for as much of the variability in the data as 
possible, and each succeeding component accounts for as much of the remaining 
variability as possible.  In this research, PCA is performed using the following steps 
[Smi2002]: 
1. Subtract the mean.  For each dimension, calculate the average for that 
dimension across all tuples.  Subtract the mean from each dimension.  
Subtracting the mean centers the data by translating the coordinate system to 
the location of the mean. 
2. Calculate the covariance matrix. 
 
 51 
 
€ 
cov(X,Y ) =
(Xi − µx
i=1
n
∑ )(Yi − µy )
(n −1) , 
(3-3) 
 
where n is the sample size, µx is the mean of X , and µy is the mean of Y.  
Covariance calculates how much the dimensions vary from the mean with 
respect to each other.  A positive covariance indicates that the values increase 
together.  A negative covariance indicates an inverse relationship where as one 
increases the other decreases.  Covariance is used to find relationships between 
dimensions in high dimensional datasets where visualization is difficult.  This 
research has a covariance matrix of size 356x356.   
3. Calculate the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix.  
Calculating the matrix of eigenvectors diagonalizes the covariance matrix.  This 
research has 356 eigenvalues and a 356x356 eigenvector matrix. 
4. Form a feature vector with a specified number of eigenvectors.  The 
eigenvector with the highest eigenvalue is the principal component of the 
dataset.  After eigenvectors are created from the covariance matrix they are 
ordered by eigenvalue from highest to lowest.  Create a feature vector using the 
first p eigenvectors.  This research uses p=5. 
5. Convert the data points into the new space.  The location of the original data 
points are computed by projecting them onto the new coordinates, which is the 
dot product of the data points with the new axes.  After the PCA vector is 
created from the first p eigenvectors, take the dot product of the PCA vector 
 
 52 
and the data vector to create the final data coefficients that represent the data 
vector in the new space. 
PCA has been used in numerous previous authorship analysis studies and has been 
shown effective for online stylometric analysis [AC2008].  “PCA’s ability to capture 
essential variance across large numbers of features in a reduced dimensionality makes it 
attractive for text analysis problems, which typically involve large feature sets” 
[AC2008].  PCA was chosen for the IM writeprint analysis due to the high dimension 
stylometric feature set.  The 356-dimension feature set was created to provide a 
comprehensive capture of the stylistic features that are frequently found in IM 
communications.  However, in real world data, an author’s use of various features is 
often inconsistent.  There may be a large number of the 356 features that are not used by 
certain authors and some features used similarly across all authors.  This results in sparse 
data, irrelevant features, and weakly relevant features.  PCA is used to reduce the number 
of necessary dimensions, highlight similarities and differences, and ease visualization.  
The reduced data is visualized using graphing tools and then input to MGD and STD for 
analysis. 
 A multivariate Gaussian distribution is a generalization of the Gaussian 
distribution to higher dimensions.  The multivariate Gaussian distribution equation used 
in this research is 
 
€ 
y = Αexp −
1
2
x − µ( )Τ ∑−1 x − µ( )
& 
' 
( 
) 
* 
+ , 
(3-4) 
 
 
 53 
where x is the test vector, µ is the mean, and ∑ is the covariance matrix of the Gaussian.  
The covariance matrix is 5x5 since it uses the first 5 PCA coefficients.  In this research y 
returns P(x|Author) or P(x|Category), which is the probability of the test vector given the 
provided author or author category, also called the likelihood. 
The Gaussian distributions are used to determine the probability of the author or 
author category of the test writeprint.  MGD is performed using the following steps (the 
same process is used for both author identification and author characterization): 
1. Choose the sample data.  The reduced dimension PCA files for each author in 
the sample are input for MGD processing.  An example file list may be 
data1_250_user1, data1_250_user2, and data1_250_user3.  These files contain 
writeprint data for Authors 1, 2, and 3 for a conversation size of 250 messages.  
Each file contains x, y, and z writeprints, respectively. 
2. Choose the test writeprint data.  A sample author test file is selected for 
analysis.  For example, a test file may be data1_250_user2.  This file contains w 
writeprints for Author 2 using a conversation size of 250 messages. 
3. Assess each test writeprint within each distribution.  Using leave one out 
cross validation, each writeprint of the author test file is used as the test vector 
to calculate the Gaussian distribution using the mean and covariance for each 
author or category file in the sample.  The result returns the P(x|author) or 
P(x|category), also known as the likelihood. 
4. Determine posterior probability for author identification or 
characterization.  Determine the posterior probability, P(Author|x), for each 
 
 54 
author or author category in the sample given the test writeprint.  For example, 
the author under test, data2_250_user2, may have the following probability 
results across the sample: data1_250_user1 = 20%, data1_250_user2 = 70%, 
data1_250_user3 = 10%.  Probability P(Author|x) is calculated using Bayes 
Rule: 
 
€ 
P(Authori | x) = P(x | Authori)P(Authori)
P(x) , (3-5) 
 
Prior probability in this research is equally distributed.  For example, a test using 
5 authors would have the following prior probabilities: P(A1) = 20%, P(A2) = 
20%, P(A3) = 20%, P(A4) = 20%, P(A5) = 20%.  P(x) is calculated as 
P(x|A1)P(A1) + P(x|A2)P(A2) + P(x|A3)P(A3).  
MGD was chosen for the IM writeprint analysis due to successful results in other 
forensics and behavioral biometrics research [RMG1998], [Man2012], [RQD2000], 
[MD2001].  Because MGD is based on means it tends to be less sensitive to outliers, 
making it well suited for the IM writeprint analysis. 
The standard deviation measures the spread of distribution of a set of data by 
calculating distance from the mean of the data.  If the data points are very close together 
(close to the mean), the standard deviation will be low.  If the data points are spread out 
(far from the mean), the standard deviation will be high.  IM conversation sizes are 
analyzed in more detail by calculating the standard deviation of the data within each 
 
 55 
conversation size.  The standard deviation is calculated for the first 5 dimensions of the 
PCA data using the formula 
 
€ 
σ =
(x − µ)2∑
n , 
(3-6) 
 
where x is the value of the dimension, µ is the sample mean, and n is the sample size.  
The first 5 dimensions represent those with the most variability in the data with 
decreasing variability from 1 to 5.  Dimensions after the 5th do not provide significant 
variability to be included. 
3.3.2  Software 
This research uses the Python programming language to calculate PCA, MGD, 
and STD.  Python permits several programming styles, such as object oriented and 
structured, and has a large standard library.  This research uses the Numpy and Scipy 
libraries [JOP2001].  Numpy adds support for linear algebra, standard deviation, and 
large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.  Scipy adds modules for image processing 
and uses the arrays provided by Numpy.  This research also uses the Python Imaging 
Library (PIL) to create Gnuplot files. 
 This research also uses Gnuplot to visualize the PCA data.  Gnuplot is a command 
line-driven interactive plotting program.  This research uses Gnuplot to plot three-
dimensional plots of the PCA data. 
 
 56 
This research, in addition, uses the Perl programming language to process text 
input and output.  Perl is a programming language originally designed for text 
manipulation but has matured over the years to be used for more complex tasks such as 
Web development and database integration.  This research uses Perl to process the raw 
IM messages and to create author writeprints. 
3.4  Dataset Descriptions 
This research uses two datasets: a personally collected dataset of known authors 
(Dataset #1) and a publicly available dataset (Dataset #2), with 19 and 105 authors 
respectively.  Although the datasets contains a small number of authors to analyze, the 
number of suspects in a criminal investigation is usually less than 10 [IBFD2013].  Both 
datasets contain point-to-point messages communicated between two users.  Very few 
related works have studied the IM domain, and those that have performed IM authorship 
attribution research, such as [AC2008], have achieved very poor results.  Other research, 
such as [DMCT2011] often use multicast chat logs instead of point-to-point IM.  Both 
datasets used in this research are ground-truth, forensically feasible datasets.  For 
authorship identification ground-truth data contains data for which the author is known.  
For authorship characterization ground-truth data contains data for which the author 
demographics are known. [IBFD2013] uses gender and location data for its dataset from 
blogger.com.  However, data from an online source is not verified as ground-truth and 
could lead to untrustworthy results.  Both datasets used in this research are forensically 
feasible data.  Forensically feasible data represents the kind of data found in actual cases, 
often brief, messy, unedited, and sparse. [Cha2013] 
 
 57 
3.4.1  Description of Dataset #1: Known Authors 
Dataset #1 contains personal IM conversation logs collected by the Gaim and 
Adium clients over a three-year period.  Although, the authors permitted the analysis and 
use of the data, anonymity of the authors is protected.  Appendix B provides a breakdown 
of Dataset #1, including author demographics.  The author demographics were collected 
from personal knowledge of each author. 
3.4.2  Description of Dataset #2: U.S. Cyberwatch 
Dataset #2 contains publicly available data from U.S. Cyberwatch.  U.S. 
Cyberwatch aims to assist law enforcement with the interception, apprehension, and 
prosecution of online child predators.  It also provides training and assistance to law 
enforcement agencies in addressing this area of cybercrime.  The data includes 105 
complete IM logs between undercover agents and child predators (all male authors).  The 
logs have been verified via chain of custody.  The data also contains metadata such as the 
suspect’s real name, screen name, photograph, age, location, and conviction details.  
Appendix C provides a breakdown of Dataset #2, including author demographics.  The 5 
authors with the least number of messages were not used in the experiments in this 
dissertation because the number of messages was too small for sufficient testing.  The 
U.S. Cyberwatch data is an example of real world cybercrime digital evidence that cyber 
forensics investigators are obtaining, analyzing, and presenting in court proceedings 
[Tur2008]. 
 
 58 
3.4.3  Dataset Limitations 
The two datasets present the following limitations that must be considered when 
processing and analyzing the data: 
1. Dataset #2 contains less messages per author, resulting in fewer writeprint 
instances to analyze. (i.e. the largest conversations size is 90 messages per 
conversation, whereas Dataset #2 contains 500 messages per conversation as its 
largest conversation size).  Although Dataset #2 contains smaller conversations, 
it still has an average of 2125 words per author, compared to [CRSBVM2012] 
that had a dataset with 615 words per author. 
2. Dataset #2 contains only one gender (men) and age for authorship 
characterization analysis. 
3. Dataset #1 is imbalanced in terms of authorship characterization due to twice as 
many females than males in the gender category.  Dataset #2 is imbalanced in 
terms of authorship characterization due to the majority of authors residing in 
the twenties age category.  This imbalance could lead to a bias toward the 
majority class. 
3.5  Summary 
This chapter presented the research methodology for creating and analyzing IM 
behavioral biometrics-based writeprints to assist with cybercrime investigations.  The 
research methodology uses authorship analysis techniques to create an IM-specific 
stylometric feature set robust enough to show separation between authors and between 
 
 59 
author categories. 
This chapter presented a detailed explanation of how to prepare the IM data for 
writeprint creation.  Preprocessing software is used to extract the stylometric features into 
a 356-dimensional vector writeprint including lexical, syntactic, and structural features.  
Preprocessing also involves normalizing and standardizing the writeprints prior to input 
into statistical models so large values don't dominate the results of statistical models.  
Normalization and standardization ensures that features with a wide range of values are 
less likely to outweigh features with smaller ranges.  It allows data on different scales to 
be compared by bringing them to a common scale, thus allowing the underlying 
characteristics of the data sets to be compared.  The research methodology uses the PCA 
and MGD statistical methods and graphical software to analyze and evaluate author 
writeprints from IM conversation logs from two distinct datasets for authorship 
identification and characterization.  This research evaluates the effectiveness of the 
writeprints using different parameters such as the number of messages used as input.  
PCA was chosen for the IM writeprint analysis due to the high dimension stylometric 
feature set.  The reduced data is visualized using graphing tools and then input to MGD 
and STD for analysis.  Test writeprints are assessed against MGDs for authors and author 
categories to determine the identification and characterization probability.  MGD was 
chosen for the IM writeprint analysis due to successful results in other forensics and 
behavioral biometrics research.  The standard deviation measures the spread of 
distribution of a set of data by calculating distance from the mean of the data. 
In addition, this chapter presented details for two datasets: a personally collected 
 
 60 
dataset of known authors (Dataset #1) and a publicly available dataset (Dataset #2), with 
19 and 105 authors respectively.  The research methodology presented in this chapter 
provides cybercrime investigators a unique tool for investigating IM-assisted 
cybercrimes.  The analysis of IM author writeprints in this research provides a foundation 
for using behavioral biometrics as a cyber forensics element of criminal investigations.

4.  EXPERIMENT RESULTS AND ANALYSIS 
 
 
 
The purpose of this research is to create and analyze behavioral biometrics-based 
instant messaging writeprints to assist in identifying online cyber criminals and collecting 
digital evidence as part of the criminal investigation.  This research uses an IM-specific 
stylometric feature set to show separation between authors and between author 
categories.  Authorship identification is applied to IM communications to compare and 
analyze writeprints of various authors.  Authorship characterization is applied to IM 
communications to compare and analyze writeprints of authors based on the 
sociolinguistic attributes gender, age, and educational background.  This research uses 
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the number of necessary dimensions, 
highlight similarities and differences, and visualize writeprints for comparison.  This 
research uses the multivariate Gaussian distributions (MGD) to determine identification 
and characterization probabilities for a set of messages across authors and author 
categories.  This section provides a detailed analysis of the results of the IM writeprint 
analysis conducted on both the Known Authors (Dataset #1) and U.S. Cyberwatch 
(Dataset #2) datasets. 
For each author, IM writeprints are divided into conversations with incrementing 
number of messages (for example 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 125, 250, and 500 messages per 
conversation).  As the number of messages for each conversation increases, the number 
 
 62 
of writeprint instances for each author decreases.  For example, a set of 10,000 messages 
divided into 250 messages per conversation results in 40 writeprint instances and the 
same set divided into 50 messages per conversation results in 200 writeprint instances.  A 
high number of writeprint instances results in several data points on the PCA plot, and a 
low number of writeprint instances results in fewer data points on the PCA plot.  Thus, a 
conversation with a large number of messages contains more data to create a writeprint 
representative of the author’s true writing style, but results in less instances of the 
writeprint available for analysis.  The total number of messages for each author in the 
dataset ultimately determines the number of writeprint instances for each author. 
The coefficients of the first three principal components are plotted, allowing the 
PCA data to be viewed in 3-dimensions.  The PCA data can then be rotated and analyzed 
at different viewpoints.  Data viewed in flat 2-dimensions may appear to overlap, 
however, viewing the data in a rotational 3-dimensional space reveals separation. 
The MGD algorithm processes the writeprints for each set of messages 
(conversations) for an author or author category under test and the output is analyzed to 
determine the identification and characterization probability.  The aggregate results 
across all conversations in each test are presented in table matrices. 
Standard deviation is used to analyze the spread of the distribution of data within 
each conversation size.  Standard deviation results for the first 5 PCA dimensions for all 
authors are presented graphically to show the relationship of standard deviation and 
conversation size.

4.1  Results for Dataset #1, Known Authors 
Dataset #1 experiments include 19 authors.  For each author, IM writeprints are 
divided into conversations containing 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 125, 250, and 500 messages 
respectively. 
4.1.1  Authorship Identification Results 
Authorship identification attempts to determine whether an author An of a given set 
of IM messages {M1,…,Mp} is likely to be one of the author suspects {A1,…,An}.  
Dataset #1 experiments include 19 authors from which to determine identification. 
Figure 4-1 shows Dataset #1 PCA plot results for conversations consisting of 250 
messages for each of the 19 authors.  This plot does show some separation between the 
authors.

Table 4-6 show the MGD results for conversation sizes of 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, and 125 
messages respectively for all 19 authors.  Using 100 messages per conversation as input, 
MGD identifies conversations as the correct author for 17 of the 19 authors, with 
probabilities ranging from 71.51% to 100%.  Using 125 messages per conversation as 
input, MGD identifies conversations as the correct author for 17 of the 19 authors, with 
probabilities ranging from 82.14% to 100%.  The tables show a significant increase in 
identification probabilities as the number of messages per conversation increase.  Figure 
4-2 shows the relationship between the identification probability and number of messages 
per conversation.

Figure 4-2.  Dataset 1, Identification Probability vs. Number of Messages, All 19 Authors 
 
 
 
The authorship identification probability is used to determine the error of the 
multivariate Gaussian distribution by assessing writeprint false positives.  The likelihood, 
P(x|Author), of the author of the writperint is used as a minimum threshold.  If another 
author has a higher likelihood, this is a false positive.  Dataset #1 analysis for all 19 
authors achieved less than 20% error for most authors using 125 messages per 
conversation.  Figure 4-3 shows that as the conversation size increases, the error rate 
decreases.

Figure 4-3.  Dataset #1, All 19 Authors Error 
 
 
 
Figure 4-4 through Figure 4-8 show PCA plots of Dataset #1 author writeprints 
broken down into 6, 6, and 7 authors respectively.  Figure 4-4 shows Dataset #1 PCA plot 
results for conversations consisting of 250 messages for Authors A1-A6.  This plot shows 
separate groupings for each author.

Figure 4-4.  Dataset 1, PCA Plot Results, 250 Messages, Authors A1-A6 
 
 
 
Table 4-7 through  
 
 
Table 4-12 show the MGD results for conversation sizes of 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, and 
125 messages respectively for Authors A1-A6.  Using 100 messages per conversation as 
input, MGD identifies conversations as the correct author for 5 of the 6 authors, with 
probability ranging from 91.93% to 100%.  Using 125 messages per conversation as 
input, MGD identifies conversations as the correct author for all 6 authors, with 
probability over 99% across all authors.  The tables show a significant increase in 
identification probability as the number of messages per conversation increase.  Figure 
4-5 shows the relationship between the identification probability and number of messages 
per conversation.

Table 4-30 show the MGD results for conversation sizes of 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, and 
125 messages respectively for all authors divided into small sets.  Using 100 messages 
per conversation as input, MGD identifies conversations as the correct author with 
probability ranging from 82.39% to 100%.  Using 125 messages per conversation as 
input, MGD identifies conversations as the correct author with probability ranging from 
86.39% to 100%.  Given the smaller number of authors for identification, many tests 
resulted in probability from 70%-100% using just 50 messages per conversation.  The 
tables show a significant increase in identification probability as the number of messages 
per conversation increase.  Figure 4-11 through Figure 4-16 show the relationship 
between the identification probability and number of messages per conversation.

Figure 4-17 shows Dataset #1 PCA plot results for the 7 authors with the highest 
total number of messages (Authors A2, A4, A5, A11, A12, A14, A16, respectively), 
resulting in the highest number of writeprint instances.  The conversations consist of 250 
messages for each writeprint instance.  This plot shows separate groupings for each 
author.

A12, A14, A16).  Using 100 messages per conversation as input, MGD identifies 
conversations as the correct author for all 7 authors, with probability ranging from 
81.00% to 100%.  Using 500 messages per conversation as input, MGD identifies 
conversations as the correct author for all 7 authors, with probability ranging from 
99.85% to 100%.  The tables show a significant increase in identification probability as 
the number of messages per conversation increase.  Figure 4-18 shows the relationship 
between the identification probability and number of messages per conversation.

Figure 4-18.  Dataset 1, Identification Probability vs. Number of Messages, Top 7 Authors 
 
 
 
Dataset #1 analysis for all the top 7 authors achieved less than 20% error for all 
authors using 250 messages per conversation.  Figure 4-19 shows that as the conversation 
size increases, the error rate decreases.

Figure 4-20 shows the Dataset #1 PCA data plots for a single author (Author A14) 
over the full range of conversation sizes (5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 125, 250, and 500 messages 
respectively).  The data shows as the number of messages per conversation increase, the 
data points become more tightly grouped.  This demonstrates that as the messages per 
conversation increase, the writeprint becomes more cohesive.

Figure 4-20.  Dataset 1, PCA Plot Results, Author A14, All Conversation Sizes 
 
 
 
Conversation size can be analyzed in more detail by calculating the standard 
deviation of the data within each conversation size.  The standard deviation measures the 
spread of distribution of a set of data by calculating distance from the mean of the data.  
If the data points are very close together (close to the mean), the standard deviation will 
be low.  If the data points are spread out (far from the mean), the standard deviation will 
be high.  Figure 4-21 shows the inverse relationship of standard deviation and 
conversation size for the Author A14 results shown in Figure 4-20.  As the conversation 
size increases (i.e. number of messages per conversation), the standard deviation 
decreases.  This shows that with larger conversations sizes an author’s writeprint 
becomes more concise and is likely more representative of the author’s true writing style.

The standard deviation of the data is calculated for the first 5 PCA dimensions for 
all 19 authors in Dataset 1.  As shown in Table 4-39, 96% of the 95 values exhibited 
decreased standard deviation as the conversation size increased.

samples of messages from Authors A2 and A12, respectively.  The conversations consist 
of 250 messages for each writeprint instance.  These results show that an individual 
author’s writeprint is consistent over multiple samples.  The overlapping PCA data points 
show writeprint similarity for an author over multiple distinct samples.  Outliers tend to 
be the result of conversation topic.  For example, an author may insert a few URLs into 
the conversation and this would create an outlier due to the special characters (:, /, /, etc.) 
that are not normally used by this author.

Dataset #1 Known Authors provides some beneficial metadata to assist analysis.  
Figure 4-24 shows the family diagram of five related authors.  The following tests were 
performed to determine if writeprints of family members show greater similarity than 
those of unrelated authors.

125, and 250 messages respectively for the 5 related authors (Authors A1, A2, A8, A11, 
A12).  Using 100 messages per conversation as input, MGD identifies conversations as 
the correct author for all 5 authors, with probability ranging from 84.59% to 100%.  
Using 250 messages per conversation as input, MGD identifies conversations as the 
correct author for all 5 authors with probability ranging from 99.94% to 100%.  The 
tables show a significant increase in identification probability as the number of messages 
per conversation increase.  Figure 4-26 shows the relationship between the identification 
probability and number of messages per conversation.  The PCA plots and MGD results 
 
 107 
do not show any significant differences between related authors and unrelated authors 
from previous tests.  Both related authors and unrelated authors showed similar 
identification probability across various conversation sizes.

Using 100 messages per conversation as input, MGD identifies conversations as the 
correct author for all 3 authors, with probability ranging from 91.93% to 100%.  Using 
250 messages per conversation as input, MGD identifies conversations as the correct 
author for all 3 authors with 100% probability.  Given the smaller number of authors for 
identification, tests resulted in probability from 81.40%-86.22% using just 50 messages 
per conversation.  The tables show a significant increase in identification probability as 
the number of messages per conversation increase.  Figure 4-28 shows the relationship 
between the identification probability and number of messages per conversation.

4.1.2  Authorship Characterization Results 
Authorship characterization attempts to determine whether a given set of IM 
messages {M1,…,Mq} is likely to be one a of the author categories {C1,…,Cm}. 
Dataset #1 includes 2 categories (male and female) for gender, 3 categories for 
age (20s, 30s, >40), and 2 categories for education (high school and college) from which 
to analyze characterization.  Figure 4-35 shows the breakdown of the number of authors 
for each author category. 
 
 
 
 
 120 
 
Figure 4-35.  Dataset 1 Characterization Breakdown 
 
 
 
Dataset #1 experiments include 19 authors from which to determine 
characterization.  Figure 4-36 shows Dataset #1 PCA plot results for the gender category.  
The conversations consist of 500 messages for each writeprint instance.  The plot shows 
some separation for the gender category.

Table 4-51 shows the MGD results for conversation sizes of 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 
125, 250, and 500 messages respectively for the gender category.  Using 100 messages 
per conversation as input, MGD identifies conversations as the correct gender, with 
probability ranging from 74.76% to 88.23%.  Using 500 messages per conversation as 
input, MGD identifies conversations as the correct gender, with probability ranging from 
99.19% to 99.96%.  The unbalanced gender data (more females than males) may present 
a slight gender bias at conversations sizes 25 through 250.  The tables show a significant 
increase in characterization probability as the number of messages per conversation 
increase.  Figure 4-37 shows the relationship between the characterization probability and 
number of messages per conversation.

The authorship characterization probability is used to determine the error of the 
multivariate Gaussian distribution by assessing writeprint false positives.  The likelihood, 
P(x|Category), of the author category of the writperint is used as a minimum threshold.  If 
another author category has a higher likelihood, this is a false positive.  Dataset #1 
analysis for the gender category achieved less than 20% error using 250 messages per 
conversation.  Figure 4-38 shows that as the conversation size increases, the error rate 
decreases.

Table 4-53 shows the MGD results for conversation sizes of 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 
125, 250, and 500 messages respectively for the age category.  Using 500 messages per 
conversation as input, MGD identifies conversations as the correct age, with probability 
ranging from 75.48% to 99.85%.  The age category “Thirties” had the most overlap with 
the other age categories.  The tables show a significant increase in characterization 
probability as the number of messages per conversation increase.  Figure 4-43 shows the 
relationship between the characterization probability and number of messages per 
conversation.

Dataset #1 analysis for the age category shows higher error rates due to more 
overlap between the age categories.   The twenties and over forty categories achieved less 
than 20% error using 250 messages per conversation.  The thirties category shows the 
most overlap, and thus the highest number of false positives.  Figure 4-44 shows that as 
the conversation size increases, the error rate decreases.

4.2  Results for Dataset #2, U.S. Cyberwatch 
Dataset #2 experiments include 100 authors.  For each author, IM writeprints are 
divided into conversations containing 10, 25, 50, and 90 messages respectively.

4.2.1  Authorship Identification Results  
Authorship identification attempts to determine whether an author An of a given set 
of IM messages {M1,…,Mp} is likely to be one of the author suspects {A1,…,An}.  
Dataset #2 experiments include 100 authors from which to determine identification. 
Figure 4-45 shows Dataset #2 PCA plot results for the 20 authors with the highest 
total number of messages (Authors A2, A3, A7, A11, A16, A20, A30, A32, A41, A44, 
A69, A72, A74, A77, A79, A80, A85, A89, A94, A100, respectively), resulting in the 
highest number of writeprint instances.  The conversations consist of 90 messages for 
each writeprint instance.  This plot does show some separation between the authors.

Table 4-57 shows the MGD results for conversation sizes of 10, 25, 50, and 90 
messages respectively for the top 20 authors (Authors A2, A3, A7, A11, A16, A20, A30, 
A32, A41, A44, A69, A72, A74, A77, A79, A80, A85, A89, A94, A100).  Using 90 
messages per conversation as input, MGD identifies conversations as the correct author 
for 19 of the 20 authors, with probability ranging from 71.65% to 100%.  The tables 
show a significant increase in identification probability as the number of messages per 
conversation increase.  Figure 4-46 shows the relationship between the identification 
probability and number of messages per conversation.

correct author for all 6 authors, with probability ranging from 64.26% to 100%.  Using 90 
messages per conversation as input, MGD identifies conversations as the correct author 
for all 6 authors, with probability ranging from 96.97% to 100%.  The tables show a 
significant increase in identification probability as the number of messages per

Figure 4-57 shows the PCA data plots for a single author (Author A100) over the 
full range of conversation sizes (10, 25, 50, and 90 messages respectively).  The data 
shows as the number of messages per conversation increase, the data points become more 
 
 149 
tightly grouped.  This demonstrates that as the messages per conversation increase, the 
writeprint becomes more cohesive.

Figure 4-57.  Dataset 2, PCA Plot Results, Author A100, All Conversation Sizes 
 
 
 
Conversation size can be analyzed in more detail by calculating the standard 
deviation of the data within each conversation size.  Figure 4-58 shows the inverse 
relationship of standard deviation and conversation size for the Author A100 results 
 
 150 
shown in Figure 4-57.  As the conversation size increases (i.e. number of messages per 
conversation), the standard deviation decreases.  This shows that with larger 
conversations sizes an author’s writeprint becomes more concise and is likely more 
representative of the author’s true writing style.

The standard deviation of the data is calculated for the first 5 PCA dimensions for all 100 
authors in Dataset 2.  As shown in  
 
 
 
 
Table 4-68, 86% of the 500 values exhibited decreased standard deviation as the 
conversation size increased.

Figure 4-59 and Figure 4-60 show Dataset #2 PCA plot results for multiple 
samples of messages from Authors A3 and A7, respectively.  The conversations consist 
of 50 messages for each writeprint instance.  These results show that an individual 
author’s writeprint is consistent over multiple samples.  The overlapping PCA data points 
show writeprint similarity for an author over multiple distinct samples.

4.2.2  Authorship Characterization Results 
Authorship characterization attempts to determine whether a given set of IM 
messages {M1,…,Mq} is likely to be one a of the author categories {C1,…,Cm}. 
Dataset #2 includes 4 categories for age (<20, 20s, 30s, >40) from which to 
analyze categorization. Figure 4-61 shows the breakdown of the number of authors for 
the age category. 
 
 
 
 
Figure 4-61.  Dataset 2 Characterization Breakdown 
 
 
 
Dataset #2 experiments include 100 authors from which to determine 
characterization.   Figure 4-62 shows Dataset #2 PCA plot results for the all age 
categories.  The conversations consist of 90 messages for each writeprint instance.  The 
results show considerable overlap in writeprints across age categories.

Table 4-69 through  
 
 
Table 4-72 shows the MGD results for conversation sizes of 10, 25, 50, and 90 
messages respectively for the age category.  Using 90 messages per conversation as 
input, MGD identifies conversations as the correct age for 3 of the 4 age categories, with 
probability ranging from 43.12% to 61.61%.  The MGD results validate the considerable 
overlap in writeprints for the Dataset #2 age category.  Given that the age data is 
unbalanced (the majority of authors in the twenties category), the results do not show a 
bias towards the twenties category.  The tables show an increase in characterization 
probability as the number of messages per conversation increase.  Figure 4-63 shows the 
 
 155 
relationship between the characterization probability and number of messages per 
conversation.

The authorship characterization probability is used to determine the error of the 
multivariate Gaussian distribution by assessing writeprint false positives.  The likelihood, 
P(x|Category), of the author category of the writperint is used as a minimum threshold.  If 
another author category has a higher likelihood, this is a false positive.  Dataset #2 
analysis for the age category shows high error rates due to more overlap between the age 
categories.  The thirites category achieved a 20% error using 90 messages per 
conversation.  The less than twenty and over forty categories show the most overlap, and 
thus the highest number of false positives.  Figure 4-64 shows that as the conversation 
size increases, the error rate decreases.

Table 4-73 shows the MGD results for conversation sizes of 10, 25, 50, and 90 
messages respectively for the over forty and less than twenty age categories.  Using 25 
messages per conversation as input, MGD identifies conversations as the correct age for 
both age categories, with probability ranging from 71.07% to 94.02%.  Using 90 
messages per conversation as input, MGD identifies conversations as the correct age for 
both age categories, with probability ranging from 74.70% to 98.67%.  The MGD results 
show distinction between the writeprints for the Dataset #2 over forty and less than 
twenty age categories.  Given that the age data is unbalanced (more authors in the over 
forty category), the results may indicate a slight bias towards the over forty category.  
The tables show an increase in characterization probability as the number of messages

per conversation increase.  Figure 4-66 shows the relationship between the 
characterization probability and number of messages per conversation.

Dataset #1, Known Authors and Dataset #2, U.S. Cyberwatch.  PCA was used to reduce 
the number of dimensions and provide visualization data.  The coefficients of the first 
three principal components were plotted, allowing the PCA data to be viewed in 3-
 
 170 
dimensions.  In most cases, the PCA plots showed separate grouping for each author and 
author category, with the age category showing the least separation.  PCA data plots for a 
single author over the full range of conversation sizes (5, 10, 25, 50, 100, 125, 250, and 
500 messages respectively) showed tightly grouped data points as the number of 
messages per conversation increased.  These plots demonstrated that as the messages per 
conversation increase, the writeprint becomes more cohesive.  Standard deviation was 
used to analyze the spread of the distribution of data within each conversation size.  
Standard deviation results for the first 5 PCA dimensions for authors were presented 
graphically to show the relationship of standard deviation and conversation size.  The 
graphs show decreased standard deviation as the conversation size increased (i.e. number 
of messages per conversation).  This demonstrates that with larger conversations sizes an 
author’s writeprint becomes more concise and is likely more representative of the 
author’s true writing style.  PCA plot results for multiple samples of messages from the 
same author showed that an individual author’s writeprint is consistent over multiple 
distinct samples. 
MGD was used to determine identification and characterization probability of a set 
of messages across authors and author categories.  The MGD algorithm processed each 
set of messages (conversations) for an author or author category under test and the output 
was analyzed to determine the identification and characterization probability for each 
conversation across all authors or author categories.  Results were presented in table 
matrices for multiple author group sizes and varying conversation size.  The results 
showed a significant increase in probability as the number of messages per conversation 
 
 171 
increase. 
The results in this chapter demonstrated the effectiveness of creating IM author 
writeprints that show separation between authors and between author categories.  The 
results show that writeprints can differentiate messages belonging to a particular author 
Ai from a set of authors {A1,…,An} and can differentiate messages belonging to a 
particular author category Ci, from a set of author categories {C1,…,Cm}.

5.  SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS 
 
 
This research created and analyzed behavioral biometrics-based instant messaging 
writeprints to use as input for cybercrime investigations.  This research used authorship 
analysis techniques to create a set of stylometric features robust enough to show 
separation between authors and between author categories.  This research used the 
statistical methods Principal Component Analysis (PCA), multivariate Gaussian 
distributions (MGD), and Standard Deviation to analyze IM conversation logs from two 
distinct data sets for authorship identification and characterization. 
The research methodology used authorship analysis and statistical techniques to 
create and analyze IM writeprints to assist in identifying an author, as well as certain 
characteristics of the author of a set of IM messages.  This research performed authorship 
identification to assist in identifying individual IM authors.  In cybercrime investigations, 
authorship identification may assist in identifying criminals who hide their true identify 
or impersonate a known individual.  This research performed authorship characterization 
to assist in identifying sociolinguistic categories of authors.  In cybercrime investigations, 
authorship characterization may assist in discovering IM cyber criminals who supply 
false information in their virtual identifies, such as gender. 
This dissertation provides a foundation for using behavioral biometrics as a cyber 
forensics element for cybercrime investigations by demonstrating the effectiveness of 
 
173 
creating instant messaging author writeprints to be used in conjunction with traditional 
investigation techniques.  This research contributes a new technique to assist cybercrime 
decision support tools in collecting and analyzing digital evidence, discovering 
characteristics about the cyber criminal, and assisting in identifying cyber criminal 
suspects.  Writeprints may be used in conjunction with other evidence and investigative 
techniques as an element in multimodal biometrics to aid the investigation process.  
Criminal investigators may use the IM-specific stylometric taxonomy and statistical 
methods provided in this dissertation to create and analyze writeprints as part of a 
cybercrime investigation. 
The writeprint analysis results in this dissertation achieved the following goals: 
1. Creating writeprints that show separation between authors and author 
categories, 
2. Creating writeprints that can differentiate messages belonging to a 
particular author Ai from a set of authors {A1,…,An}, and 
3. Creating writeprints that can differentiate messages belonging to a 
particular author category Ci, from a set of author categories {C1,…,Cm} 
based on sociolinguistic attributes. 
For authorship identification, the PCA plots for both datasets clearly show 
separation of author writeprints at large conversation sizes.  Dataset #1 shows separation 
of author writeprints using 250 and 500 messages per conversation.  Dataset #2 shows 
separation of author writeprints using 90 messages per conversation.  The standard 
 
174 
deviation analysis for conversation sizes in both datasets shows that as the number of 
messages in the conversation increase, the standard deviation decreases, indicating the 
writeprint becomes more cohesive.  For Dataset #1, 96% of the PCA dimensions showed 
a decrease in standard deviation as the conversation size increased.  For Dataset #2, 86% 
of PCA dimensions showed a decrease in standard deviation as the conversation size 
increased.  The percentage of authors in Dataset #2 showing a decrease in standard 
deviation as the conversation size increases is less because the total amount of data per 
author is limited and the maximum conversation size is 90 messages per conversation.  If 
Dataset #2 had more messages for each author leading to larger conversation sizes, the 
percentages may be higher.  However, given the limited data, 86% still demonstrates that 
as the conversation size increases, the standard deviation decreases for most authors.  The 
standard deviation results demonstrate that with larger conversation sizes an author’s 
writeprint is more likely to reflect the author’s true writing style. 
 
 
 
Table 5-1 shows the authorship identification results for Dataset #1 tests for 
conversations sizes of 50-500 messages.  Authorship analysis identification results 
greater than 70% are acceptable during an investigation process [IBFD2013].  Results 
with a maximum probability less than 70% are designated with a “T” for trivial.  A 
conversation size of 100 messages demonstrated identification probability of 71.51-100% 
across all tests.  For tests with fewer authors, smaller conversation sizes (i.e. 50 messages 
per conversation) resulted in identification probability over 90%.  For authorship 
 
175 
identification, the MGD results show a significant increase in identification probability as 
the number of messages per conversation increases, indicating a more distinct writeprint 
at larger conversation sizes.

Dataset #1 included some author metadata to assist with additional analysis.  The 
metadata included familial and marital information that was used to analyze specific 
authors for similar traits based on their relationships.  The PCA plots and MGD results do 
not show any significant result differences for related authors.  Related author writeprints 
are just as distinct as non-related authors.  Authors 2 and 12 spend a considerable amount 
 
176 
of time instant messaging each other, but still show separation of writeprints.  Although 
this is a single test, this may indicate that authors do not appear to pick up enough traits 
from their IM buddy’s writing style to influence their own writeprint. 
 
 
 
Table 5-2 shows the authorship characterization results for Dataset #1 tests for 
conversations sizes of 50-500 messages.  Results with a maximum probability less than 
70% are designated with a “T” for trivial.  Both the Gender and Education categories 
demonstrated high probability using a minimum conversation size of 100 messages.  The 
unbalanced gender data (more females than males) may present a slight gender bias for 
the female category.  The Age category did not perform as well, requiring a large 
conversation size of 500 messages to reach characterization probability over 75%.  The 
age category “Thirties” had the most overlap with the other age categories.  However, 
this is expected as authors in the Thirties category may be at either end of the category 
(30 or 39) and could easily overlap with adjacent categories.  For authorship 
characterization, the MGD results show a significant increase in characterization 
probability as the number of messages per conversation increases, indicating a more 
distinct writeprint at larger conversation sizes.

Table 5-3 shows the authorship identification results for Dataset #2 tests for 
conversations sizes of 50-90 messages.  Results with a maximum probability less than 
70% are designated with a “T” for trivial.  A conversation size of 90 messages 
demonstrated identification probability at 71.65-100% across all tests.  For authorship 
identification, the MGD results show a significant increase in identification probability as 
the number of messages per conversation increases, indicating a more distinct writeprint 
at larger conversation sizes.  Dataset #2 results present similar identification probability 
ranges as the Dataset #1 results, indicating consistency across the tests for both datasets.

Table 5-4 shows the authorship characterization results for Dataset #2 tests for 
conversations sizes of 50-90 messages.  Results with a maximum probability less than 
70% are designated with a “T” for trivial.  Dataset #2 did not provide significant results 
 
178 
for the age category.  There was considerable overlap of category writeprints, especially 
the less than twenty category that was consistently misidentified as the twenties and 
thirties age categories.  Given that the age data is unbalanced (more authors in the 
twenties category), the results may show a bias towards the twenties category.  These 
results for Dataset #2 are consisted with results from Dataset #1, which also had the 
poorest results for the age category.  Gender and education were not tested for Dataset #2 
since all authors were male and education level was unknown.  Although gender and 
education offer promising results for authorship characterization, more research is needed 
using age as sociolinguistic category to determine if it can be used to assist in creating a 
cybercriminal profile.

The authorship identification and characterization probability is used to determine the 
error of the multivariate Gaussian distribution by assessing writeprint false positives.  
The likelihood, P(x|Author) or P(x|Cateogry), of the author or author category of the 
writperint is used as a minimum threshold to assess false positives.  This research 
resulted in lower error rates than related works such as [AC2008], [CRSBVM2012], and 
[IBFD2013]. [AC2008] achieved error rates of 68.3% - 49.6% using the Cyberwatch 
 
179 
dataset.  [CRSBVM2012] and [IBFD2013] achieved 10.5% and 30.25% respectively 
using Skype chat and blog datasets. 
 
 
Table 5-5 shows a summary of error rates for both datasets.  The error results 
demonstrate that conversations with a larger number messages or more offer the best 
results.

This dissertation research lends itself to a few extensions that provide potential 
future areas of research.  This research may be applied to other datasets to demonstrate 
the scalability and feasibility of IM writeprints in other environments and using different 
sociolinguistic categories.  Additionally, analyzing the effectiveness and applicability of 
this research using other languages would be an interesting study area.  Lastly, an 
important research extension is applying the authorship analysis techniques to perform 
masquerade detection, including assessing the impact of intentional alteration of online 
writing habits.

This dissertation addresses the existing research gap in applying authorship 
analysis techniques to instant messaging communications to facilitate authorship 
identification and characterization.  It provides a new approach and techniques to assist in 
identifying cyber criminal suspects and collecting digital evidence as part of the 
investigation.  The research provides cybercrime investigators a unique tool (IM 
writeprints) for analyzing IM-assisted cybercrimes.  It also provides an IM-specific 
stylometric feature set taxonomy robust enough to show separation between authors and 
between author categories.  This research demonstrated the effectiveness of creating IM 
author writeprints by evaluating various parameters in a systematic way.  Parameters 
such as the size of the suspect space, size of the IM conversation, and selected features 
are critical to the development of an author writeprint.  There are currently no known 
studies examining the impact of these parameters on IM authorship identification and 
characterization. 
Cybercrime investigators may leverage the techniques presented in this dissertation 
in conjunction with traditional forensics investigative techniques to aid in cybercrime 
decision support.  IM writeprints may be used in conjunction with other evidence, 
investigation techniques, and biometrics techniques to build or validate a criminal profile, 
reduce the potential suspect space to a certain subset of suspects; identify the most 
plausible author of an IM conversation from a group of suspects; link related crimes; 
develop an interview and interrogation strategy; and gather convincing digital evidence to 
justify search and seizure and provide probable cause.  By demonstrating high authorship 
identification and characterization probability, the research results presented in this 
 
181 
dissertation indicate a promising future for applying authorship analysis as an element of 
a multimodal biometrics system to assist with cyber forensics and cybercrime 
investigations.
