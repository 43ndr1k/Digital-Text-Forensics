Abstract
Current advances in shallow parsing allow us to use results from this field in stylogenetic research, so that a new methodology for the
automatic analysis of literary texts can be developed. The main pillars of this methodology - which is borrowed from topic detection
research - are (i) using more complex features than the simple lexical features suggested by traditional approaches, (ii) using authors or
groups of authors as a prediction class, and (iii) using clustering methods to indicate the differences and similarities between authors
(i.e. stylogenetics). On the basis of the stylistic genome of authors, we try to cluster them into closely related and meaningful groups.
We report on experiments with a literary corpus of five million words consisting of representative samples of female and male authors.
Combinations of syntactic, token-based and lexical features constitute a profile that characterizes the style of an author. The stylogenetics
methodology opens up new perspectives for literary analysis, enabling and necessitating close cooperation between literary scholars and
computational linguists.
1. Introduction
Recently, language technology has progressed to a state of
the art in which robust and fairly accurate linguistic anal-
ysis of lexical, morphological, and syntactic properties of
text has become feasible. This enables the systematic study
of the variation of these linguistic properties in texts by dif-
ferent authors (author identification) (Baayen et al., 1996;
Gamon, 2004), different time periods, different genres or
registers (Argamon et al., 2003), different regiolects, and
even different genders (Koppel et al., 2003; Kelih et al.,
2005).
We see this trend as potentially providing new tools and a
new methodology for the analysis of literary texts that has
traditionally focused on complex and deep markup (Mc-
Carty, 2003) and the statistical assesments of concordances
and word-count applications (Raben, 1965; Burrows, 1987;
Lancashire, 1993; Bucher-Gillmayr, 1996) for the analy-
sis of rhyme and sound patterns (Wisbey, 1971; Robey,
2000), the investigation of imagery and themes (Corns,
1982; Fortier, 1989; Fortier, 1996; Ide, 1986; Ide, 1989),
the structure of dramatic works (Potter, 1981; Potter, 1989;
Steele, 1991; Ilsemann, 1995), stylometrics and authorship
attribution (Hockey, 2000, 104-123), (Craig, 2004). See
(Rommel, 2004) for an overview of computational meth-
ods in literary studies. The methodology we propose is
borrowed from the text categorization literature (Sebastiani,
2002) where simple lexical features (called a bag of words)
are used to characterize a document with some topic class.
Statistical and information-theoretic methods are used to
select an informative bag of words to distinguish between
documents with different topics. Machine Learning meth-
ods are then used to learn to assign documents to one of the
predefined topics on the basis of examples. We generalize
this methodology in three ways:
• i. By extending the simple lexical features with more
complex features based on distributional syntactic in-
formation about part of speech tags, nominal and
verbal constituent patterns, as well as features rep-
resenting readability aspects (average word and sen-
tence length, type/token ratio etc.). The statistical
and information-theoretic methods can then be applied
to more complex features than individual words for
stylistic analysis.
• ii. By using individual authors or groups of authors as
classes to be predicted rather than topics. It can then
be investigated which features are predictive for author
identity, gender, time period etc. See (Koppel et al.,
2003) for work on this approach for gender prediction.
• iii. By using the vectors of complex features, com-
puted on a sufficiently large sample of the work of an
author as a signature for the style of that author and
using similarity-based clustering methods to develop
a stylogenetic analysis of differences and similarities
between authors, periods and genders. We define sty-
logenetics here as an approach to literary analysis that
groups authors on the basis of its stylistic genome into
family trees or closely related groups from some per-
spective.
Tree classification as a tool for the study of proximity and
distance between texts and authors has recently been ex-
plored by few studies which take the whole vocabulary of
the texts which are compared into consideration. (Julliard
and Luong, 1997; Julliard and Luong, 2001; Spencer et
al., 2003; Labbé and Labbé, to appear 2006). Central in
these studies, however, are not the complex features as pro-
posed in our methodology, but the lexical and lexicograph-
ical standardization of the vocabulary that is the qualitative
basis for proximity measurements between pairs of texts.
2. Corpus
In this paper we report on explorative stylogenetic work us-
ing a large corpus of literary works. From three online text
archives (viz. The Oxford Text Archive, the Electronic Text
Center of the University of Virginia and to a minor extent
Project Gutenberg) we collected representative samples of
100,000 words of 50 English and American authors, half
of them male, half of them female, from 12 time periods
between 1525 and 1925 (we worked with 25-year periods).
The appendix provides an overview of the authors, genders,
and periodization of the samples used (cf. Tables 1, 2).
3. Feature Extraction
Four types of features that have been applied as style mark-
ers can be distinguished: token-level features (e.g. word
length, readability), syntactic features (e.g. part-of-speech
tags, chunks), features based on vocabulary richness (e.g.
type-token ratio) and common word frequencies (e.g. of
function words) (Stamatatos et al., 2001). While most sty-
lometric studies are based on token-level features, word
forms and their frequencies of occurrence, syntactic fea-
tures have been proposed as more reliable style markers
since they are not under the conscious control of the au-
thor (Baayen et al., 1996; Diederich et al., 2000; Khmelev
and Tweedie, 2001; Kukushkina et al., 2001; Stamatatos et
al., 1999). Thanks to improvements in shallow text analy-
sis, we can extract syntactic features to test their relevance
in stylogenetic research.
In a first step, we developed an environment which enables
the automatic production of profiles of the samples in the
Stylogene corpus. A profile consists of a vector of 208 nu-
merical features representing automatically assigned infor-
mation about the following features:
• Type-token ratio: The type-token ratio V/N, V repre-
senting the size of the vocabulary of the sample, and
N the number of tokens, is a measure indicating the
vocabulary richness of an author.
• Word length: The distribution of words of different
lengths has been used as a feature in authorship attri-
bution studies (Diederich et al., 2000). Words with a
length of 15-19, 20-24 and 25+ were combined in sep-
arate categories.
• Readability: The readability feature is an implemen-
tation of the Flesch-Kincaid metric which indicates the
readability of a text, using mean word and sentence
length.
• Distribution of parts-of-speech: Syntax-based fea-
tures are not under the conscious control of the author
and therefore reliable style markers. Somers suggests
that
A more cultivated intellectual habit of think-
ing can increase the number of substantives
used, while a more dynamic empathy and
active attitude can be habitually expressed
by means of an increased number of verbs.
(Holmes, 1994, 89)
• Distribution of frequent function words: Traditional
approaches to stylometry research use content words
rather than function words, assuming that the latter oc-
cur to frequently to be of any relevance for style. Nev-
ertheless, function words (e.g. determiners, conjunc-
tions, prepositions) are not under the conscious control
of the author and therefore meaningful for stylogenetic
studies (Holmes, 1994, 90-91).
• Distribution of frequent chunks: Similarly to parts-
of-speech, chunks are also reliable features for sty-
logenetic research. We automatically extracted fre-
quencies of noun phrase, verb phrase, prepositional
phrase, adjectival phrase, adverbial phrase, conjunc-
tion, interjection, verb particle, subordinated clause
and preposition-noun phrase chunks.
• NP and VP chunk internal variation: The internal
organisation of NP and VP chunks is subject to varia-
tion, which can reveal the subconscious preference of
the author.
The resulting profiles can be used in applications like au-
thor or gender identification, but also in a stylogenetic anal-
ysis for the discovery of stylistic relationships between au-
thors that may not be evident on the basis of a more su-
perficial comparison. As a representation of contemporary
non-literary language, we added a profile based on 100,000
words of Wall Street Journal text.
In order to be able to extract these features automatically,
we used shallow parsing software developed in our lab
(Daelemans and van den Bosch, 2005) to automatically as-
sign parts of speech and constituent structure to the 51 x
100,000 word corpus. The pos tag set and chunk label set
used are those of the Penn Treebank project (Marcus et al.,
1993).
4. Cluster Analysis and Interpretation
The clustering method used is the one implemented in the
cluster program of Andreas Stolcke, which is an instance
of Euclidean distance based centroid clustering. Initially,
all data points are treated as clusters and the most similar
clusters are iteratively merged into larger clusters, building
up a hierarchical tree.
Figure 1 shows the family tree produced by applying hi-
erarchical clustering with Euclidean distance as similarity
metric to the full profiles of each author.
In further exploratory research, we used information-
theoretic analysis (i.e. Gain Ratio) of the relevance of each
feature in the profile in predicting the gender of the author
as a heuristic to select a new profile to cluster for gender-
related stylistic family trees. We selected the 43 features
that turned out to be the most relevant for characterizing
style differences between genders.
Figure 2 shows the family tree after feature selection in
which we find five groups of gender clusters.
The tree in Figure 1 shows that the Wall Street Journal
(WSJ) profile is clearly separated from the rest of the cor-
pus and that within the latter, Defoe, Hobbes, Mill, Behn,
and More are stylistic outliers. The interrelation between
genre and period may explain their distance from the rest
Figure 1: Family tree based on entire feature set
of the stylogene corpus. Hobbes, Behn, More and Defoe-as
a borderline case-are significantly earlier texts, whereas the
samples by Hobbes, Mill, and More all come from philo-
sophical essays. As an early female playwright, Behn is
also and understandably an outsider. Furthermore, cluster-
ing for gender seems to be quite successful. The family tree
presents itself naturally in two parts, the upper part of which
(from Defoe to Stoker) is predominantly populated by male
authors (21 out of 30 or a score of 70%) and the lower part
is strongly populated by female authors (16 out of 20 or a
score of 80%). Since up to the end of the Victorian period,
that is up to the beginning of the twentieth century, female
authors are generally observed to adopt the prevailing male
style of writing, the reason why four male authors (Kipling,
James, Trollope, and Hardy) appear in the female part of the
tree might be more interesting to study. In the second tree
that shows the family tree after feature selection we can dis-
tinguish five groups of gender clusters with 11 exceptions
(or 22%); six women writers (Stowe / Austin, Shelley / Fer-
ber, Porter, Behn) and five male authors (Defoe / Collins,
Trollope, James, Hardy). Aggregating the results from the
first tree with the results from the gender-related stylistic
family tree presented in Figure 2 reduces the initial female
gender problem from 9 to 3 cases (only A. Brontë, Canfield,
and, C. Brontë are correctly clustered within female groups
after feature selection) and the male gender problem from 4
to 3 (James, Trollope, and Hardy). However, this clustering
Figure 2: Family tree after feature selection on gender clus-
tering
introduced two new problematic names: Defoe and Collins
which, together with the remaining names, deserve further
research.
5. Conclusions and Further Research
Without claiming any relevance for these particular family
trees, it seems clear to us that specific literary style hypothe-
ses can be tested using similar approaches. Close cooper-
ation between literary scholars and computational linguists
is essential for this.
We have shown that robust text analysis can bring a new
set of tools to literary analysis. Specific hypotheses can be
tested and new insights can be gained by representing the
work (or different works) of authors as profiles and apply-
ing clustering and learning techniques to them. In future
work we will investigate more specific literary hypotheses,
and generalize the appoach to the analysis and comparison
of individual books of authors rather than random samples
of their work.
