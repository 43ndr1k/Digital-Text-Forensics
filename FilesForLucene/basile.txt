Stylometry
Stylometry = Quantitative Authorship Attribution = detection
of the author of a text by counting some “quantities” inside
the text itself.
The aim is to identify some indicator(s) of the style of an
author, usually by counting some linguistic, grammatical,
lexical or morphological quantities.

Italian politician, intellectual and journalist,
among the founders of the
Italian Communist Party.
He wrote thousands of articles for several newspapers
(L’Ordine Nuovo, Avanti!, ...), most of which he left unsigned.
The same did his colleagues and fellows: Amedeo Bordiga,
Palmiro Togliatti, Angelo Tasca...
Gramsci Project (Istituto Fondazione Gramsci, Rome):

A well-built A.A. corpus
Expected characteristics of a corpus for a true A.A. test:
1 homogeneous register, i.e. the genre of the texts and
the supporting media
2 homogeneous dialect, i.e. the cultural background of
the authors (language, readings...) and of their
audience
3 homogeneous time
Most data sets are not good... an example (Kešelj, 2003):
register Shakespeare (verse) vs. Emily Brönte (prose)
dialect Irving (American) vs. Dickens (English)
time Shakespeare (XVII c.) vs. Burroughs (XIX c.)

Why metrics?
Many different attribution methods use quantitative
measures inside texts and can therefore be treated
mathematically.
We chose similarity metrics mainly for three characteristics:
1 they are abstract: texts are “just” symbol sequences,
without any grammatical structure or distinction
between punctuation marks and letters;
2 they are general: can be used not only for texts, but for
almost any “thing” which can be coded as a string;
3 they can be mathematically motivated: behind the
methods lies a mathematical model which suggests that
these measures could be good indicators of similarity.

Authors as Markov sources
A very strong hypothesis:
suppose an author writes his texts choosing at each step a
new character according to some transition probabilities
depending only on the last n characters (the last n-gram) of
the generated sequence.
i.e. the author is a Markov source with finite memory n.
Let’s try with Charles Dickens’s Oliver Twist, David
Copperfield, Great Expectations and A Tale of Two Cities1,
a total of ∼ 4.5 millions characters.

Comments on results and doubts
Very good results: for the blind test, dn gave 90% Gramscian
and 100% non-Gramscian articles correctly attributed.
Some open questions about n-grams:
I why does it work? → many different informations
extracted from texts?
I why 8-grams? → low statistical significance, possible
confusion with topic...
The Project goes on:
hundreds of anonymous texts attributed (and hundreds to
come) and a good feedback from experts of Gramscian
work at the Fondazione.

Very good results: for the blind test, dn gave 90% Gramscian

A 6-equivalent of Wish you were here
So, so you think you can tell
heaven from hell, blue skies from pain,
can you tell a green field
from a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?
Did they get you to trade,
your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
a walk on part in the war,
for a lead role in a cage?
How I wish, how I wish you were here,
we’re just two lost soles swimming in a fish bowl,
year after year,
running over the same old ground,
but have we found the same old fears,
wish you were here.
