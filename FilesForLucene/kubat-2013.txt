ABSTRACT
This article deals with the one of the oldest and most traditional fields in quantitative linguis-
tics, the concept of vocabulary richness. Although there are several methods for vocabulary
richness measurement, all of them are influenced by text size. Therefore, the authors propose
a new way of vocabulary richness measurement without any text length dependence. In the
second part of the article, the new method is used for a genre analysis in texts written by
the Czech writer Karel Čapek. Furthermore, differences between authors and between
languages are studied with this method.
1. INTRODUCTION
Vocabulary richness measurement is one of the oldest and most traditional
fields in quantitative linguistics. The concept of vocabulary richness mea-
surement is based on the fact that each person uses a specific individual
vocabulary. Linguists use the concept of vocabulary richness mostly in
authorship and genre analysis. One of the oldest and easiest ways of vocab-
ulary richness measure is the type-token ratio (TTR). The TTR index is
based on the simple ratio between the number of types and tokens in a text.
The resulting value shows how much the vocabulary varies (the more
vocabulary variation in a text, the higher the TTR).
The stumbling block of TTR and all indices based on word frequency is
the fact that there is a dependence on text size. Although many attempts to
reduce this problem were proposed, no one was fully successful (most

notable in recent years R1 and Lambda structures proposed by Popescu
et al., 2009, 2011). Another disadvantage of indices measuring vocabulary
richness is the fact that the result is mostly only one figure, which can be
misleading. One of the most comprehensive books giving an overview in
this field is Word Frequency Studies (Popescu et al., 2009). Given that all
proposed formulas failed, it is necessary to find a new solution.
Since vocabulary richness is mostly used in stylometry, we analysed
genres in texts written by the Czech author Karel Čapek. We used a corpus
consisting of texts written by only one author to avoid a bias caused by dif-
ferent authors’ styles. The main aim of the analysis is to discover whether
we can distinguish genres using this feature. We follow up the work of
Marie Těšitelová who established the usage of statistical methods in Czech
linguistics and brought several studies in this field (e.g. Těšitelová, 1974,
1987).
This research has two aims. The first one is to propose a new way of
vocabulary richness measure without any text size dependence. The second
one is to discover whether vocabulary richness is an advisable criterion for
genre attribution.
2. DEFINITIONS
2.1 Moving Average Type-Token Ratio (MATTR)
Considering the dependence between the text length and plain type-token
ratio, Moving Average Type-Token Ratio (MATTR) was proposed by
Covington and McFall (2010, pp. 96–97). The definition is as follows
(freely quoted):
Consider a text consisting of words w1 to wn and a number L arbitrarily
chosen where L < N, where N denotes the length of the given text in terms
of running words.
For each i; i 2 N, i < N–L, iterate following two steps:
(1) Select the text passage wi to wi+L.
(2) Count the number of types (Vi) in the passage.
The average type token ration MATTR(L) is defined as:
MATTRðLÞ ¼
PNL
i¼1 Vi
LðN  LÞ :

The main disadvantage of the MATTR is that it produces only one figure
(e.g. the novel Krakatit written by Karel Čapek has MATTR(100) = 0.78),
which may result in misleading interpretations when comparing the measure
of one text with another one.
The idea of a moving window is not new; it is implemented in the soft-
ware WordSmith (Scott, 2013) as the standardized type-token ratio (STTR)
where the average TTR is based on consecutive word chunks of a text;
STTR is based on non-overlapping windows whereas MATTR uses
smoothly moving window.
2.2 Moving Window Type-Token Ratio (MWTTR)
Moving Window Type-Token Ratio can be defined as the series of Vi (or by
another words, each Vi is mapped to its i). An example follows:
The MWTTR has been proposed by Köhler and Galle (1993) (although
not called MWTTR) and it was used also by Covington and McFall (2010,
p. 98) (albeit not defined nor called MWTTR).
2.3 Moving Window Type-Token Ratio Distribution (MWTTRD)
The MWTTR is suitable to study changes of the TTR value within one text,
but is not appropriate to study the TTR of the text as a whole. Thus we
propose Moving Window Type-Token Ratio Distribution – the distribution

of MWTTR values. By terms of the previous subsections: to each
aj; j 2 N ; j  L map the number of the iterations in which Vi = j.
The usage of the method is illustrated in the following chart:
In Figures 1 and 2 can be seen that MWTTR focuses on a development
in a text whereas our measurement considers a text as a whole.
The method was implemented in the MaWaTaTaRaD freeware.1
3. METHODOLOGY
The word-forms are used as units for all calculations in this research. Thus,
no text was lemmatized. The main reason for this decision lies in the fact
that there is not general consensus how to lemmatize text and the word-
form segmentation is thus less ambiguous. Moreover, this method allows
comparing results obtained from analyses in different languages.
The cornerstone of every quantitative analysis is an appropriate sample.
Given that we aim to discover possible differences between genres, the
sample contains texts written by only one author. This method secures
results from negative influence of different authors’ styles. We chose texts
written by the Czech author Karel Čapek who wrote many texts in several

genres. We matched up his texts with seven genres (travel book, novel,
short story, children’s literature, correspondence, scientific text, poem).
MWTTRD(100) was computed for the mentioned texts and the results
were compared. In this research, we chose L = 100 for all calculations.
4. RESULTS
The resulting values of each genre can be seen in Figure 3.
Although the curves seem to be very similar, we must discover the dif-
ferences between the curves in a more proper way. We decided to use the
so-called x2 discrepancy coefficient (C) (see Mačutek & Wimmer, 2013)
which is usually used for the measurement of goodness of fit. We consider
value C = 0.05 to be a limit for the decision whether two distributions are
similar or not (the lower C, the more similar distributions are). The results
of the discrepancy coefficient can be seen in Table 1.
Considering the results in Table 1, we can say that TTR is not a very
suitable tool for distinguishing differences between genres. Nevertheless, we
discovered the extraordinary position of children’s literature between genres.
This genre differs from four of six other ones. We assume that this fact is
caused by the need for a limited vocabulary due to readability for children.

Although one can expect also an extraordinary position of poems, the
results reject such expectations.
Since vocabulary richness seems to be not very powerful for genre anal-
ysis, one can ask whether we can use the measurement for authorship attri-
bution. Therefore, we compared eight Czech authors (namely Čapek,
Jirásek, Čelakovský, Havlíček, Erben, Březina, Čech, Vančura) using the
same method. The corpora consist of more than 60 books. The curves of
the TTR distributions can be seen in Figure 4.

At first sight, the differences between the authors in Figure 4 seem to be
greater than between the genres in Figure 3. The results of the discrepancy
coefficient are shown in Table 2.
According to the discrepancy coefficient values in Table 2, it is evident
that vocabulary richness is a quite appropriate feature for authorship analy-
sis. For a better clarity, Figure 5 shows a network where the authors with
similar MWTTRD are connected.
Based on the results in Table 2 and Figure 5, we can state that three
authors (Čelakovský, Erben, Březina) have an extraordinary position
between the eight analysed writers. Březina’s poetry belongs to symbolism,
his writing is full of metaphors, philosophical and scientific terms. There-
fore, his poems aimed to a small circle of intellectual readers. In contrast to
Březina, Čelakovský and Erben wrote folk poetry based on oral texts. The
style of these texts is simple and is connected to less vocabulary richness.

Although one can expect the extraordinary position of these writers, it is
quite surprising that Březina does not differ from Erben. Considering the
aforementioned short literary background, we can state that TTR measure-
ment is a more or less suitable method for authorship analysis.
Since we applied the new method of vocabulary richness measure to
genre and authorship analysis, it is logical to ask whether the measurement
can be used for distinguishing languages. Therefore, we created a corpus
consisting of eight languages with different typology (namely Czech,

German, Italian, Hungarian, Arabic, Tagalog, English and Basque). To
obtain comparable results, each language is represented by 10 long prosaic
texts. The results are displayed in Figure 6.
The results of the discrepancy coefficient can be seen in Table 3:
The discrepancy coefficient values in Table 3 are high, when comparing
to the previous ones. The languages are similar only in five of 28 cases. It
is interesting that in Figure 6 distances between languages seem to be corre-
lated with geographical location rather than with the typological differences.
Given that this research is not primarily aimed to language analysis, we will
not deal with this issue in detail. Nevertheless, it could be a remarkable
observation for future language researches. In our context, it is primarily
important that we can consider MWTTRD to be a very powerful tool for
language analysis.
5. CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION
This work consists of two main parts, the first one is the new method of
vocabulary richness measurement, the second one is genre analysis based
on the proposed method.
We proposed this new method of vocabulary measurement (Moving
Window Type-Token Ratio Distribution; MWTTRD) which is independent
on text length. In contrast to other methods, we consider the entire distribu-
tion in the measurement. Therefore our method can be used for the analysis
of texts with different lengths and the results are not limited by only one
resulting value.
The research also brought several important observations. Vocabulary
richness measurement seems to be a not very efficient tool for genre
analysis. We discovered that only one genre (children’s literature) has an
extraordinary position. This genre differs from four of six other ones. On
the other hand, we analysed only texts written by one Czech author, there-
fore it is necessary to analyse more texts from other authors and languages.
According to our results in authorship analysis, we consider vocabulary
richness to be a matter of authorship rather than genre. However, the best
results were obtained in language analysis where almost all languages were
mutually different.
Finally, it must be said that this work is just a first attempt to discover
whether vocabulary richness is a suitable feature for genre analysis.

Therefore, it is necessary to analyse more texts to support or reject our
preliminary claims.
