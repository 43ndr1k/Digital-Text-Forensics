Abstract
Along with its methodological development, authorship analysis has expanded in
scope to new application areas like authorship profiling and computational
sociolinguistics as well as conventional ones like authorship attribution. For
these new applications, providing a new interpretation of text through the textual
characteristics is as important as improving the classification performance be-
tween the authors, which was the aim in conventional applications. Lexical in-
dicators were one of the most frequently used characteristics in conventional
applications as they were effective at discriminating between authors, but most
of the previously used indicators were based on the frequencies of morphemes,
and reflected only limited aspects of the writing styles of the authors. In order to
use these types of characteristics for new applications, we need to develop indi-
cators reflecting other various aspects of the authors writing styles that are useful
for interpretation as well as classification. As such, we propose the use of two
types of co-occurrence-based indicators, namely network indicators and a
co-occurrence-based concentration indicator in this field. Experimental results
using the Aozora Bunko corpora, along with qualitative analyses, showed that our
indicators were very effective at capturing aspects of the styles of the authors as
well as for improving the classification performance. We concluded that our
indicators successfully supplement previously used indicators and are useful for
various new applications in authorship analysis.

1 Introduction
Authorship analysis is a subfield of computational
stylistics as well as genre or chronology detection. It
includes authorship attribution or authorship char-
acterization as its subfields (Zheng et al., 2006).
Along with the methodological developments
made in natural language processing, and the pro-
duction of a wide variety of available texts, it has
expanded in scope to new application areas like
authorship profiling and computational sociolin-
guistics (Argamon et al., 2007; Suzuki, 2009).
These new application areas aim to infer the au-
thor’s personal or socio-cultural profiles based on
their writing styles, whereas the conventional areas
like authorship attribution aim at discriminating
between authors (Zheng et al., 2006; Argamon
et al., 2007; Estival et al., 2007).
For conventional applications, identifying the
characteristics that are effective enough for discri-
minating between authors has been one of the most
important goals, and many textual characteristics
have been proposed for this purpose. Among
them, lexical indicators have frequently been used
as they reflected the information on the frequencies
of morphemes, and thus were effective for improv-
ing the discriminant power between authors.
It is certain that these types of information are
important for authorship analysis, but at the same
time they reflected the limited aspects of the writing
styles of the authors. For new applications, as they
emphasize the interpretation of texts through the
textual characteristics as well as the discrimination
between authors (Suzuki, 2009), we need to develop
new indicators that reflect other aspects concerning
the authors writing styles.
As such, this study proposes the use of two types
of indicators that are based on the co-occurrent
combinations between morphemes, namely network
indicators and a co-occurrent-based concentration
indicator for the authorship analysis. We extract the
co-occurrent combinations between morphemes in
a sentence to create these two types of indicators, so
that these indicators can shed light on the informa-
tion concerning the relation between morphemes as
well as some information on the syntax (or sen-
tence); these types of characteristics are currently
attracting the growing attention of scholars in
related fields (Miyake and Joyce, 2007; Akama
et al., 2008; Luyckx and Daelemans, 2008). These
two different types of indicators are based on the
co-occurrent combinations between morphemes,
but have different emphatic points; network indica-
tors reflect the global structure of the co-occurrence
graph, and reflect the structural alignment of the
morphemes in the texts, focusing more on the rela-
tion itself instead of the frequencies, while a
co-occurrence-based concentration indicator is an
extension of a concentration indicator, and focuses
more on the frequencies.1 They should supplement
the conventional lexical indicators based on the fre-
quencies of morphemes, and should shed light on
aspects of the writing styles of the authors.
It should be noted that we deliberately examine
the meaning of these indicators, i.e. what textual
information these indicators use, by qualitatively
analyzing the texts as well as comparing the im-
proved performance of these indicators to several
patterns within the experiments. In addition, the
dependency of these indicators on the sample size,
number of sentences, and sentence lengths is re-
spectively related to their discriminant power
(Tweedie and Baayen, 1998; Yoshikane, 2000), and
we should focus part of our discussion on this
matter. We use the random forests classifier for
comparing the importance between indicators,
which has rarely been used but best suits our pur-
poses. This study contributes to many new applica-
tions in authorship analysis, by proposing the
indicators reflecting these aspects of the writing
styles of the authors.
The rest of this article is organized as follows. In
Section 2, we review the previous work, and in
Section 3, we explain the characteristics we use
in this study including our proposed indicators. In
Section 4, we outline our experimental setup, and
we discuss the results in Section 5. Finally, we make
our concluding remarks in Section 6.

There have been many studies in the field of author-
ship analysis. Grieve (2007), Koppel et al. (2009),

and Stamatatos (2009b) systematically reviewed this
field including methods and characteristics for this
task. In Japanese, Jin and Murakami (2003) re-
viewed this field and Jin and Murakami (2007)
showed the most current results. Levitan and
Argamon (2006), Miranda Garcı̀a and Calle
Martı̀n (2007), and Zheng et al. (2006) discussed
the effectiveness of functions words in authorship
attribution studies. Koppel et al. (2006) proposed a
method to calculate the stability of words to judge
them whether they were effective for authorship at-
tribution. Luyckx and Daelemans (2008) proposed
to use the syntactic characteristics for authorship
attribution. As well as these authorship attribution
studies, there are various new applications in
authorship analysis. Estival et al. (2007) clearly men-
tioned the difference between authorship attribu-
tion and authorship profiling and proposed
methods for authorship profiling of English
emails. Panicheva et al. (2010a) analyzed the ‘per-
sonal sense’ of blogpost using the information on
co-occurrent distribution and Panicheva et al.
(2010b) tried to combine authorship attribution
with opinion mining. Argamon et al. (2009) inves-
tigated the differences of writing styles on gender,
age, and personality and Argamon et al. (2007) pro-
posed computational sociolinguistics as a poten-
tially important area in computational stylistics,
and Suzuki (2009) provided an important example
of computational sociolinguistics using Japanese
political texts. Another new application area in
this field is intrinsic plagiarism detection, where
the detection of plagiarized fragments is based on
changes in the writing styles. Potthast et al. (2010b)
surveyed a series of benchmark workshop on pla-
giarism detection (Potthast et al., 2009, 2010a)
including intrinsic plagiarism detection, and pre-
sented an evaluation framework. Stamatatos
(2009a) proposed character n-gram profiles as fea-
tures for the subtask of intrinsic plagiarism detec-
tion. Our indicators would be useful for these new
applications of authorship analysis.
Many other studies have proposed various lexical
indicators (Yule, 1944; Good, 1953; Guiraud, 1954;
Herdan, 1960; Maas, 1972; Sichel, 1975; Tuldava,
1977; Brunet, 1978; Dugast, 1979; Honoré, 1979).
Among them, Simpson (Simpson, 1949) proposed
the concentration indicator D. We use D for com-
parison with our indicators, and thus we will ex-
plain the definition of D in Section 3. Tweedie
and Baayen (1998) have systematically examined
these indicators, and showed that all of them,
except D and its variations, were dependent on the
sample size. These indicators including D were ba-
sically based on the frequencies of morphemes. This
study proposes the use of new indicators based on
co-occurrent combinations between morphemes,
and sheds light on aspects of the textual character-
istics of the authors.
The textual information contained in
co-occurrent combinations between morphemes has
been used for other natural language processing tasks
such as keyword extraction (Hisamitsu et al., 2000;
Matsuo and Ishizuka, 2002), clustering (Matsuo
et al., 2006), and some studies formed networks
from co-occurrent combinations for representing se-
mantic networks (Miyake, 2006; Miyake and Joyce,
2007; Akama et al., 2008). Kageura (2008) and
Asaishi and Kageura (2011) compiled networks
from common constituent elements of terms in
order to analyze the motivatedness structure of
Japanese terminologies. Hoover (2003b) first pro-
posed to use co-occurrent combinations for author-
ship attribution, though he calculated the
co-occurrences in n word window in English to ana-
lyze the uses of collocations by the author. N-gram is
a state-of-the-art features using co-occurrent com-
binations (Grieve, 2007; Koppel et al., 2009;
Stamatatos, 2009b), but other types of co-occurrent
features as such as those we propose in this article
have rarely been used in the field of authorship ana-
lysis. In this study we calculate the co-occurrent com-
binations in a sentence in Japanese, and show that it
reflects the aspects of the textual characteristics.
3 Characteristics
In this section, we explain four kinds of character-
istics we use in this study: (i) frequency of mor-
phemes; (ii) basic indicators; (iii) network
indicators; and (iv) co-occurrence-based indica-
tors.2 Of these characteristics, (i) is one of the sim-
plest and most basic characteristics in authorship

analysis (Stamatatos, 2009b); (ii) are the conven-
tional lexical indicators based on the frequencies
of the morphemes; and (iii) and (iv) are our pro-
posed indicators which are based on the
co-occurrent combinations between the mor-
phemes. The difference between (iii) and (iv) is
that (iii) takes in the global structure on
co-occurrence graphs (Newman, 2003), whereas
(iv) neglects this point, but emphasizes more on
the frequencies of the co-occurrent combinations.
3.1 Frequencies of morphemes
We used a bag of words model using the relative
frequencies of uni-gram morphemes for setting up
the experimental baseline, and we increased the
number of morphemes from the most frequent
one to 100 morphemes.3 A bag of words clearly re-
flected the textual information of the frequencies of
morphemes, and our indicators were based on all
the morphemes as well, thus it is better for our
baseline than other more complicated language
models.4
3.2 Basic indicators
We used Simpson’s concentration indicator D
(Simpson, 1949) as a conventional indicator based
on the frequency spectrum, i.e. the frequencies of all
the morphemes, which is formalized as follows:
D ¼
XN
m¼1
V ðm;N Þm
N
m 1
N  1 ;
where N represents the number of tokens, i.e. the
number of morphemes appearing in texts, V(N)
represents the number of types, i.e. the number of
different morphemes appearing in texts, and V(m,
N) represents the number of types appearing m
times in texts. D is an indicator that is strongly af-
fected by the frequencies of frequent morphemes
(Kageura, 2000). D is an unbiased estimator of
C2,0, where Cm,n are population parameters intro-
duced by Good (Good, 1953), the definition of
which is as follows.
Cm;n ¼
X
ei2S
pmi ð log piÞ
n;
where S is the set of all events ei and pi is a prob-
ability assigned to each event ei,
5 and when N!1,
D converges to C2,0 (Good, 1953; Kageura, 2000).
D is also independent of N (Kageura, 2000;
Tweedie and Baayen, 1998), and is effective for dis-
criminating between the authors of texts (Jin and
Murakami, 2003; Hoover, 2003a; Grieve, 2007;
Miranda Garcı̀a and Calle Martı̀n, 2007). We also
used N, V(N), a type-token ratio (TTR¼V(N))/N),
and the growth rate (GR¼V(1, N)/N) in our
experiments.6
3.3 Network indicators
Furthermore, in the pioneering studies by Barabási
and Albert (1999) and Watts and Strogatz (1998),
the network sciences have shown that many actual
networks have possess ‘small-world’ and ‘scale-free’
characteristics. This means that any two nodes in
the actual network can be connected by a rather
small number of steps (intermediate nodes) and
the degree distribution in the actual network follows
a power law. These two important characteristics of
networks can be measured by two basic network
indicators, namely the average path length (L) and
clustering coefficient (C). Thus, we selected them
among other various network indicators as the
basic ones for our analyses. For co-occurrence
graphs, they should reflect the structural alignment
of the morphemes in the texts. They are respectively
formalized as follows:
L ¼
P
dðu; vÞ
VeðVe  1Þ=2 ;
C ¼ 1
Ve
XVe
i¼1
Ci;
where
Ci ¼
2Cli
EiðEi  1Þ
;
Ve represents the number of nodes, d(u, v) repre-
sents the minimum distance between two nodes, Ei
represents the number of edges for the vertex i, and
Cli represents the number of clusters for vertex i, i.e.
triangles including i and other two nodes, which are
connected with edges each other. L represents
whether the two nodes in a graph are distant or
not, and C, mean values of Ci for all the nodes,
represents whether the nodes in a graph are tightly

clustered or not. For a co-occurrence graph, L
should reflect both the variety of morphemes and
the complicatedness of the sentences. If an author
uses similar morphemes in different sentences (or
situations), L will be low, and if they use different
morphemes in them, L will be high. In addition, if
they use complicated sentences, L will be low, and if
they use simple sentences, L will be high. C is the
mean value of Ci for all the morphemes in the texts,
and it should reflect the author’s preferences for
ambiguous or unambiguous morphemes and fre-
quent or infrequent morphemes. According to
Dorow et al. (2005),7 Ci measures whether neigh-
bors of a morpheme are neighbors of each other,
and thus unambiguous morphemes, like the days of
the week, have high Cis because they are usually
found in small, semantically very cohesive commu-
nities that contain a number of clusters, while am-
biguous morphemes, like ‘bank’, have low Cis
because they are connected with different commu-
nities of morphemes. Moreover, according to
Miyake (Miyake, 2006), function words have high
Cis because they appear very frequently, and thus
have a high Ei(Ei 1), but appear with various
types of words, and thus do not have a high Cli.
Taking the discussion of the work into consider-
ation, we can see that infrequent morphemes
would have a low Ci, because they have a high
Ei(Ei 1), and a hapax legomena should have
Ci¼ 1 by definition, because they appear once in
the texts and we connected all the co-occurrences
in the sentences as edges, and that means all the
neighbors of a hapax legomena are connected with
each other to make a cluster. Ci can also be used for
detecting special hidden (infrequent, but important)
keywords from the texts (Akama et al., 2007). By
using these indicators, we can understand the struc-
tural alignment of morphemes and this will shed
light on the stylistic character of the authors regard-
ing their sentence structures as well as lexical
choices. We used Ve, and the number of edges (E)
in our experiments for comparison.
3.4 Co-occurrence-based indicators
Finally, we used a new indicator of co-
occurrence-based concentration (CoD), which was
formalized as follows:
CoD ¼
XCoN
w¼1
V ðw;CoN Þ w
CoN
w  1
CoN  1 ;
where w represents the weight of edges, CoN repre-
sents the number of co-occurrent combinations ap-
pearing in texts (equals the sum of the weight of
edges w), V(CoN) represents the number of differ-
ent co-occurrent combinations appearing in texts
(equals E), and V(w, CoN) represents the number
of different co-occurrent combinations appearing w
times (equals the number of edges with weight w).
This indicator is an extension of Simpson’s D
to co-occurrent combinations, and emphasizes the
information on the frequencies of the frequent
co-occurrent combinations. As we extract the
co-occurrent combinations in a sentence, this indi-
cator should reflect some information on the syntax
as well as the relations between morphemes. This
indicator shows an important characteristic of D,
namely the sample size independency. We used
CoN, V(CoN), the type-token ratio of co-occurrent
combinations (CoTTR¼V(CoN)/CoN), and the
growth rate of co-occurrent combinations
(CoGR¼V(1, CoN)/CoN) in our experiments for
comparison.
4 Experimental Setup
In this section, we explain the data, methods, ex-
perimental designs, and evaluation methods we
used.
4.1 Data
We downloaded 200 texts by 10 Japanese novelists
(20 texts per novelist) from the Aozora Bunko cor-
pora8 on 29 August 2008. The texts were written by
Akutagawa, Kikuchi, Natsume, Mori, Shimazaki,
Izumi, Okamoto, Umino, Sasaki, and Dazai, and
the criteria of text selection were basically based
on a previous study (Jin and Murakami, 2007),
which aimed at collecting a standard data set for
authorship attribution in Japanese. The texts were
written in the same eras (from the end of the 19th
century to the beginning of the 21st century), and
genres and other possible factors affecting the styles

of authors were carefully controlled. We removed
the headers, footers, readings, explanations, titles,
chapter and section titles, and quotes, and then car-
ried out morphological analysis using MeCab.9
Table 1 lists the basic data on the corpora. We ex-
tracted the co-occurrent combinations between mor-
phemes in each sentence and made a co-occurrence
graph for every text in which a morpheme is a node
and a co-occurrent relation is an edge.
4.2 Machine-learning methods
We used the random forests classifier proposed by
Breiman (Breiman, 2001) as our classification
method. Random forests is an improved way of
bagging (Breiman, 1996), an ensemble-learning
method. The basic idea of ensemble learning is to
improve the classification performance of previous
statistical methods, i.e. decision trees in these cases,
by repeatedly performing the experiments and cal-
culating the mean or majority votes on the results.
However, the results will always be the same when
using exactly the same data to perform these experi-
ments, thus ensemble-learning methods including
bagging usually use bootstrap samplings from the
original data to repeat the experiments. The main
improvement in random forests from bagging is the
extraction of a random subset from each bootstrap-
ping sample, that enlarges the variances in boot-
strapping samples (Breiman, 2001; Jin, 2007).
We first sampled from i cases at random from
the original text-feature matrix Mi,j with replace-
ments to make a bootstrap sample, and we extracted
random subsets of
ffiffi
j
p
variables from a bootstrap
sample to make a sample for constructing an un-
pruned decision tree. For splitting the nodes, we
used the Gini index formalized as follows:
QðT Þ ¼
XK
k¼1
pkð1 pkÞ;
where pk represents the proportion of data points
in region R assigned to class k (k¼ 1, . . . , K), and
this vanishes for pk¼ 0 and pk¼ 1 and has a max-
imum at pk¼ 0.5 (Bishop, 2006). These sampling,
extraction, and tree-constructing processes are re-
peated 1,000 times, and we construct a new classi-
fier by a majority vote of the set of trees. When the
training set for the current tree was drawn by sam-
pling with replacement, one-third of the cases were
left out of the sample. This is called the out-of-bag
(OOB) data, and used to get a running unbiased
estimate of the classification error as trees
are added to the forest. It is also used to get esti-
mates of variable importance (Breiman and Cutler,
2004).
An important characteristic of random forests
is that it returns variable importance (VIacu) for
classification experiments. For calculating variable
importance, we first put down the out-of-bag
cases and count the number of votes cast for
the correct class, and second we randomly per-
mute the values of the variable m in the
out-of-bag cases, and put these cases down
the tree. We subtract the number of votes for
the correct class in the variable-m-permuted
out-of-bag data from the number of votes for
the correct class in the original, untouched
out-of-bag data. We calculate the average of this
number over all trees in the forest, and that
number is the raw importance score for variable
m. Finally, we divide the raw score by the stand-
ard error of the valuable in the calculation over all
the trees, and that number is VIacu for variable m
(Breiman, 2001; Breiman and Cutler, 2004). The
VIacu represents the degree to which a class loses
its specific character when one type of morpheme
changes into another type of morpheme. This
method has advantages for our task, as our pur-
pose is to compare the contributions of the indi-
cators, rather than achieving the best performance.
This method calculates important variables directly
contributing to the classification in the experi-
ment; thus, it best suits our purposes.
4.3 Experimental design
We used a bag of words model using the relative
frequencies of uni-gram morphemes as the baseline
(Exp1). We increased the number of morphemes

from the most frequent one to 100 morphemes. We
added previously used basic indicators to this base-
line (Exp2), and our proposed indicators to them
(Exp3), thus we performed three kinds of experi-
ments, annotated as follows:
Exp1. bag of words (baseline);
Exp2. bag of wordsþ basic indicators (D, N,
V(N), TTR, GR);
Exp3. bag of words þ basic indicators þ
network indicators (L, C, Ve, E) þ co-occur-
rence-based indicators (CoD, CoN, V(CoN),
CoTTR, CoGR).
We added the indicators to the baseline because
it is more usual instead of using them alone
for authorship analysis (Koppel et al., 2009). We
confirmed the improved performances of each in-
dicator and examined what types of information
these indicators use by comparing the perform-
ances by increasing the number of morphemes
in the baseline. In addition, we did not add any
other characteristics like sentence length, charac-
ter-based characteristics, etc. and deliberately
observed the improved performance of these indi-
cators because it forced us to examine these points
more clearly.
4.4 Evaluation
We used OOB tests implemented in random for-
ests, which can be used in substitution of n-fold
cross-validation (Breiman, 2001; Breiman and
Cutler, 2004). In random forests, each tree is
constructed using a different bootstrap sample
from the original data, and one-third of the
cases were left out of the bootstrap sample and
not used in the construction of the n-th tree.
Then, put each case left out in the construction
of the k-th tree down the k-th tree to get a clas-
sification, and in this way, a test set classification
is obtained for each case in one-third of the trees.
At the end of the run, take j to be the class that
got most of the votes, and we obtained the con-
fusion matrix. Using the confusion matrix, we
calculated the macro average of the Fi,1 values.
Precision (Pi), recall rates (Ri), macro average of
precisions ( P), macro average of recall rates ( R),
Fi, values, and macro average of Fi, values ( F)
are defined as follows.

where ai, bi, ci, and di are the number of texts clas-
sified as in Table 2. Pi and P measure the proportion
of the texts that are relevant in the set of all texts
classified, and Ri and R measure the proportion of
the texts that are correctly identified as such among
all relevant texts. Fi, and F indicates the summary
statistics of Pi and Ri (Tokunaga, 1999; Jin and
Murakami, 2006).
We applied Wilcoxon rank-sum tests to confirm
whether there are significant differences between the
median F1 values given Exp1 and Exp2, and Exp1
and Exp3. We applied these tests using the values
given the experiments using (i) the most frequent
one to 100 morphemes, and (ii) using the most fre-
quent 20–100 morphemes. As we will show in the
Section 5, we tested (ii) because Exp3 gave better
performance than Exp1 in the period. It should be
noted that we did not apply these types of tests to
prove the robustness of our method for improving
the classification performances, but we applied them
for supporting the discussion, investigating the
meaning of our indicators.

Random forests use random numbers in the ex-
periments, thus we performed the experiments 100
times, and calculated the mean F1 values for these
100 experiments (Jin and Murakami, 2007). We
compared the performances for three types of ex-
periments, and compared the contribution of our
proposed indicators to the classification (shown as
VIacu in random forests). As well as these quantita-
tive evaluations, we also qualitatively evaluated the
results; we discussed what types of textual informa-
tion these indicators used by examining the actual
texts with special values for these indicators.
5 Results and Discussion
In this section, we first observe correlations between
indicators in order to examine the sample size de-
pendency of the indicators, and then show the re-
sults regarding the experimental performance and
variable importance. Then, we proceed to compare
the two experiments (Exp2 and Exp3) and discuss
the results using qualitative analysis of the indica-
tors followed by a quantitative analysis.
5.1 Basic observations
First, we show the results of basic observations of
the indicators with regard to their sample size de-
pendency. Sample size dependency is an undesirable
character of these indicators for discriminating be-
tween authors (Tweedie and Baayen, 1998;
Yoshikane, 2000). Figure 1 represents the relation
between the number of tokens (N) and the concen-
tration indicator (D), the number of nodes (Ve) and
the number of edges (E), Ve and the average path
length (L), Ve and the clustering coefficient (C), and
the number of co-occurrent combinations (CoN)
and the co-occurrence-based concentration indica-
tor (CoD), using logarithm scale. The value of each
text is plotted by author’s initial þ text number.
Table 3 represents the Spearman’s rank correlation
coefficients () between these indicators. The table
shows the strong positive correlation between Ve
and E, the rather strong positive correlation between
Ve and L, and the rather strong negative correlation
between Ve and C, while showing few correlations
between N and D, and a weak negative correlation
between CoN and CoD.
Second, we show the results of basic observations
of the indicators with regard to their characteristics
on sentences, as our proposed indicators are based
on co-occurrent combinations between morphemes
in a sentence. Dependency on the number of sen-
tences (NoS) is an undesirable character as well as
on the sample size, but dependency on sentence
length is not necessarily an undesirable character
as sentence length can be effective for authorship
discrimination (Suzuki and Kageura, 2008).
Figure 2 represents the relation between the
number of sentences (NoS) and L, C, CoD, and
the mean length of sentences (LoS) and L, C, CoD,
using logarithm scale. Table 4 represents the
Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient () between
these indicators. The table shows the strong positive
correlation between NoS and L, and the strong nega-
tive correlation between NoS and C, while a weak
positive correlation between NoS and CoD, and the
rather strong negative correlation between LoS and
CoD.
5.2 Experimental performance
Figure 3 shows the transitions in the macro average
of F1 values when the number of morphemes in the
baseline increases from the most frequent one to 100
morphemes, regarding Exp1, Exp2, and Exp3.10 We
applied Wilcoxon rank-sum test to confirm the sig-
nificant difference between Exp1 and Exp3, and
Exp2 and Exp3 (using the most frequent one to
100 morphemes, and using the most frequent 20
to 100 morphemes).11 The P-values were 0.1172
(Exp1 versus Exp2), 0.0068 (Exp1 versus Exp3),
0.1199 (Exp2 versus Exp3) respectively, when
using the most frequent one to 100 morphemes,
and 0.0201 (Exp1 versus Exp2), 0.0001 (Exp1
versus Exp3), 0.0310 (Exp2 versus Exp3) respect-
ively, when using the most frequent 20–100 mor-
phemes. The results showed that Exp3 gave
significantly better performance than Exp1
(P < 0.01) (both cases), and than Exp2 (P < 0.05)
(using the most frequent 20 to 100 morphemes),
while there was not significant difference
(P¼ 0.12) between Exp2 and Exp3 using the most
frequent one to 100 morphemes.

The results are summarized as follows: (i) Exp3
was basically superior to Exp1 and Exp2; (ii) when
the number of morphemes in the baseline was small,
Exp2 was superior to Exp3; and (iii) Exp3 gave the
best and stable performance with more than 43
morphemes, and gave the best performance with
the most frequent 81 morphemes (F1¼ 96.74).
The results show that our indicators, namely net-
work indicators and the co-occurrence-based con-
centration indicator, as well as previously used basic
indicators, improve the performance. Although the
improvement itself is rather minimal as opposed to
the discriminant power of baseline, from the results,
we can confirm that these kinds of indicators rep-
resent different types of textual information. This
implies that the proper use of these indicators will
be effective for interpreting the author’s texts.
5.3 Variable importance
Table 5 shows the variable importance (VIacu) of
Exp2 and Exp3 with the most frequent 10 mor-
phemes (when Exp2 shows the best performance)
and the most frequent 100 morphemes (when
Exp3 shows the best performance).
The results are summarized as follows: (i) D has
high VIacu among the basic indicators (both Exp2
and Exp3); (ii) regarding the experiments using the
most frequent 10 morphemes, a relatively large dif-
ference in VIacu of D is found between Exp2 and
Exp3 (rank 4; value 5.278 versus rank 8; value
3.203), while a relatively small difference is found
between them regarding those using the most fre-
quent 100 morphemes (rank 16; value 1.260 versus
rank 18; value 1.033); (iii) L and C have relatively
high VIacu among the network indicators (Exp3);
and (iv) CoD has especially high VIacu for all indi-
cators, which means it is important for discriminat-
ing between authors (Exp3).
The results confirm the importance of D for
authorship discrimination. D is an indicator
that is independent of the sample size, namely
N (Tweedie and Baayen, 1998; Kageura, 2000;
Yoshikane, 2000), a point that is also shown
in our basic observations in Section 5.1. Further-
more, this indicator is also independent of the
number of sentences.
Second, the results show that the proposed indi-
cator CoD is especially important for authorship
discrimination. CoD is an extension of D, and
thus analytically independent of the sample size,
namely CoN. Moreover, this indicator provides in-
formation on co-occurrent combinations between
morphemes. The results indicate that this indicator
is very powerful for discriminating between authors
of the texts.
The results also indicate that network indicators
L and C are useful for authorship discrimination to
some extent, but not so effective when compared to
CoD. This is because these indicators are rather
strongly dependent on the sample size, namely Ve,
whereas CoD was constant compared to the CoN.12
5.4 Comparison between Exp2 and Exp3
Regarding the experiments using the most frequent
ten morphemes, Exp2 performed better than Exp3.
This was likely caused by the differences in the VIacu
of D. In the experiments with the most frequent ten
morphemes, it was important to obtain information
on the frequencies of rather frequent morphemes,
namely those in the eleventh place or lower in this
case. D is an indicator that uses a great deal of in-
formation on the frequencies of frequent mor-
phemes (Tweedie and Baayen, 1998, Kageura,
2000), and is able to use the information on these
rather frequent morphemes. Exp2 used only the
basic indicators, and for that reason, provided a
high VIacu to D. In this way, it successfully provided
information on the frequencies of rather frequent
morphemes for classification, and thus performed
better than Exp3. On the other hand, Exp3 used
network indicators and co-occurrence-based indica-
tors as well as the basic indicators, and for that
reason, Exp3 provided a lower VIacu to D. In this
way, it failed to use the frequency information of

rather frequent morphemes, and thus performed
worse than Exp2.
Regarding the experiments using the most fre-
quent 100 morphemes, Exp3 performed better
than Exp2. This was likely caused by the fact that
more information on the frequencies of morphemes
was used in the baseline in this case, and thus re-
sulted in a situation in which less information was
available for D. The fact that fewer differences in the
VIacu of D between Exp2 and Exp3 were found when
using the most frequent 100 morphemes corres-
ponds to this point. The results indicate that, in
such a situation, indicators like CoD that provide
different types of textual information should be ef-
fective at discriminating between the authors of
texts. The fact that Exp3 performed better than
Exp2 with the most frequent 100 morphemes, and
that CoD showed an especially high VIacu in this case
corresponds to this point.
We conclude that the selection of indicators
should be made in accordance with the par-
ticular situation: when the information on the
frequencies of morphemes is insufficient, we
should use indicators that provide this kind of in-
formation first, but when that kind of informa-
tion has already been adequately obtained, we
should use indicators that provide other types of
textual information.
5.5 What information did CoD use?
Our results showed that CoD was an especially im-
portant indicator for discriminating between au-
thors of texts; thus in this subsection, we first
qualitatively discuss what types of textual informa-
tion CoD used. CoD is an extension of D, and
should reflect the information of frequent
co-occurrent combinations. Thus, for examining
what types of textual information CoD used, we
need to focus on the frequent co-occurrent combin-
ations. Table 6 lists pairs of morphemes, their
parts-of-speech, and frequencies, of the fifteen
most frequent co-occurrent combinations of the
text of ‘Kare (He)’ written by Akutagawa, which
had the highest CoD value. Table 6 lists frequent
co-occurrent combinations of the texts including
combinations of (i) particle and particle, (ii) par-
ticle and auxiliary verb, and (iii) pronouns and

writing in Japanese, e.g. whether the author used
subjective case (Kare wa) and objective case (ie
wo) in the same sentence, or whether he or she
used objective case (ie wo) and locative case
(Hongo no) in the same sentence, etc. They re-
flected different information as the collocation of
the texts, which, according to Hoover (2003b),
co-occurrences in n word window in English re-
flected. In addition, they reflected completely differ-
ent information that was given by bi-gram
characteristics, frequently used in various NLP
tasks including authorship analysis. Our methods,
based on the frequent co-occurrent combinations,
captured the aspects of the authors writing styles
without any loss in high classification performance,
and thus complemented the previously used
indicators that reflected the frequencies of the mor-
phemes. This indicator can be used for understand-
ing any aspects of the writing characteristics of the
authors of the texts.
5.6 Discussion on network indicators
Our results show that L and C were not as effective
as CoD for discriminating between the authors. As
shown in Figure 2, L and C were affected by the
number of nodes and also Ve and NoS were not
so effective for authorship attribution, as was
shown in Table 5. But the qualitative analysis of
the texts showed that it can clarify special characters
of the authors of the texts. For example, a novel by
Kikuchi (KIKU112) had an especially high L value,
as illustrated in Figure 2. Qualitative examination of
this novel showed us that it included many conver-
sational sentences. We removed these sentences, but
the text still included many incomplete sentences
like ‘he said’. This indicator can detect these types
of texts, which can be used for interpreting the au-
thors writing styles.
A qualitative examination of the texts showed
that low Ci morphemes in fact contained many fre-
quent morphemes such as function words, while
high Ci morphemes contained many infrequent
morphemes including hapax legomena. As we men-
tioned in Section 3, this can be explained by the fact
that frequent morphemes have high Ei(Ei 1),
while infrequent morphemes have low Ei(Ei 1).
Compared to the author’s preferences to frequent
or infrequent morphemes, their preferences to am-
biguous or unambiguous morphemes were not clear
in our qualitative examination. This could be be-
cause we used all morphemes in the texts, and
thus the Cis were more strongly affected by the au-
thor’s preferences to frequent or infrequent mor-
phemes. In contrast, a previous study (Dorow et
al., 2005) used nouns exclusively.13 From these re-
sults, we can conclude that that C - the mean of Ci
for all the morphemes—can shed light on aspects of
the authors styles. In addition, C also showed us the
special characteristics of the texts regarding the sen-
tences. For example, a novel by Dazai (DAZA192),
which had an unusual number of long sentence
lengths, and that was also detected because it ob-
tained the highest C value. Notwithstanding that
these indicators did not improve the performance
as CoD, our results implied that these indicators can
reveal aspects about the authors styles. Thus, these
indicators can be used for characterizing the texts,
and can be useful in interpreting the texts.
6 Conclusion
This study proposed the use of indicators based on
the co-occurrent combinations between morphemes
for use in authorship analysis. The results indicated
that our indicators were effective for capturing the
aspects of the styles of the authors as well as for
discriminating between them. We concluded that
our proposed indicators successfully supplemented
the information provided by the conventional lex-
ical indicators based on the frequencies of the mor-
phemes, and thus were effective enough for use with
new applications in authorship analysis.
Our indicators can be used in new application
areas of authorship analysis including authorship
profiling and computational sociolinguistics, as
well as in conventional application areas such as
authorship attribution. For the first types of appli-
cations, it is necessary to investigate the authors
profile and character based on the characteristics
of the texts. Thus, it would be effective to use our
indicators in an exploratory way with qualitative
analysis of the texts. For the second types of appli-
cations, it is important to improve the classification

performance; thus it would be useful to add our
indicators to the state-of-the-art features.
We proceed to list some possible future applica-
tions of our indicators. One potential use of these
indicators is in an exploratory analysis for author-
ship detection using a special character, similar to
what Suzuki and Kageura showed in their analysis of
political speeches with a concentration indicator D
(Suzuki and Kageura, 2007). They showed that lex-
ical indicator D clarified the singularity of Koizumi’s
speeches from all the Japanese prime ministers after
World War II, which was not made clear when
focusing on the respective uses of the function
words. Our indicators can be used for similar pur-
poses, but focus on the aspects of authors styles.
They can contribute to new applications like
authorship profiling or computational sociolinguis-
tics as well as conventional applications like author-
ship attribution.
Another potential application of these indicators
is in plagiarism detection. This is one of the most
interesting application areas in authorship analysis.
As our indicators captured the aspects of the styles
of the authors, they will be useful for detecting the
parts written by the author and other parts that have
been plagiarized.14 We also explore the possibilities
to apply our indicators to the study on figurative
language extraction such as metonymy (Fass, 1991),
metaphor (Gedigian et al., 2006; Shutova et al.,
2010) and irony (Carvalho et al., 2009; Veale and
Hao, 2010).
In the future, we will focus more on the use of
network indicators like L and C. These indicators
take into the global structure of a graph, and thus
could have an important role for analyzing the char-
acter of the author’s texts. In fact, the results of our
experiments showed that these indicators were not
so effective in discriminating between authors as
CoD did, but can however be useful for interpreting
the author’s characters. These indicators should
depend significantly on the sample size Ve and the
number of sentences NoS, and for these reasons,
were not so effective in discriminating between au-
thors as CoD in our experiments. We can improve
these indicators regarding the sample size depend-
ency, one possible approach would be applying
Monte Carlo simulations to adjust the number of
nodes. Another would be transforming these indi-
cators analytically.
In addition, we found correlations between NoS,
LoS, and L, C, and CoD to some extent. We will
compare the discriminative power of the former
and latter indicators because the former ones can
be calculated more easily. We will investigate these
points in future studies.

Notes
1 In other words, the former emphasized the structural
characteristics made by co-occurrence graph, whereas
the latter emphasized the distributional characteristics
made by co-occurrent combinations.
2 Both (iii) and (iv) are based on the co-occurrent com-
binations between morphemes, but for descriptive pur-
poses, we name (iv) the co-occurrence-based indicators
below.
3 We decided to show the results using the top 100
morphemes as a baseline, after we conducted the ex-
periments with other numbers of morphemes (the top
200, . . . , the top 1000) and confirmed that changing
the number of morphemes had no material effect on
the discussion of the results.
4 A bag of function words may improve the perform-
ance, but our main purpose is to examine what types
of information these indicators use, instead of achiev-
ing its the-state-of-the-art performance, thus a bag of
words is better as a baseline. See also Section 4.3 re-
garding this point.
5 C1,1 is called the entropy.
6 These indicators were not necessarily effective for dis-
criminating between the authors of texts, but we used
them in our experiments because we would like to
compare the variable importance of these indicators
to D. We also used these types of indicators for com-
parison regarding the network indicators and
co-occurrence-based indicators.
7 It should be noted that they called clustering coeffi-
cient the ‘curvature’.

10 The line of Exp1 (baseline) starts when the number of
morphemes is three, because the F1 values were not
able to be calculated (i.e. NA) when there were fewer
than three morphemes. We also performed the kinds
of experiments using the most frequent one to 500
morphemes, and confirmed that all the results and
discussion below were valid for that case.
11 Our significant tests were performed for the mean F1
values given by 100 repeated random forests experi-
ments. We did them for the values given by a separate
random forests experiment and there found no signifi-
cant differences in most cases, because the random
forests used the random digits and the results of indi-
vidual experiments significantly depended on them.
12 Our results suggest that we can improve the classifi-
cation performance even more when we use only im-
portant features in our feature set like D and CoD, and
add them to bag of words, because our feature set
includes the features that are not effective for discrim-
ination between authors, like N, V(N), TTR, GR, Ve,
E, CoN and CoV(N). We will conduct a systematic
evaluation in a further study.
13 We will investigate this point in detail in a further
study.
14 Yearly competitions have been held regarding this task
(Potthast et al., 2009, 2010a).
