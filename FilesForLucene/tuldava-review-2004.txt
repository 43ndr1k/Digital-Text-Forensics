The Development of Statistical Stylistics (A Survey)

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS
It is generally accepted that stylistic analysis, ‘‘the study of patterns formed in
the process of the linguistic encoding of information, is of importance to any
major research focusing upon or dependent upon the production or analysis
of language’’ (S.Y. Sedelow & W.A. Sedelow, 1966, p. 1). Present-day sty-
listic studies have gradually been acquiring a strict systemic character. An
increasing interest is also apparent in the quantitative aspect, where the
statistical and numerical counts of linguistic objects, the comparison and
analysis of quantitative data, as well as the use of electronic computers, have
given stylistics a more exact basis than hitherto. A quantitatively rigorous and
intense study of style in natural languages has given rise to statistical stylistics
(or stylostatistics, also called stylometrics or quantitative stylistics and, with
the advent of computers, computational stylistics).
Statistical stylistics deals with two interdependent issues:
1. investigating texts from the standpoint of individual or functional styles,
and
2. investigating texts with a view of author identification, particularly in case
of disputed or anonymous authorship.
It has been noted that statistical stylistics is closely connected with
language typology (e.g., Greenberg, 1960; Herdan, 1960; Tesitelová, 1977)
and textology. New methods of research, such as factor and cluster analyses,
discriminant analysis, path analysis, etc. make statistical stylistics even a more
sensitive tool for analysis of individual and functional styles (genres and
registers), including the style of fiction. The traditional qualitative methods

will not disappear – they only get a good helpmate, a sufficiently precise
instrument in form of statistical and other quantitative methods. It is also
useful to remember the apt remark of Perebejnos (1967): ‘‘statistical methods
enable us not only to check up the correctness of our intuitive views about
style, but also establish such regularities, which could not be found by other
methods’’. On the whole, statistical stylistics has immediate, practical
implications for the studies in various areas, ranging from stylolinguistics
and literary research and criticism, to other social sciences (pedagogy,
sociology, psychology, etc.).
SOME PRINCIPLES OF STYLOSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS
As to the notion of style, we agree with the statement that ‘‘style is an
amorphous all-emcompassing entity which cannot be meaningfully
discussed except from a specific viewpoint’’ (O’Donnell, 1966, p. 108).
From the viewpoint of statistical stylistics, it seems reasonable to proceed
from the thesis that ‘‘style is a probabilistic concept’’ by which selection
(choice), conscious or unconscious, can be considered the basic component
of the style-forming process, emerging from the fact that there are several
possibilities for expressing an idea which the speaker employs in selecting
the most appropriate mode of expression from a set of alternatives (Dolozel,
1969, p. 10 ff). In terms of the probabilistic approach, the repeated selective
operation will result in the arrangement of set A into a probability
distribution
PfAg ¼ PðaÞ;PðbÞ . . .PðnÞ ð1Þ
Dolozel in his essay ‘‘A Framework for the Statistical Analysis of Style’’
(1969) has made an attempt to outline a probabilistic theory of style in
which he notes that a probabilistic approach reveals the stylistic stability
behind the variability of concrete manifestations (i.e., the fluctuations of
frequency distributions). In practical work the student has to use specific
statistical procedures – statistical tests – to distinguish between insignif-
icant fluctuations which do not affect the basic character of style and
significant fluctuations which signal differences in styles or stylistic
change.

The stylistic analysis is aimed at
1. viewing and explaining an individual system of stylistic means, or
2. examining an individual system against the background of other, most
often similar systems (e.g., discussing style as ‘‘deviation from norm’’
according to Guiraud, Kjetsaa (1979) and others.
In both cases – 1. and 2. – the basic component of the style-forming process
remains selection (choice), as accepted by many authors (e.g., Arnold, 1974;
Krallmann, 1966; Lesskis, 1973; Winter, 1969).
The process of selection is controlled not only by subjective factors but also
by objective factors in accordance with the requirements of context (in the
broadest sense), such as time and place, genre, the form of discourse (dialogue
or monologue), linguistic restrictions, and so on. The specification of the text
characteristics – subjective or objective – requires the establishment of a
pragmatic classification of texts (see Dolozel, 1969, p. 17 ff). The set of a
language, symbolically T(L), can be classified into two dimensions:
1. according to the subjective factors – T(Xi), that is, classes of texts pro-
duced by a certain speaker or writer, and
2. according to the objective factors – T(Qj), that is, classes of texts in a
certain context Qj. As the two criteria are independent, they can be applied
in combination:
TðXiQjÞ ð2Þ
to represent text sets by a certain speaker or writer in a certain context,
giving classes T(X1Q1), T(X1Q2), . . .T(X2Q1), T(X2Q2), etc.
Formula (2) helps account for stylistic differences between the texts and
provide a framework for the taxonomy of texts in stylostatistical analysis. A
specification of the formula reveals (according to Dolozel, 1969, pp. 18–19):
1. supra-stylistic features, that is, stable characteristics in a language, which
represent a background for stylistic differentiation of texts;
2. sub-stylistic features, produced by the significant fluctuations within the
classes [according to Equation (2)], which are to be explained by the
impact of inaccountable and undescribable factors;
3. Eliminating both supra-stylistic and sub-stylistic characteristics from the
text-style formula, we shall finally obtain a set of characteristics proper.

Further specification of the style characteristics will lead to the disclosure
of subjective, objective and subjective/objective ‘‘distinctive features’’ of
style. (See Dolozel, 1969, pp. 21–22.)
The importance of discovering and making use of appropriate stylistic
discriminators (characteristics) cannot be overstressed. Many linguistic
characteristics on various levels (lexical, grammatical, phonetic or phonolo-
gical) have been proposed as criteria of style which should serve as
discriminators in identifying and comparing texts and their authors or genres.
A survey of them will be given in a following article. Very often, the question
is not only how to formally distinguish an individual or functional style
(genre) from another one but also to give a qualitative interpretation (if
needed) of the formal quantitative text characteristics. In some of the recent
style theories quantity and frequency as a source of style have been interpreted
in pragmatic and cognitive frame (Nagy, 1998). Also the interrelation of the
expressive means of a language (e.g., emotional words) and the ideas
expressed has been examined in statistical stylistics, particularly in poetics.
In general, it seems reasonable to distinguish between two kinds of style
characteristics, qualitative and quantitative (Tuldava, 1998, pp. 41–42):
1. latent (‘‘covert’’) variables, that is, qualitative characteristics that the
researcher has chosen and fixed for stylistic analysis but which are openly
not observable and measurable
2. formal-statistical (‘‘overt’’) variables, or indicators which can directly be
observed and measured in the texts.
Undoubtedly, there has to exist a logical connection between the qualitative
latent variables and the formal-statistical variables. In the framework of
statistical stylistics this connection can only be oblique and probabilistic. The
task is to establish good and appropriate indicators founded on experience and
theoretically acceptable assumptions. The widespread qualitative stylistic
notion of ‘‘lexical richness’’ which can be compared, under given conditions,
with the relative size of vocabulary or the ratio of hapax legomena, might
serve as an example. However, we have to remember that any interpretation of
stylostatistical data has a highly hypothetical character, and only if both
qualitative and quantitative approaches lead to similar results is the conclusion
more likely to be sound. ‘‘If they disagree, however, both sides must think
again’’ (Williams, 1970, p. 149).
Besides providing criteria for formal-statistical and qualitative analysis,
another problem has to be solved, the problem of sampling technique. It is

clearly necessary that the sampled data are representative of the work being
examined. Of course, if the work under consideration is not too lengthy, one
can use the whole of it. But even then it could be divided into several
subsamples in order to assess the reliability of one’s measures. The main
objective in selecting samples is to get a measure of the accuracy needed, with
the least possible unnecessary work. Williams has noted: ‘‘There is no way of
finding the best number or size of sample without some preliminary survey
and estimation of error. The number and size of samples depend on many
factors, including: 1) what degree of accuracy is demanded by the question
one is trying to answer; 2) how reliable one requires the result to be; 3) how
variable is the material examined within itself; 4) when comparing two sets of
data, how large is the difference between them in relation to the variability
within each.’’ The ways in which sampled data have been obtained
substantially influence the methods of analysis. (For more about sampling
methods in stylostatistic analysis, see e.g., Enkvist, 1978; Somers, 1966,
pp. 129–133; Williams, 1970, pp. 31–32, pp. 72–75.)
A HISTORICAL SURVEY
The history of modern statistical stylistics apparently begins in the middle of
the 19th century when the English mathematician Augustus de Morgan in a
letter to a friend in 1851 made a suggestion that the styles of different authors
could be distinguished by means of hidden statistical characters (cit. by Lord,
1958). His suggestions were made regarding some problems of Greek prose:
de Morgan argued that the average length of words by an author might well
prove to be a characteristic trait of a writer’s style.
There was also a group of mid-nineteenth-century scholars who developed
a technique called ‘‘Stylometrics’’ (Williams, 1970, p. 3). They counted the
numbers of repetitions of certain words and the variation of metre in verse.
The researchers presented their results as averages or percentages. The school
reached its height with the foundation, about 1874, of the New Shakespearean
Society. Among the members of the Society were, for example Fleary (‘‘On
metrical tests applied to dramatic poetry I. Shakespeare’’, 1874), Ingram
(1874), Furnival (1887). The main result of their work was the discovering of a
slow but steady change in style during the 22 years over which Shakespeare
wrote 36 plays starting in 1589 when he was 26 years of age and ending in
1612 when he was 48.

The term ‘‘stylometry’’ (stylometrics) was also used by the German
researcher Dittenberger (1880) who made an attempt to solve the task of
determining the attribution and chronology of the dialogues of Plato. He
examined the frequencies of words, mainly function words, in Plato’s texts.
Later on, his investigations on various material were continued by Zeller
(1887), Cǎda (1901) and Ritter (1903), the latter comparing Plato and Goethe
statistically. (cit. by Martynenko, 1988, p. 5).
The development of the ideas of de Morgan was furthered by the work of
Mendenhall, an American geophysician, who, between 1887 and 1901,
studied word length in English. He realized that the distribution of words of
different lengths gave more opportunities for comparison of styles than the
simple arithmetic mean proposed by de Morgan. Mendenhall’s first paper
(1887) entitled ‘‘The Characteristic Curve of Composition’’ was an out-
standing advance towards the present-day stylostatistical approach. He investi-
gated the difference between the literary styles of Dickens and Thackeray
insofar as word-length distribution was concerned and gave also examples of
other writings in modern and classical languages. All his results were shown
in the form of graphs (‘‘word spectrums’’ as he called them), unfortunately
without the lists of original numbers. In a later article (1901), Mendenhall
used word-length frequency distributions in a study of the authorship of
Shakespeare’s plays. He showed that in every single count from Shakespeare’s
plays, there were more words with four letters than three. In comparison,
Bacon had more three-letter words than four-letter words. Bacon had also a
distinctly higher proportion of longer words than Shakespeare. So the word-
length distribution of Bacon was completely different from that of
Shakespeare. Mendenhall showed also that in comparison with Christopher
Marlowe, there was better agreement with the word-length distribution of
Shakespeare.
Mendenhall’s published works seem to have attracted little attention at that
time. In this early period of statistical stylistics, only a few investigations
using statistical methods can be reported, for example the study by Sherman
(1888) on sentence-length in English prose. H.A. Parker (1889) studied
sentence-length in two works by Carlyle. Hildreth (1897) made a new con-
tribution to the Shakespeare-Bacon controversy. Lutoslawski (1897) used
statistical methods in establishing the chronology of Plato’s dialogues, Frank
wrote on the frequency of colour terms in Goethe’s works, Parzinger (1911)
studied the evolution of Cicero’s style. In Russia the mathematician Markov
(1913) applied statistical methods to the study of ‘‘Yevgenij Onegin’’ by

Pushkin, and Morozov (1915) studied the problem of how to distinguish
plagiarized forms from the genuine works of well-known authors by
examining the use and the frequency of function words and their variations
in individual texts. However, Morozov employed only simple numerical
counts.
In the 1920s only a few stylostatistic works can be reported, for example by
R.E. Parker (1925), Chandler (1928), Parry (1928) and, particularly,
Busemann (1925), the inventor of the so-called Adjective-Verb-Quotient.
In the 1930s a new step was made in the use of statistical methods in
stylistics by such authors as: Fletcher (1934) who examined the evolution of
the style of Spenser, Bolling (1937) with a critical essay on the statistical
investigation of Homer’s language, and finally such classics of statistical
stylistics as Carroll (1938) who raised the problem of diversity of vocabulary
and the law of word-frequency distribution, and Yule (1938/1939) with his
first study on the sentence-length distribution as a statistical characteristic of
style and later, in 1944, with his well-known study of literary vocabulary in
which he presented his famous ‘‘Characteristic K’’.
With Yule, we have the real start of the application of modern statistical
methods in stylistics. Since then the study of stylistic problems with the help
of statistical methods has spread throughout the world, and numerous concrete
studies in the field of stylostatistics (concerning various languages) have
attracted attention, beginning with the works of Fucks (1952) and Guiraud
(1954, 1959). There was a rapid growth of interest in statistical linguistics,
especially in the period of the 1960s and the 1970s, including works such as
Carroll (1960), Herdan (1960), Somers (1960), Muller (1964), Kelemen
(1964), Mistrı́k (1967), Dolezel (1969), Williams (1970), Golovin (1971),
Tesitelová (1977), Kraus (1972), Perebejnos (1967), Zsilka (1974), Engwall
(1974), Hassler-G€oransson (1976), and Altmann (1978), to mention only some
of the authors of that period; a great number of essays in the collections
‘‘Mathematik und Dichtung’’ (Kreuzer & Gunzenh€auser, 1965), ‘‘The
Computer and Literary Style’’ (Leed, 1966), ‘‘Statistics and Style’’ (Dolezel
& Bailey, 1969), ‘‘Voprosy statisticeskoj stilistiki’’ (Tuldava, 1974), ‘‘The
Computer in Literary and Linguistic Studies’’ (Jones & Churchhouse, 1976),
and many others; various series such as ‘‘Prague Studies in Mathematical
Linguistics’’ (1966–), ‘‘Studia metrica et poetica’’ (1976–), ‘‘Glottometrika’’
(1978–); the journal ‘‘Quantitative Linguistics’’; graduate theses and
dissertations; and the proceedings of numerous conferences in quantitative
linguistics.

The most recent works are also very numerous, among them can be
mentioned the monographs of Thoiron (1980), Tesitelová et al. (1985), Arapov
(1988), Martynenko (1988), Hrebı́cek (1992), Tuldava (1995, 1998), and some
special studies on text attribution (assignment of authorship) and textology,
written by Kjetsaa et al. (1984, 1986), Vasák (1980, 1986), Ermolenko (1988),
Levitskij (1969), and Marusenko (1990), where stylostatistical methods have
been used.
Also various surveys have appeared from time to time, for example by
Thavenius (1966), Herdan (1960), Bailey (1968), Williams (1970), Tesitelová
(1977), with bibliographies.
Special bibliographies, devoted to statistical stylistics, can be found in ‘‘An
Annotated Bibliography of Statistical Stylistics’’ by Bailey and Dolozel
(1968) and in the recently published ‘‘Bibliography of Quantitative
Linguistics’’ by K€ohler (1995), under the section ‘‘Stylistics’’ (pp. 377–401).
