ABSTRACT 
 
 Each language has some means or system of referring to participants.  This system of 
reference includes a participant’s initial introduction, continuing reference to the participant, as well 
as reintroduction after some period of absence.  A number of morphological, syntactic and pragmatic 
issues impinge upon the kinds of encoding used to refer to participants in various contexts.  The 
primary concern of this study is to provide a cross-linguistic, discourse-functional description of the 
encoding of participants in Biblical Hebrew narrative.  Our description is based on the analysis of a 
preliminary test corpus of Exod 1-12, which is then applied to our dissertation corpus of Gen 12-25.  
In order to narrow the scope of the project, the data considered in this dissertation will be limited to 
the corpora of Exod 1-12 and Gen 12-25.  It will not consider embedded reported speeches, but 
instead focuses exclusively and exhaustively on the narrative proper of these two corpora. 
 Dooley and Levinsohn (2001:112) have identified three basic linguistic functions a 
participant reference system must be capable of accomplishing:  
• Semantic:  “identify the referents unambiguously, distinguishing them from other 
possible ones”.  In other words, the reader must be able to track ‘who did what to whom’, 
• Processing:  “overcome disruptions in the flow of information”, 
• Discourse-pragmatic:  “signal the activation status and prominence of the referents or the 
actions they perform”.                              
We propose that these three functions are not discrete categories, but represent a hierarchical 
entailment scheme.  In other words, overencoding a participant to accomplish the processing function 
at the same time accomplishes a semantic function of identifying the participant.  The study begins by 
providing a description of the default encoding based on the semantic and cognitive constraints 
present in various discourse contexts.  Our methodology is to develop a set of default encoding 
principles based on the semantic function of participant reference which can account for as much of 
the attested data as possible.  These default principles are also used to identify pragmatically-
motivated departures from the default norms.  The non-default encoding is construed as explicitly 
marking the presence of some linguistic feature.   
 The non-default encoding data are then grouped based on the pragmatic effects they achieve, 
and are described in light of attested cross-linguistic principles.  We claim that the processing function 
of participant reference is accomplished in Biblical Hebrew through the redundant relexicalization of 
agents.  These redundant NPs have the pragmatic effect of segmenting the discourse into distinct 
developments.  Next we describe the pragmatic use of referring expressions as accomplishing the 
discourse-pragmatic function of thematic highlighting.  Finally, we describe participant encoding 
which exceeds that necessary for the processing function as accomplishing a second discourse-
pragmatic function of cataphorically highlighting a following speech or event.  Finally, these 
 iii
descriptions are applied to Gen 27 to demonstrate their explanatory value for exposition of Biblical 
Hebrew narrative.

2. Linguistic and Theoretical Framework 
 Several major studies in the area of participant reference have been conducted over the years, 
both in linguistics proper and in biblical studies.  One common characteristic of these studies is that 
the analysts seemed to focus on only one aspect of participant reference, e.g. the processing function.  
Based on attention to the chosen aspect, the scholars were able to describe a bit more of the data than 
previous studies, yet still end up leaving a portion of the data unexplained.  There are very few 
comprehensive studies which consider all three typological functions of participant reference: 
semantic, processing and pragmatic.  The primary factor influencing the efficacy of a study’s 
explanatory power is its theoretical frame of reference.  The limitations of the theoretical framework 
seem to be directly proportional to the amount of data that is left unexplained. 
 The purpose of this chapter is to formulate a theoretical frame of reference which is capable 
of supporting a coherent description of participant reference in Biblical Hebrew narrative.  We begin 
by discussing the rationale for selecting a functional, discourse-pragmatic approach.  Next we outline 
the cognitive issues which impact a reader’s processing of participant reference in order to 
incorporate these constraints into our description.  The cognitive framework is followed by a 
discussion of syntactic issues which place certain constraints on the encoding of participants.  The 
survey of cognitive and syntactic issues will allow us to understand how these factors influence 
default encoding values.  It will also allow these constraints to be adequately incorporated into our 
description.   
 Next we consider the cross-linguistic functions of participant reference.  These functions 
provide guidance in determining the function of both default and non-default encoding. This is 
followed by a brief discussion of pragmatic implicatures and how they influence the processing of 
discourse.  Our goal for this theoretical frame of reference is that it be able to account the pragmatic 
functions of participant reference. It must also take into account cognitive principles of language 
processing, as well as cross-linguistic and typological principles of referential encoding. Finally we 
will evaluate the relevant linguistic studies on participant reference using our theoretical framework 
to verify that it is able to account for attested encoding. 
2.1 Methodological Framework:  Levinsohn’s Default/Marked Framework 
 In this section we introduce Levinsohn’s methodology for identifying and describing marked 
forms on the basis of a proposed default canonical form.  This methodology is also used as an 
evaluative tool in this chapter and the next to critique studies in the field. 
2.1.1 Introduction  
 The methodological framework for this study is that developed by Levinsohn (1978, 1990, 
1994, 2000a, 2000b, 2003), Dooley and Levinsohn (2001), and Bailey and Levinsohn (1992).  It has 
been referred to as the default/marked method by Clark (2000).  The default/marked concept is not 
 20
so much a method as a methodological framework for both developing and adapting methods of 
linguistic description to fit a particular language or language feature.  Levinsohn’s approach combines 
three concepts into an eclectic, yet very adaptable framework for linguistic studies.  His approach is a 
functional, descriptive application of markedness theory.3  Let us consider each of these ideas in turn. 
Functional:   
A functional approach according to Dooley is “an attempt to discover and describe what 
linguistic structures are used for:  the functions they serve, the factors that condition their use” 
(1989:1).  A structural approach to grammar prototypically describes how the possible encoding 
options are used; yet it rarely explains why one form is used in a particular context as opposed to 
another.  In contrast, a functional approach is concerned with understanding why a particular form is 
used as opposed to simply how the form is used (Van Wolde 1997:21).    
 A functional approach to linguistics is grounded in the assumption that ‘choice implies 
meaning’ (Andrews 1990).  In instances where there is more than one option for grammaticalizing an 
utterance, there is likely some kind of pragmatic choice which guides the speaker to choose one 
encoding option over another.  Each choice is assumed to have a unique, pragmatic implicature 
associated with it, i.e. a meaningful difference.  Rather than simply listing the options available to the 
speaker, this study will attempt to provide a description of the pragmatic effect or ‘meaning’ 
underlying each choice.   
The corollary of ‘choice implies meaning’ holds true as well: ‘no choice implies no meaning’.  
It will be demonstrated that certain Biblical Hebrew constructions which have been viewed by some 
as ‘marked’ or ‘emphatic’ in fact represent a default encoding constraint.  If there is no choice 
associated with the particular use of the form in a context, it is inappropriate to assign any pragmatic 
‘meaning’ to its use.  Assuredly stylistic differences between speakers account for some differences in 
usage.  All too frequently though, such an explanation is cited when a grammarian is unable to 
explain the meaning underlying the variation.  As Levinsohn has stated, “too often, the terms 
‘optional’ and ‘stylistic variation’ are synonyms of ‘don’t know’!” (2000a:viii).   
 The study of Fox (1983) on topic continuity in Biblical Hebrew provides a representative 
illustration of the limits of structural studies as a heuristic tool.  He found that the referential distance 
(number of clauses since the last mention of a referent) is virtually identical for three different levels 
of morphological encoding:  clitic pronouns, independent pronouns, and ‘Y-movement’ (ibid:242).  
While Fox was able to empirically document the various options, he was unable to explain why one 
form was used and not another.  While his study provided a useful description, it is of little heuristic 
value in helping the analyst determine the implicatures of using one form instead of another. 
                                                     
3 For a thorough, theoretical introduction to an asymmetrical view of markedness theory as applied here, cf. 
Andrews (1990). 
 21
 To illustrate the principle of ‘no choice implies no meaning’, let us consider Fox’s description 
of independent pronouns in Biblical Hebrew.  He claims that clitic pronouns are the default level of 
encoding for all Biblical Hebrew verbal forms.  However, non-finite verbal forms (e.g., participles 
and infinitives absolute) do not grammaticalize subject agreement, nor do verbless clauses.  Thus, 
non-finite verbal and verbless clauses require use of at least an independent personal pronoun to 
encode the subject.  However, Fox fails to factor this into his account of Biblical Hebrew 
morphology.  This leads him to observe: “In non-verbal clauses in EBH [Early Biblical Hebrew], 
unstressed, non-contrastive independent pronouns are almost obligatory, used much like subject 
agreement in verbal clauses” (ibid:252). It would seem more accurate to describe the use of 
independent personal pronouns as required for non-finite clauses, i.e. the default form.  Such a view 
would bolster his claim that subject agreement is obligatory, a claim which we would agree with.  
Descriptive: 
 A descriptive study seeks to move beyond cataloging the optional uses of a linguistic feature 
to describing the ‘meaning’ associated with each of the choices available.  Such a description neither 
seeks to predict usage, nor prescribes how conventions should be used.  A functional description 
analyzes actual usage.  It develops a unified explanation which is not only able to account for the 
presence of a feature in a context, but which is able to account for its absence in a different context 
(Levinsohn 2000a:ix).  The key to developing such a description lies in understanding what 
grammatical or pragmatic feature each choice specifically ‘marks’ as being present. 
Markedness:   
 Markedness theory, as described by Andrews (1990), presupposes that asymmetrical sets of 
linguistic oppositions exist which function as markers for the presence or absence of a particular 
feature.4  The sets are said to be asymmetrical in that one member of the set indicates the presence of 
a particular feature (called the ‘marked’ form), while some other member of the set (the ‘default’ 
form) is considered to be unmarked for the feature.  The recognition of asymmetry to this view of 
markedness is crucial, in that the default form does not signal the opposite of the marked form.  
Instead, the feature in question may or may not be present; the default form is not explicitly marked 
for the feature.   
 The novelty of Levinsohn’s application of markedness theory lies in the identification and 
utilization of default forms.  Traditionally, defaults are identified statistically:  the most frequently 
occurring form is assumed to be the default.5  An ancillary implication of such a statistically-based 
                                                     
4 Cf. van Wolde (1997:25ff) for a summary of markedness theory and an application of it to Biblical Hebrew 
syntax. 
5 Cf. Andrews’ (1990:136ff) very insightful chapter entitled “Myths about Markedness” which debunks some 
commonly held notions regarding the use of statistics in distinguishing default and marked forms. 
 22
selection is to view frequency of use as inversely proportional to semantic significance.6  Such a 
framework does not describe the asymmetrical presence or absence of a feature, but instead results in 
a statistically-based semantic hierarchy, with the least frequently occurring forms conveying the most 
semantic meaning.  Such a framework often turns out to have little heuristic value in differentiating 
the meaningful difference of using one form over against another other than to say it is somehow 
‘more marked’. 
 Levinsohn’s approach is to organize descriptions based on the feature that is marked by each 
member of the set.  Rather than selecting a default based on frequency, Levinsohn advocates selecting 
a provisional default based on identifying the most basic or simplex form of the feature in question 
through a preliminary study.  The most unmarked form serves as the canonical baseline for the 
description of each marked form.  This process of identifying the default might require that 
modifications be made to the proposal.7  Since the default form is the least marked, its use does not 
need to be explained.  The default is used when the speaker has chosen not to mark the presence of 
any feature.  The most basic form sometimes turns out to indeed be the most frequently occurring, but 
this is not always the case.  The efficacy of the proposed default will directly affect the quality of the 
final description. 
 This preliminary study to isolate the least-marked member of a set has several objectives.  
First, the analyst must inventory the linguistic choices available for encoding a particular feature.  
Second, he or she must also identify the different contextual constraints which influence the selection 
of one encoding option as opposed to another.  For example, to begin a study of participant reference, 
one would begin by cataloguing the various morphological encoding options available in the 
language.  Many contextual constraints affect encoding decisions.  Examples of these constraints 
include whether a participant is brand new or already established in the discourse, whether a 
participant is a major or minor one, the kind of participant he or she is interacting with, and the genre 
of the discourse. 
 Finally, the analyst proposes a least-marked encoding option as the ‘default’ based upon the 
results of the preliminary empirical analysis of the data.8  This default option then becomes the foil 
against which proposed marked options are described.  For instance, the preterite verb in Biblical 
Hebrew is widely accepted as being the default narrative verb form, signaling +continuity and 
+perfective aspect (Buth 1995:99; cf. Longacre 1983:65f and Levinsohn 2002:128).  With this default 
                                                     
6 E.g. Porter’s description of verbal aspect in Koine Greek is based on a symmetrical view, and is largely based 
on discourse frequency: “The perfective (aorist) aspect is least heavily weighted of the Greek verbal aspects, and 
hence carries the least significant meaning attached to use of the form…  The imperfective (present/imperfect) 
aspect is more heavily weighted, and to use it in opposition to the perfective (aorist) implies greater semantic 
significance” (1992:22). 
7 Cf. Dooley and Levinsohn (2001: 127ff) for a more complete description of the process. 
8 The application of typological principles here is crucial.  By respecting the demonstrable patterns to which 
certain language-types tend to adhere, the analyst may prevent many errors before they occur.  The analyst may 
also glean clues about how comparable linguistic tasks are accomplished in other languages. (cf. Chapter 3). 
 23
as the baseline, the analyst would then describe the other forms—such as w-x-qtl or participial 
forms—based on what feature(s) their presence explicitly signals that the default does not explicitly 
signal.  Such a method can be adapted and applied to virtually any feature, context, or language.   
 The default/marked methodology is exemplified in Li’s (1997) study of zero anaphora in Late 
Archaic Chinese.  He observes that very little of this language’s grammar is based on morpho-
syntactic rules, but instead on discourse-pragmatic ones.  He further notes that many Western 
linguists have sought to account for the zero-slot in Chinese based on the fact that Western languages 
must ‘drop’ a pronoun in order to achieve zero anaphora.  In Li’s view, Chinese speakers begin with 
zero anaphora as a default, and use higher levels of encoding for pragmatic purposes (ibid:278).  
Previous studies of Chinese had characterized zero anaphora as a so-called ‘reduced’ form.  Thus by 
hypothesizing that zero anaphora is the default encoding form for active participants, his goal is no 
longer to explain the presence of ‘default’ zero anaphora, but instead to describe the motivations and 
factors influencing departures from this default (ibid:275). 
 Claiming a certain form is the default is not to claim that it is used more frequently than any 
other form, or that it has less significance than any other form.  A default is simply the most basic, 
encoding option available for a particular feature.  It provides a heuristic canon against which to 
describe the explicitly-marked options.  If one finds that the chosen form is not the least marked, there 
is freedom to reorganize the descriptions.  Chapter 4 will provide a description of default encoding of 
participants for the narrative of our corpus, and will form the basis for our description of marked 
forms and usage in Chapters 5-7. 
 The so-called ‘default/marked’ methodology has been applied to participant reference studies 
in a variety of typologically-diverse languages.  Levinsohn first applied the approach to the Inga 
(Quechuan) language of Columbia (1978), to Koine Greek (1992, revised as 2000a) and then to 
Biblical Hebrew (Levinsohn 2000b). He has also supervised its application to a wide variety of 
languages through workshops for Bible translators (cf. Levinsohn 1994, Dooley and Levinsohn 
2001).  Clark (2000) conducted a comparative study of three different methods for describing 
participant reference (Givón 1983a, Tomlin 1987, and Levinsohn 2000a) to the Sio language of Papua 
New Guinea.  He concluded that Levinsohn’s framework provided the most adaptable and accurate 
description of the three. 
2.1.2 Benefits of a Default/Marked Framework 
Adaptable 
 This framework has been used successfully to describe linguistic features of very diverse, 
non-Western, minority languages, including the description of participant reference.  These languages 
utilize a variety of referential encoding systems (e.g. switch-reference systems, gender-based systems, 
 24
etc.9) and different anaphoric strategies (e.g. look-back strategies, VIP strategies10).  Levinsohn’s 
framework has also proven to be sufficiently flexible to allow for adaptation to the various constraints 
of diverse languages.  Its application to studies of participant reference will be reviewed in more 
detail in §2.4.4. 
Empirically-based 
 The importance of establishing an empirically defensible default cannot be underscored 
enough.  Numerous problems arise and compound in the absence of a properly established default.  
First, a flawed default can lead an analyst to misidentify truly marked forms as ‘default’, or vice 
versa.  Second, if the default has not been discretely isolated, one may end up describing what turns 
out to be two discrete features as a single feature, or worse yet classifying the anomaly as an 
exception.  If the baseline is flawed, the initial error tends to be compounded in the description and 
classification of non-default usage. 
Heuristic 
 The method provides a functional framework which allows the analyst not only to account for 
the presence of a feature via participant reference encoding, but also to account for its absence 
elsewhere. 
2.1.3 Semantic Meaning versus Pragmatic Effect 
 Languages tend to be very efficient.  They will frequently exploit the non-typical use of a 
grammatical feature to achieve a certain pragmatic effect.  Some languages track participants using 
switch reference markers, whereby “the verb of a dependent clause is morphologically marked to 
indicate whether or not the subject of that clause is the same as the subject of its linearly adjacent, 
structurally related independent clause.  If both subjects are coreferential, a SS [i.e. same subject] 
marker is used; otherwise, a DS [i.e. different subject] marker is employed” (Huang 2000:11).  In 
spite of this default principle, Huang notes the non-referential, pragmatic use of the DS marker in the 
Amele language in certain SS contexts: “In this language, a change of place and/or time warrants the 
use of a DS marker even if the subjects in question remain the same…  But typically the secondary 
functions of the switch-reference system are in addition to its primary function and are related to the 
encoding of some non-referential meanings” (2000:293, italics mine).  Hence the pragmatic effect of 
the DS marker in a SS context is to signal something in addition to its basic semantic meaning.  
Language strategies like this use of the DS marker serve to economize the number of different 
devices a language requires to meet the needs of its speakers.  Grammatical devices often play 
                                                     
9 Cf. Huang 2000:8ff for a typological description of each. 
10 Cf. Dooley and Levinsohn (2001:117ff) for a description of these strategies. 
 25
double-duty, pragmatically marking the presence of a feature in (non-default) contexts where such a 
device is semantically unexpected or unnecessary.11    
 Another example of the non-default use of a device to achieve a pragmatic effect is the non-
spatial use of spatial-deictic markers, e.g. demonstrative pronouns, to encode the relative salience of 
discourse referents.12  From a semantic perspective, the demonstrative pronouns this and that in 
English encode near and far spatial proximity, respectively, from the speaker’s point of view.  
However, when these demonstrative pronouns are applied to non-spatial referents, particularly in a 
comparative context, the near demonstrative has the pragmatic effect of marking the proximate 
referent as more salient than the distal referent (cf. Levinsohn 2003).  This ‘feature’ of marking 
relative salience is not a semantic component of the pronoun.  Instead, it is a pragmatic effect of its 
use in a particular context.  It will be argued that Biblical Hebrew narrative exploits overspecified or 
redundant NPs to accomplish several different pragmatic effects beyond their basic semantic function, 
depending upon the discourse context. 
2.2 Cognitive Framework 
2.2.1 Mental Representations   
 Understanding how humans process texts or discourse is foundational to understanding 
participant reference.  Andersen et al. (1983) suggest the following model:  “One way of looking at 
comprehension is to view it as a process of mapping elements in the sentence currently being 
interpreted into a [mental] representation established on the basis of the prior discourse.  According to 
such a view a single integrated representation of the discourse is constantly being updated as new 
information is encountered” (1983:427).  Information communicated via the discourse is then added 
to the hearer’s developing mental representation.  Lambrecht elaborates on this idea stating, “This 
representation is formed by the sum of ‘propositions’ which the hearer knows or believes or considers 
uncontroversial at the time of speech” (1994:43).  The mental representation is built either by 
contributing new information to the ‘files’ of existing discourse referents,13 or by ‘activating’ new 
referents.  
2.2.2 Identifiability 
  Before a speaker can add information about a referent, he or she must ensure that the hearer is 
able to uniquely identify the intended referent in his or her mental representation.  Lambrecht defines 
                                                     
11 Cf. §2.5 for a discussion of Huang’s (2000) M-principle, which explains the cognitive processing of such 
devices by a hearer or reader. 
12 Cf. Levinsohn 2003 and Linde 1979. 
13 Lambrecht notes, “Discourse referents are syntactically expressed in ARGUMENT (including adjunct) 
categories, such as noun phrases, pronouns, various kinds of tensed or non-tensed subordinate clauses, and 
certain adverbial phrases (those that can be said to refer to the circumstances of a predication).  They cannot 
normally be expressed in phrases which serve as PREDICATES.  Predicates by definition do not denote 
discourse referents but attributes of, or relations between, arguments” (1994:75).

this constraint of identifiability as “a speaker’s assessment of whether a discourse representation of a 
particular referent is already stored in a hearer’s mind or not” (ibid:76).  A referent is considered 
identifiable either if it is represented in the addressee’s mind, or if it can be referred to deictically or 
anaphorically (ibid:77).  Lambrecht likens the creation of a new discourse representation in the 
hearer’s mind “to establishing a unique information ‘file’ in the hearer’s mental representation, in 
which new information about the referent is stored throughout the discourse, and which can be 
retrieved in future discourses” (ibid:77).  This process of establishing a new referent in a discourse is 
referred to as activation (cf. §2.2.4). 
2.2.3 Discourse Register 
 As speakers and hearers begin a dialogue or discourse, both start with a certain amount of 
common knowledge about the world around them.  This knowledge forms the basic framework of 
what is called a ‘discourse register’.  Lambrecht defines the discourse register as “the set of 
representations which a speaker and hearer may be assumed to share in a given discourse” (ibid:47).  
As new participants and referents are introduced into the discourse, they are simultaneously added to 
the register.  Information gathered about the discourse referents is cognitively utilized to build the 
‘mental representation’ of both the referent and the discourse as a whole. 
2.2.4 Chafe’s Activation States  
 The prominence of a discourse referent in a hearer’s mental representation does not remain 
static throughout a discourse.  While it may figure prominently when first activated, a referent tends 
to lapse in its degree of ‘activation’ with each passing clause which does not make explicit or implicit 
reference to it.  Chafe has identified the following potential activation states a discourse referent can 
have at any one point in time as a means of describing this process of deactivation:  
• Active:  A concept “that is currently lit up, a concept in a person’s focus of consciousness 
at a particular moment”. 
• Semi-active: It is accessible, a concept “that is in a person’s peripheral consciousness, a 
concept of which a person has a background awareness, but one that is not being directly 
focused on”.   
• Inactive:  A concept “that is currently in a person’s long-term memory, neither focally nor 
peripherally active” (1987:22ff). 
The cognitive status of a participant undergoes a process of decay in the absence of continued 
reference to it in the discourse, moving quickly to a semi-active state, and eventually to an inactive 
state.  The second stage of decay, from semi-active to inactive, is much slower and is generally 
directly proportional to the participant’s salience and level of activity in the preceding discourse.  
Eventually, the participant is said to be ‘inactive’, stored in the reader’s long-term memory, and 
requiring more mental energy to reactivate than a semi-active participant. 
 27
2.2.5 Activation Potential and Participant Encoding 
 Lambrecht rightly notes that the issues of accessibility and activation are less a matter of 
discrete states, and more matters of degree.  “I suggest, then, that we think of cognitive accessibility 
as a POTENTIAL FOR ACTIVATION rather than as the STATE OF A REFERENT in a person’s mind…  I 
believe that the main criterion in manipulating the pragmatic states of referents in a discourse is not 
whether some referent is ‘objectively’ active or inactive in a hearer’s mind but whether a speaker 
assumes that a hearer is willing and able, on the basis of grammatical forms with particular 
presuppositional structures, to draw certain inferences which are necessary to arrive at the correct 
interpretation of a referent” (1994:104-105).  Based on Chafe’s (1987) definitions of activation states, 
and Givón’s (1983a:18) Iconicity Principle, it is possible to sketch the expected morphological forms 
used to encode referents with different potentials for activation. 
 Active participants are normally encoded using the minimal morphological form available in 
a language (cf. Grice’s ‘Maxim of Quantity’, 1975:45-46; Givón 1983a:17-18; Gundel et al. 
1993:278; Lambrecht 1994:96; Huang 2000:220-221).  Language-specific examples of minimum 
encoding for subjects are: zero anaphora in Chinese, Japanese and Korean; clitic or bound pronouns14 
in Biblical Hebrew, Koine Greek and Arabic; and independent pronouns in English, French and 
German.  Though use of more encoding is frequently used to refer to active participants (e.g. a lexical 
NP or a demonstrative pronoun), such encoding is often pragmatically motivated to accomplish non-
default purposes, as was illustrated from Huang (2000:11) in §2.1.2. 
 Givón (2001:175) describes the challenge of reactivation as follows:  “In the grammar of 
referential coherence, a referent is coded as definite when the speaker assumes that it is accessible to 
the hearer but is not currently activated (in working memory/attention).  The hearer’s task is then to 
ground (connect) the referent, either to its previous anaphoric trace in episodic memory or to some 
other accessible trace, and then to reactivate it in working memory”.  Thus the re-establishment of the 
referent and the ‘ground’ (what we will call the discourse anchor or anchoring relation) is the 
primary task accomplished through reactivation from inactivity.  Differences in activation potential 
require different levels of morphological encoding.  
 Semi-active participants require definite lexical NPs for reactivation since they are only 
peripherally conscious in the reader’s mental representation.  These referents are not ‘lit up’, thus a 
lexically-specific form is needed to specify the intended referent and thus reactivate it.  The cognitive 
task is to select the intended participant from among the possible candidates in the reader’s peripheral 
consciousness.  As was the case with active participants, semi-active referents are also overencoded at 
times using anchored definite NPs.  It will be shown that such encoding is pragmatically—and not 
simply semantically—motivated.   
                                                     
14 Givón (1983a:17) refers to such pronouns as ‘agreement markers’. 
 28
 Inactive referents—those which have previously been discourse active but have passed into 
long-term memory due to disuse—have a higher semantic threshold to be met for reactivation.  As a 
result, and based on Givón’s (1983a:18) Iconicity Principle, we can expect that inactive participants 
will require more morphological encoding than semi-active participants.15  Not only must the inactive 
participant be specified using a definite lexical NP, but the anchoring relation which grounds the 
participant to the discourse must also be reestablished.  The anchoring relation can take the form of 
an attributive modifier, a restrictive relative clause, or an appositive.  We propose the following table 
to describe default encoding of the three activation states: 
Table 1. Anticipated Encoding Based on Activation Potential 
ACTIVATION STATES REACTIVATION CONTINUING REFERENCE 
ACTIVE -- CL. OR Ø 
SEMI-ACTIVE SIMPLE NP -- 
INACTIVE ANCHORED NP -- 
 
It stands to reason that there should be a difference in encoding required for reactivation between 
each activation state.  While we may not know definitively the specific activation state of a 
participant in a reader’s mental representation at any one time, we can observe the assessments that 
speakers make about activation status based on how they encode participants in various discourse 
contexts.  Such a working distinction is imperative in order for analysts to make informed judgments 
regarding whether a participant’s encoding is default or marked. 
 Lambrecht’s (1994) regarding the reactivation of inactive referents requires further 
discussion.  Reactivation of a participant from the discourse register essentially requires a shift by the 
reader from knowing about the participant to thinking about the participant as the center of attention.  
Lambrecht claims that the required encoding for reactivating an inactive participant is 
“ACCENTUATION of the referential expression and FULL LEXICAL coding” (1994:96).  His claim 
appears to be based on a corollary assumed from Chafe’s observation that active participants are 
usually “spoken with an attenuated pronunciation” (Chafe 1987:26).  Lambrecht (1994:98) makes the 
assumption that prosody is a marking component of the morphological encoding hierarchy, forming a 
set of contrastive oppositions regarding the encoding of activation states.  The following is 
extrapolated from his discussion: 
• Active: -prosodic prominence, +pronominal encoding 
• Semi-active: +/-prosodic prominence, -pronominal encoding16 
• Inactive (and accessible?):  +prosodic prominence, -pronominal encoding 
                                                     
15 Cf. Givón (1983a:19), where he notes “at least some studies in this volume demonstrate that NPs modified by 
restrictive modifiers code more discontinuous/less accessible topics than unmodified NP’s.  This must be a 
reflection of the phonological size scale, since obviously a modification increases the size of the NP”.  Cf. 
Givón (2001:175ff) for use of restrictive relative clauses to reestablish the ‘grounding’ relation of inactive 
referents. 
16 Our construction of his semi-active position is just that.  It appears that he claims that ‘activation accent’ is 
necessary for the promotion of both inactive and accessible referents (cf. 1994:270). 
 29
 
Lambrecht’s conclusion regarding the function of prosody in the reactivation of inactive participants 
overlooks several very significant aspects of attested encoding data.   
 To begin with, prosody is not a recognized morphological marker in language typology.  The 
nearest thing to the use of prosody in any morphological encoding scale concerns use of independent 
pronouns, never NPs (cf. Givón’s ‘Scale of phonological size’, 1983a:18; or Ariel’s ‘Accessibility 
marking scale’, 1990).17  Both of these scales, as well as the work of Chafe (1976, 1980, 1987), are all 
‘pre-Lambrecht’.  In other words, Lambrecht’s work on information structure significantly influenced 
subsequent discussion on everything from contrastiveness to word order.  Subsequent study of 
prosody has placed its role squarely within the realm of pragmatics, not semantics.18  Within 
pragmatics, prosody is found to be a significant component of information structure, especially in 
languages with rigid word order.  There is indeed a relation between activation state and prosody.  
However we would argue that it concerns the difference between topical and focal information, not 
activation states. 
 By definition, topical entities must be identifiable NPs, either active or accessible to the 
hearer.  Default encoding of topical entities is characterized by attenuated pronunciation (i.e. 
unaccented).  If one correlates topicality with activation state, one finds that by definition only active 
and semi-active participants can be topical.  This would account for their lack of prosodic prominence 
in unmarked information-structure contexts (cf. §2.3).  Thus, ‘prosodic accent’ serves as a distinctive 
marker of information status: a constituent is either topical or focal.  We argue here that the case 
cannot be made typologically for its application as a distinctive marker of activation state.  Consider 
the distinction between ‘stressed pronoun’ and ‘unstressed pronoun’ in Ariel’s scale.  From a 
pragmatic standpoint, the distinction between the two is marked topic versus default topic, 
respectively, since pronominal referents must be discourse-active by definition.19
 Next, consider Lambrecht’s definition of focal constituents.  He defines the focus of an 
utterance as the difference between what is presupposed at the time of the utterance, and what is 
                                                     
17 Givón uses the term ‘unstressed pronoun’ as a synonym for a clitic or bound pronoun.  He correspondingly 
links stressed pronouns with independent pronouns, presumably to differentiate languages like English (which 
do not use clitic pronouns) from languages such as Hebrew (which do).  Ariel’s scale seems to list all 
possibilities for all languages: 
Ariel’s accessibility marking scale (from Huang 2000:254) 
Zero > reflexive > agreement marker > cliticized pronoun > unstressed pronoun > stressed pronoun > 
stressed pronoun+gesture > proximal demonstrative (+NP) > distal demonstrative (+NP) > … > first 
name > last name >short definite description > long definite description > full name 
Though she may indeed see a scalar function of prosody with respect to pronouns, no scale uses ‘stressed NP’ as 
a morphological class relating to activation. 
18 Cf. Hedberg (2002), and Hedberg and Sosa (2001). 
19 A technical exception to pronouns being topical is the prospective or cataphoric use of demonstrative 
pronouns to highlight the introduction of a new proposition.  E.g., “Know this, that you will never pass the 
course without studying”.  In this example, the referent of ‘this’ is the proposition “that you…”  So far as we 
have been able to determine, such prospective uses of pronouns are resolved in the immediate context, and thus 
still follow the general principle claimed here regarding use of pronouns. 
 30
asserted in the utterance.  By definition, inactive participants from the discourse register are construed 
as non-topical, and therefore are considered part of the focal domain at their reactivation.  Lambrecht 
himself makes this point several times: 
Different syntactic constraints on the coding of inactive and accessible referents have been 
observed by Prince (1981a)20 and Chafe (1987), who both conclude on the basis of text 
counts that the vast majority of subjects in spoken English have active or accessible but not 
inactive referents (1994:100-101). 
 
It is clear that any claim concerning a correlation between focus and cognitive state ‘inactive’ 
can be made only for focus constituents to which the activation parameter can be applied, i.e. 
to referential constituents in the sense of Section 3.1 (ibid:260). 
 
Focus and inactiveness are independent information-structure parameters and their 
grammatical manifestations must be carefully distinguished (ibid:261). 
 
The theoretical observation that pragmatically inaccessible discourse referents are most likely 
to be coded as focal constituents is strongly confirmed by statistical observations concerning 
the distribution of topic and focus constituents in texts.  For example the text counts from 
spoken French presented in Lambrecht 1986b (Chapter 6) reveal that subjects 
overwhelmingly tend to be pronouns while objects overwhelmingly appear as lexical noun 
phrases.  Given the necessary correlation between pronominal coding and activeness on the 
one hand and between inactiveness and lexical coding on the other (Chapter 3), and given the 
correlation between subject and topic on the one hand and object and focus on the other 
(Chapter 4), we can conclude that there must be a strong discourse tendency for referential 
focus constituents to have ‘new’ referents.  And this tendency may have important 
consequences for the syntactic structuring of sentences.  Nevertheless, there is no necessary 
correlation between focus and activation states of referents (ibid:262). 
 
We completely agree with Lambrecht that focus must be understood as the difference between that 
which is presupposed and that which is asserted.  Having said this, we believe that the relation that he 
is observing is the pragmatic marking of information structure, not the use of prosody as a distinctive 
marker of activation.  By definition, focal constituents are marked by prosodic prominence, and any 
extension of prosody as a distinctive marker of activation states seems circumstantial at best. 
 There is one final point to make regarding Lambrecht’s account of reactivation of discourse-
register participants.  We claimed above that reactivation of inactive participants requires both a 
definite lexical NP and some kind anchoring relation that reestablishes the participant’s relation to the 
discourse.  This is most frequently accomplished via appositives, restrictive relative clauses, or 
possessive pronouns whose anaphor is discourse-active.  Lambrecht does not provide many different 
examples of such reactivation, but each of the ones he cites includes has an anchoring expression.  
Lambrecht capitalizes words to indicate that they receive primary sentence accent: 
a) I heard something TERRIBLE last night.  (Ø) remember MARK, the guy we went HIKING 
with (Ø), who’s GAY?  His LOVER just died of AIDS (ibid:119). 
                                                     
20 Prince only cites one ‘new’ (unused) token occurring as a subject.  It is the opening clause of a paper, and 
likely utilizes pragmatic bootstrapping for activation: “The late Uriel Weinreich (1966:399) observed…” 
(1981:247). 
 31
b) My CAR broke down (in answer to the question, ‘What happened?’) (ibid:16). 
c) Her HUSBAND died (ibid:309). 
d) I saw your BROTHER yesterday (ibid:107). 
e) I finally met the WOMAN who moved in downstairs (ibid:51).21  
Token (a) provides an example of the speaker asking the hearer to recall a participant from his/her 
shared knowledge.  Lambrecht construes both MARK and AIDS as being inactive, and attributes the 
accenting to their reactivation.  We would agree that MARK is inactive, but we attribute the accent to 
marking both as focal.  AIDS is accessible from world knowledge, and thus requires no anchor.  
Notice that the reactivation of MARK includes two anchoring expressions to ensure that the hearer 
reactivates the correct MARK (i.e. ‘the guy we went HIKING with (Ø)’ and ‘who’s GAY’).  Accent 
alone, without any anchoring expression, would almost certainly be insufficient to successfully 
reactivate the correct referent MARK in the hearer’s mental representation. 
 Tokens (b) and (c) are activating new but contextually-accessible participants in what 
Lambrecht calls ‘event-reporting’ sentences which do not have topics.  Note that each accented NP 
includes a discourse anchor to relate the NP to the discourse context.  The anchor renders it at least 
cognitively accessible to the hearer (i.e. ‘My’ with CAR in (b), ‘Her’ with HUSBAND in (c)).  
Exclusion of the anchoring expressions would completely change the referential meaning of each 
clause (except perhaps (b)), because the hearer would not be able to uniquely identify the speaker-
intended referent.  The anchor disambiguates the referring expression, marking that it reactivates a 
specific participant from the discourse register and not a brand-new participant.  Tokens (d) and (e) 
reactivate participants from the shared discourse register via the comment of a topic/comment 
sentence.  The anchoring relations in these sentences provide the same disambiguating function, 
indicating that the speaker is reactivating a known entity from the discourse register.  On this basis we 
consider prosody to correlate to information structure, and anchoring relations to correlate with 
activation status.  The claim that Lambrecht has made correlating prosody to activation state 
overlooks the role of the anchoring relation, and becomes untenable when this relation is removed 
from the context. 
2.2.6 Identifiability and the ‘Givenness Hierarchy’ 
 Gundel et al. (1993) have developed a more nuanced scale of activation, and one which is 
linked to the specific forms which grammaticalize each level, called the “Givenness Hierarchy”.  
Table 2 represents our application of their Hierarchy to Biblical Hebrew and Koine Greek.   
 
 
 
                                                     
21 Cf. Lambrecht’s (1994:130) comments on restrictive relative clauses often marking the head noun as focal.  
Cf. p. 165 and his ‘Topic acceptability scale’, which predicts that topic acceptability decreases as one moves 
down the following list:  active, accessible, unused, brand-new anchored, brand-new unanchored.

Gundel et al. (1993) have found that the Givenness Hierarchy forms an entailment scheme in which 
the lower levels of activation are entailed in the higher levels.  Thus, if a participant is activated, it is 
by definition also familiar, uniquely identifiable, referential and type identifiable.  A list of definitions 
for the various levels follows: 
Type identifiable:  “Able to access a representation of the object” (ibid:276). 
Referential:  “The speaker intends to refer to a particular object or objects...must either 
retrieve an existing representation…or construct a new one” (ibid:276). 
Uniquely identifiable:  “The addressee can identify the speaker’s intended referent on the 
basis of the nominal alone” (ibid:277). 
Familiar:  “Is able to uniquely identify the intended referent because he already has a 
representation of it in memory”, either long- or short-term (ibid:278). 
Activated:  “Represented in current short-term memory” (ibid:278).  Either retrieved from 
long-term memory, or constructed from immediate context. 
In focus:  “Not only in short-term memory, but also at the current center of attention” 
(ibid:278). 
Their model is discussed in more detail in the description of thematic and cataphoric highlighting in 
Chapter 6.  With regard to the discussion of Lambrecht above, note that description of pronouns as 
‘stressed’ and ‘unstressed’ by Gundel et al. (1993) follows Givón’s (1983a) explanation.  
2.3 Information-Structuring Framework 
2.3.1 Pragmatic Presupposition, Topic and Focus 
 Information structure is the analysis of how speakers pair the propositions which they wish to 
communicate with the most appropriate lexico-grammatical structure, based on their assumptions 
about the hearer’s mental representation and the speaker’s own communicative goals.  Thus “the 
information structure of a sentence is the formal expression of the pragmatic structuring of a 
proposition in a discourse” (Lambrecht 1994:6).  As speakers communicate new propositions to 
22 Added to reflect common translation of referential indefinites in Biblical Hebrew and Koine Greek. 
 33
hearers, the information becomes presupposed for both speaker and hearer, and will form the topical 
basis of new assertions which follow.   
 Most utterances can be divided into two parts:  that which is presupposed, and that which is 
asserted.  The presupposed information forms the basis from which topical entities of a clause are 
drawn, while the asserted information is classified as focal.  Regarding topic Lambrecht states, “A 
referent is interpreted as the topic of a proposition if in a given situation the proposition is construed 
as being about this referent, i.e. as expressing information which is relevant to and which increases 
the addressee’s knowledge of this referent” (ibid:131).  He defines focus as “the element of 
information whereby the presupposition and the assertion DIFFER from each other.  The focus is that 
portion of a proposition which cannot be taken for granted at the time of speech.  It is the 
unpredictable or pragmatically NON-RECOVERABLE element in an utterance.  The focus is what 
makes an utterance into an assertion” (ibid: 207).  For convenience sake in illustrations, bold font will 
be used to identify focal constituents, while underlining will be used to identify topical constituents. 
2.3.2 Sentence Articulations 
 There are three basic types of sentence articulation (i.e. pragmatic structures) identified by 
Lambrecht (ibid:117ff; cf. Andrews 1985:77ff) which each accomplish a different pragmatic function.  
Each articulation presupposes different aspects of a proposition.  The predicate focus articulation 
(also called topic-comment) presupposes that a topic X did something, and is used to answer the 
question, “What did X do?”  For instance, if someone saw me sucking my thumb, the following 
question-answer set might be used. 
(1) Question:  “What happened to you?”  
Answer:  “I just hit my thumb with a hammer!”  
 
The question presupposes that ‘I’ did something.  The answer takes the presupposed topic (‘I’) and 
makes a propositional comment about it (‘hit my thumb with a hammer’).  The focus of the utterance 
is the predicate of the clause (Lambrecht 1994:222).  Predicate focus is the default sentence 
articulation, the one used when there is no pragmatic reason to use another.  Subjects encoded as 
clitic/unaccented pronouns are prototypically found in predicate focus clauses. 
 A second sentence articulation is argument focus (also called focus-presupposition).  In this 
articulation, the proposition is presupposed by both the speaker and hearer, but the argument which 
makes the presupposition into an assertion is missing.  The question and answer set changes to: 
(2) Question:  “What did you hit?” or “What did you hit your thumb with?”  
Answer:  “I just hit my thumb with a hammer” or “I just hit my thumb with a hammer.”  
Elided answer:  “My thumb” or “A hammer.”  
 
Notice that the argument focus answer is identical to the predicate focus answer with the exception of 
the prosodic stress on the arguments ‘thumb’ or ‘hammer’.  The primary difference between these 
utterances lies in what is presupposed in each.  The argument focus answer can use a default 
 34
constituent order as in (2), the elided answer, or use an It-cleft construction to achieve a marked 
constituent order for more pragmatic highlighting than the default answers in (2). 
(3) Marked Answer:  “It was my thumb that I just hit with a hammer.” 
English must utilize it-clefts to obtain marked focus constructions due to its rigid constituent order.  
Languages such as Biblical Hebrew and Koine Greek allow pragmatic shifts in constituent order, and 
thus will manifest more frequent use of marked orders. 
 The third sentence articulation is presentational articulation or sentence focus (Lambrecht 
1994:222).  The primary function of sentence focus is “to introduce an entity whose semantic role is 
normally expressed with the subject function” (Andrews 1985:80; cf. Lambrecht 1994:39).  The 
sentence focus clause does not contain presupposed information.  The focus of sentence focus clauses 
is the entire clause.  Typically a newly introduced argument will be the subject of a verb which 
predicates existence (e.g. ‘Once there was an X…’), a verb of motion (e.g. ‘suddenly three men 
approached the camp’), or a verb of perception (e.g. ‘A rabbit appeared from inside the magician’s 
hat’) (cf. Lambrecht 1994:137ff; Dooley and Levinsohn 2001:63ff).  No comment is made about the 
focal argument in the main clause, though a subordinate relative-type-clause can be used for this 
purpose (Andrews 1985:80), illustrated in (4).   
(4) Once there was a carpenter who had a hammer. 
‘A carpenter’ is presented (and thus activated) into the discourse, and the subordinate relative clause 
assigns a comment to the new participant.  Sentence focus clauses are a standard means of beginning 
a new discourse.  
 Lambrecht identifies an apparent sub-group within sentence focus clauses which he calls 
event reporting (1994:137).  Event reporting sentences answer the question “What happened?” and 
the whole clause is considered to be in focus, not just the newly presented argument.  Lambrecht 
notes that “in English the difference between event-reporting and predicate focus sentences is not 
[always] unambiguously marked” (ibid:137).  The distinction lies in the presupposed proposition of 
each articulation:  there is no presupposed information in a sentence focus or event-reporting clause. 
(5) Event-reporting    Predicate focus  
Question:  “What happened?”  “What did you do to your thumb?”  
Answer:  “My thumb was hit!”  “It was hit.”  
 
Although there are only three primary sentence articulations, there are multitudes of ways to adapt 
them to meet a speaker’s pragmatic communicative goals.  
2.3.3 Pragmatic Ordering of Constituents 
 While this study does not focus on information structure, the various pragmatic structuring 
devices directly impact the default minimum encoding of participants.  Therefore, we will provide a 
brief overview of constituent-ordering principles and conventions.  As noted above, there are 
basically two pragmatic classifications for the information in an utterance:  that which is presupposed 
 35
or topical, and that which is asserted or focal.  According to the principle of Natural Information Flow 
(Comrie 1989:127-28), the default tendency is for a speaker to structure an utterance so as to move 
from what is most known to what is least known, to the degree that the word-order typology of the 
language allows.   
 The following is an adapted summary of the default constituent order of nuclear clauses in 
Biblical Hebrew, based on Lode (1984) and Levinsohn (2000b): 
(6) Default or Least-Marked Ordering of Nuclear Clause Constituents 
Verb—Pronominals23—Subject—Objects/Complements—Adjuncts  
This ordering scheme applies to finite verbal clauses, and represents what we construe as default 
ordering of the possible constituents; not all are required.  In the case of non-finite verbal and verbless 
clauses, Buth (1999:107) has claimed the default order of nuclear clause constituents to be Subject-
Predicate, though the ordering of constituents within the predicate is not specifically discussed.  Our 
ordering of pre-nuclear constituents, described below, is consistent with Buth’s model for verbless 
clauses.   
 Most verbless clauses from our corpora occur within the reported speeches of the narrative.  
The encoding of participants in such clauses manifests very little variation that is not accounted for 
either by our default encoding rules or by the principles of information structure.  As will be shown in 
Chapters 5 and 6, most pragmatic conventions of participant reference necessitate the overencoding 
of participants.  The minimum encoding requirements of verbless clauses are high enough as to 
render unambiguous cases of overencoding very rare.  Thus, application of the claims made below 
regarding the overencoding of participants for discourse processing or cataphoric highlighting could 
only be made to such verbless or non-finite tokens manifesting demonstrable overencoding.  We 
found this difficult to claim in most cases.  Conversely, the principles describing thematic 
highlighting in Chapter 6 apply equally well to verbless and non-finite verbless clauses, and thus do 
not merit special attention.  Finite verbal clauses contain the bulk of encoding data which cannot be 
accounted for either by default encoding principles or by principles of information structure. As a 
result, the encoding of participants in finite verbal clauses will necessarily receive the bulk of our 
attention.   
 As noted above, pragmatic ordering of constituents regularly occurs in Biblical Hebrew, 
prototypically by fronting or preposing the marked constituent before the finite verb.  Preposed focal 
constituents will be referred to as PFCs.  The pragmatic effect of preposing a focal constituent is to 
                                                     
23 ‘Pronominals’ refers to any pronominal form, be it a deictic or demonstrative, a pronominal suffix bound to a 
preposition or the object marker, etc.  In practice, ‘pronominals’ also primarily refers to non-subject pronouns.  
The default subject pronoun of finite verbs in Biblical Hebrew is a clitic or ‘verb-agreement’ pronoun (cf. Givón 
1983a), and is encoded in the verb morphology.  The use of independent subject pronouns is therefore construed 
as pragmatically motivated in narrative, and thus these pronouns prototypically occur in pragmatically marked 
positions.  As a result, the category ‘Subject’ functionally refers to lexical NPs.  For the post-verbal use of 
subject pronouns, cf. BHRG §36.1.I.2.ii. 
 36
lend greater prominence to the preposed constituent than it would otherwise receive in its default 
position.  The speaker could have placed the constituent in default position, but chose instead to 
prepose it; therefore the choice implies a meaning. 
 Presupposed, topical information can also be preposed, but serves quite a different pragmatic 
function.  Fronted topical constituents will be referred to as ‘points of departure’ (PoDs), following 
Levinsohn (2000a). 24  A PoD “cohesively anchors the subsequent clause(s) to something which is 
already in the context (i.e., to something accessible in the hearer’s mental representation)…  It is 
backward-looking, in the sense of locating the anchoring place within the existing mental 
representation, but it is forward-looking in that it is the subsequent part of the sentence which is 
anchored in that place” (Dooley and Levinsohn 2001:68).  In other words, PoDs provide a marked, 
pragmatic means of highlighting discontinuity, with the PoD forming the primary basis for relating 
what follows the PoD with what has preceded it.25  A PoD is considered pragmatically marked 
because the information it contains could also be conveyed from its default position in the clause, but 
the writer/speaker has chosen to prepose it and thus mark the discontinuity.  The following pragmatic 
ordering scheme is based on Dooley and Levinsohn (ibid:68) and Buth (1999:107): 
(7) Left-Dislocated—PoD—PFC—Nuclear Clause—Right-Dislocated 
If all constituents are present, (7) would represent the expected ordering.  Note also that more than 
one constituent at a time can be preposed, and the ordering within the PoD slot is expected to be 
based on saliency, with the most salient occurring first. 
  Levinsohn identifies three primary kinds of PoD, based on Givón's (1984:43) discontinuity 
categories of time, place, action and participants. 
(8) Levinsohn’s Categories for Points of Departure (cf. Levinsohn 2000a:7-28) 
(a) Temporal: a preposed adverbial phrase which establishes the temporal frame of reference for 
what follows; 
• Marked:  ‘After he smashed his finger, the carpenter let out a loud shriek of pain.’ 
• Default:  ‘The carpenter let out a shriek of pain after he smashed his finger.’  
 
(b) Spatial: a preposed locative expression (e.g. a prepositional phrase), which establishes the 
spatial frame of reference for what follows; 
• Marked:  ‘At the hospital, the medic bandaged the carpenter’s mangled finger.’ 
• Default:  ‘The medic bandaged the carpenter’s mangled finger at the hospital.’  
 
(c) Referential: a preposed nominal or prepositional phrase (or in English, receiving secondary 
sentence accent) which establishes a new topic, usually by switch from a previous topic.  
These can be accomplished in several ways in English; 
                                                     
24 These constituents are also called ‘topicalized’ (cf. BHRG) or ‘contextualizing constituents’ (cf. Buth 1999), 
but the terminology of Levinsohn will be maintained here. 
25 Cf. Li and Thompson’s discussion on the notion of topic, and the rationale for fronting a constituent to 
establish a specific frame for what follows.  They observe that subjects in subject-prominent languages (e.g., 
English, Greek, Hebrew or German) are weak topics, as compared to topics in topic-prominent languages.   
According to their research, the topic in a topic prominent language is always sentence initial (1976:465).  The 
means they found for strengthening a subject, to make it more topical in a subject-prominent language, was by 
fronting it to a marked initial position such as using a spacer or left-dislocation (1979:484). 
 37
• Left-dislocated:  ‘As for his finger, it was quite disfigured.’ 
• Prosodic marking: ‘His thumb was unhurt; however, his finger was quite disfigured.’ 
• Use of spacer:  ‘His thumb was unhurt; his finger, however, was quite disfigured.’ 
• Default:  ‘His finger was quite disfigured.’  
Other kinds of PoDs found predominately in non-narrative discourse include: 
(d) Renewal: returns to a previous topic; 
(e) Conditional: preposed conditional clause such as, ‘If you don’t stop talking, I will…’ 
(f) Purpose:  ‘In order that this doesn’t happen again, you should…’ 
(g) Reason:  ‘Because of your dedicated work, we have decided to…’  
 
It is important to keep in mind the pragmatic intentions that each of these phrases represent.  A 
speaker could have encoded each clause using default word-order or default prosody.  Instead a 
marked means was chosen, ostensibly to accomplish some pragmatic effect.  
 As noted earlier, the pragmatic ordering of constituents occurs fairly regularly in Biblical 
Hebrew narrative.  Finite verbs in Biblical Hebrew do not require explicit subjects, but are able to 
encode the subject agreement information using bound, clitic pronouns.  Some direct objects can also 
be encoded using enclitic pronouns on the verb.  Since movement of the constituent is necessary to 
signal either a referential PoD or a PFC (i.e. argument focus), the minimal unbound encoding of 
referents in Biblical Hebrew is an independent pronoun.  For instance, the choice to make a 
constituent a PoD or PFC requires that the minimum encoding of the participant be an independent 
pronoun, and therefore there is no meaning behind the choice to encode the participant using an 
independent pronoun other than the creation of a PoD or PFC.  The independent pronoun plays a 
disambiguating function in Biblical Hebrew, explicitly indicating the presence of a marked 
information structure that would have remained unmarked using bound morphological forms.  This 
issue will be discussed in much more detail in Chapter 4.
2.4 Cross-Linguistic Functions of Participant Reference 
2.4.1 Introduction   
 Dooley and Levinsohn (2001:112) have identified three linguistic functions a participant 
reference system must be capable of accomplishing:  
• Semantic:  “identify the referents unambiguously, distinguishing them from other 
possible ones”.  In other words, the reader must be able to track ‘who did what to whom’ 
(cf. Andrews 1985:66, Givón 1983a, 1983b, A Fox 1983).  
• Processing:  “overcome disruptions in the flow of information” (cf. Fox 1987a, 1987b, 
Tomlin 1987, Levinsohn 2000b),  
Discourse-pragmatic:  “signal the activation status and prominence of the referents or the 
actions they perform” (cf. Andrews 1985:77ff, Huang 2000:213ff, Levinsohn 2000a:140). 
These three functions are not discrete categories.  We claim they form a hierarchical entailment 
scheme.  Encoding for processing still accomplishes a semantic task, even if the encoding is 
redundant.  Similarly, pragmatic encoding entails processing and semantic functions as well.  The 
converse does not hold true, though.  The significance of viewing these functions as entailing one 
 38
another will be treated much more fully in our discussion of pragmatic functions of participant 
reference in chapter 6. 
(9) Entailment Hierarchy of Cross-Linguistic Functions of Participant Reference 
Discourse-pragmatic entails Processing which entails Semantic 
 In §2.4.1, a brief description of each of the three functions will be presented in order to 
provide a framework for understanding the kinds of conventions languages use to encode participant 
reference information.  In sections 2.4.2-2.4.4, we will review the three major quantitative 
methodologies which have been brought to bear in the description of participant reference in various 
languages (viz. Givón 1983, Tomlin 1987, and Levinsohn 1994, 2000a, 2000b).  Each methodology 
has benefited from those which preceded, building on the previous conclusions and seeking to explain 
the remaining counter-examples and anomalies.  Each study has a particular emphasis, which 
coincidentally parallels the three purposes of participant reference hypothesized by Dooley and 
Levinsohn (2001).  Therefore, the three purposes will provide the outline for the sections.   
 In light of the existence of three, essentially competing methodologies for describing 
participant reference, a study was undertaken by Clark (2000) to apply these three approaches to the 
Sio language of Papua New Guinea.  His goal was to determine which method most “accurately and 
thoroughly” described the Sio participant reference system, including apparent deviant usage 
(ibid:ix).   Clark provides an evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of each method in 
participant reference description, and his assessments will be incorporated in our discussion below. 
The Semantic Function 
   The semantic task of participant reference is primarily focused on ensuring that the reader is 
able to track the roles, and shifts in roles, of each participant in the discourse.  The most common 
strategy of participant reference is a sequential strategy,26 whereby “the reference of [other than a full 
noun phrase] is normally taken from the nearest candidate word before it” (Grimes 1978:viii).27  The 
candidate word is the antecedent that most agrees with the anaphor by grammatical categories such as 
gender or number, by animacy, and based on the semantics of the context.   
 Use of full lexical encoding for continuing reference to participants would theoretically be the 
most unambiguous means of encoding participants.  However, principles such as Grice’s (1975) 
‘Maxim of Quantity,’ Foley and Van Valin’s (1980:270ff) ‘Interclausal Relations Hierarchy,’ and 
Givón’s (1983a:18) ‘Iconicity principle,’ assert that speakers tend to use the minimal level of 
encoding available for continuing reference.  Speakers rely upon the conventions of the sequential-
strategy system as the primary means of indicating continuity in the discourse.  In a closed setting, 
where only one or two participants are involved, tracking participants encoded using minimal 
                                                     
26 For other strategies of anaphora, cf. Huang (2000:1-8). 
27 Cf. Fox’s (1987a:158) comments regarding the cross-linguistic evidence affirming the prevalent use of 
sequential strategies. 
 39
reference is usually accomplished quite easily, even when the participants change roles.  Consider the 
English translation of Exodus 4:2-3 for example: 
(10) Semantic function of participant reference encoding 
(a) And the LORD1 said to him2 [Moses], "What is that3 in your hand?"  
(b) And he2 said, "A staff3." 
(c) Then He1 said, "Throw it3 on the ground."  
(d) So he2 threw it3 on the ground,  
(e) and it3 became a serpent4;  
(f) and Moses2 fled from it4.  
Once the participants are explicitly mentioned in (a), four changes of subject/agent are unambiguously 
accomplished using only minimal morphological encoding.  Even if we had not added a lexical NP in 
(a) to specify participant2, the reader still could have distinctly tracked the participants.  In (f), a 
lexical NP has been introduced to clarify who flees from the serpent, since there are two possible 
antecedents for ‘he’. 
 Clauses (a)-(c) are considered a closed context, since there are only two participants in the 
context, and their role changes can often be accomplished unambiguously with minimal encoding. In 
open contexts (clauses (d)-(f)), where more than two participants are involved, minimal encoding 
becomes less of an option, and lexical NPs are more frequently used to encode switches of 
participants in order to avoid ambiguity.  Dooley and Levinsohn note that “the amount of coding 
material in a referring expression increases with the danger of ambiguity” (2001:113, italics theirs).  
They also note that quite often encoding one participant with a lexical NP is sufficient to 
disambiguate a context as seen in (11a) and (11f) above. 
The Processing Function 
 The processing task has to do with how readers assimilate a text into a mental representation.  
Where there are discontinuities or disruptions in the text (such as those described in Givón's 
Discontinuity scale above), more specific encoding is expected.  Thus, one expects that default, 
minimal encoding of participants is interpreted by the reader as signaling ‘+continuity’.28  The 
corollary holds as well: disruptions in the discourse will require more encoding.  Dooley and 
Levinsohn (2001:113) claim that such disruptions are found at thematic boundaries, or where there is 
discontinuity of action (such as transitions from event material to non-event material).  Such 
disruptions guide the reader in how to segment the discourse into meaningful thematic units in the 
form of a mental representation.  Thus, the processing task is not so much semantic as cognitive, 
helping the reader to recognize where a discrete segment of a mental representation should end and 
another should begin.  There is good reason for breaking a discourse down into smaller, more 
manageable pieces. 
                                                     
28 Cf. Nariyama (2000), who essentially argues that minimal encoding in Japanese, viz. ellipsis of an argument, 
is the ‘unmarked representation of “sameness”’.  We understand her claim to mean ‘+continuity’ of participant.  
Evidence from other languages would suggest that this principle applies far beyond Japanese alone. 
 40
 Paivio and Begg claim that humans do not process discourses as an unbroken chain, but 
instead break it into smaller mental chunks: “A chunk functions as a unit of memory, so that we can 
remember about the same number of chunks regardless of how many lower-order units are used in 
their construction” (1981:176).  According to this view, humans practice a form of ‘cognitive 
segmentation’29 in order to facilitate greater comprehension and retention of discourse content.  Just as 
a play is broken down into acts, and acts are broken down into scenes, etc., humans can also 
hierarchically chunk discourse content into a series of recursively embedded units.   
 Levinsohn (2000a, 2000b) has demonstrated that the particle de is used in Koine Greek as a 
processing tool.  It segments segment the text into what he calls ‘development units’; Follingstad 
(1994) has demonstrated that the developmental marker kàn in Tyap has a comparable function.  
Similarly, English typically utilizes adverbs such as ‘then’ or ‘next’ to chunk discourse.  The 
following example is an abridged NASB version of the ordination rite recorded in Leviticus 8.  Notice 
the use of then and next by the translator to segment the larger process into macro chunks, with the 
PoDs marking discontinuity within the chunk. 
(11) Processing Markers in the English Translation of Leviticus 8:5-23 
(a) Ø  Moses said… 
(b) Then MOSES had …and washed…And he put…and girded…and clothed…and put…and he 
girded… 
(c) He then placed…  Ø He also placed…and on the turban…he placed... 
(d) MOSES then took… and anointed…and consecrated…And he sprinkled…and anointed… 
(e) Then he poured…and anointed… 
(f) Next MOSES had…and clothed…and girded…and bound… 
(g) Then he brought…and Aaron and his sons laid… 
(h) Next Moses slaughtered…and took…and with his finger put…and purified… 
(i) Then he poured out…and consecrated…  Ø He also took…and MOSES offered…But the 
bull…, he burned… 
(j) Then he presented…and Aaron and his sons laid…And Moses slaughtered…and sprinkled…  
Ø When he had cut the ram into its pieces, MOSES offered…  Ø After he had washed the 
entrails and the legs with water, MOSES offered up… 
(k) Then he presented…and Aaron and his sons laid…And Moses slaughtered…and took…and 
put… 
Since none of the adverbs are present in the Hebrew text, their presence in the English translation 
illustrates the translator’s desire to segment the text into smaller units, breaking the steps into sub-
steps.   
 Next, consider the pragmatic effect of overencoding ‘Moses’ where Moses was the subject of 
the preceding clause.  The ‘MOSES’ encodings, which are in the Hebrew text, illustrate the role the 
participant reference system plays in providing direction to the reader about how to process the 
                                                     
29 We intentionally avoid the term ‘paragraphing’ to describe this phenomenon, as this term is more of a literary 
convention as opposed to a linguistic or cognitive one.  There is little doubt that languages chunk, but there 
appear to be different preferences among languages as to the preferred length of chunks (cf. Clancy 1980:155-
159 for a comparison of preferred lengths of sentences and chunks in English compared to Japanese).  We prefer 
the more generic terms ‘chunk’ or ‘segment’ in order to avoid the importation of English preferences into 
Biblical Hebrew. 
 41
discourse.  Two occur following the complex temporal PoDs in (j), likely to aid the reader in 
transitioning back to the main narrative line.  Four uses of MOSES occur at thematic transition points:  
in (b) at the transition from reported speech back to narrative, in (d) following the preparation and 
clothing of Aaron, in (f) following the anointing and consecration, and in (h) after the completion of 
clothing Aaron’s sons, but before beginning the processes of the sacrifices.  This redundant use of a 
lexical NP as a processing tool will be fully explored in Chapter 4 below.  It remains to be seen how 
faithful the NASB development units are to those development units in the Hebrew text, but this 
example nonetheless illustrates the propensity of speakers and writers to segment discourse content 
into manageable chunks for readers and hearers to process. 
The Discourse-Pragmatic Function 
 Not every participant is encoded the same way; even the encoding of the same participant can 
vary significantly from one clause to the next.  Factors influencing such encoding decisions involve 
the participant’s activation state, the participant’s salience to the discourse, and the salience of the 
events themselves.  Generally speaking, “the higher the activation status, the less encoding material is 
necessary” (Dooley and Levinsohn 2001:113).  We will discuss Huang’s revision of Levinson’s neo-
Gricean pragmatic implicatures in §2.5, but one principle will be introduced now:  the M-principle.   
 The M-principle is broken into the Speaker’s maxim and the recipient’s corollary: 
(12) Levinson’s Gricean M-principle (Levinson 1987) 
(a) Speaker’s maxim:  Do not use a prolix, obscure or marked expression without reason. 
(b) Recipient’s corollary:  If the speaker used a prolix or marked expression M, he or she did not 
mean the same as he or she would have had he or she used the unmarked expression U—
specifically he or she was trying to avoid the stereotypical associations and I-implicatures of 
U (Huang 2000:207-208).  
The M-principle predicts that a marked form will be understood by the reader as intending to convey 
some meaning other than that communicated by the default or expected form.  Both underspecified 
and overspecified encodings are utilized to accomplish various pragmatic effects.  Omission of the M-
principle from an account of participant reference will impact the results of a study just as 
significantly as an improperly postulated default (cf. Clark 2000:44). 
Salience of the Participant 
 Not all participants are equally salient to a discourse.  Some will play a more prominent role, 
and others are simply props to move the plot forward.  Correlations have been observed between type 
of activation, type of primary referring expression, and the amount of default encoding.  Such factors 
aid the reader in differentiating the most salient participants from those that are secondary.  Major 
participants are more apt to receive “a formal introduction,” which Dooley and Levinsohn describe as 
“linguistic material that instructs the hearer not only to activate the participant, but also to be prepared 
to organize a major part of the mental representation around him or her” (2001:119).  ‘Linguistic 
materials’ include use of a marked expression such as a presentational articulation or a referential 
 42
point of departure for activation.  Minor participants and props (cf. Berlin 1983:23ff) on the other 
hand, are more likely activated as an anchored (and thereby accessible) topic in a topic/comment 
articulation.  A topic/comment clause can quickly establish a relation between the new participant and 
some grounding aspect in the reader’s mental representation of the discourse.  Furthermore, the major 
participant in a discourse is usually also the center of reference to which other participants are related 
or ‘anchored’.30  Use of such conventions is language-specific.  The point to be made here is that the 
choices for activating and relating new participants to the discourse have meaning, usually regarding 
their status and saliency to the discourse. 
 Differentiation of participant status is also observed in the kind of encoding used for 
continuing reference to active participants (cf. Maibaum 1978, Toba 1978, Levinsohn 1978, 1994, 
2000a).  Dooley and Levinsohn note that many languages make distinctions in the encoding of 
participants based on their importance to and role in a discourse (2001:119ff).  This distinction is 
manifested in several ways.  A unique NP is usually ‘assigned’ to the participant at the initial 
activation of a participant.  This unique expression facilitates the ease and accuracy with which the 
hearer is able to identify the speaker-intended participant.  We will call such NPs primary referring 
expressions.  Revell (1996:44) identifies two kinds of primary referring expression in Biblical 
Hebrew:  proper nouns and ‘epithets’.  An epithet is a definite NP, such as ‘the baker’ or ‘the 
survivor’, which type-identifies a specific participant and serves as their primary referring expression.  
Participants with proper names are more likely to function as major participants than those referred to 
with epithets.31  
 Another means for differentiating major and minor participants is the amount of encoding 
used for continuing reference to an active participant.  Based on Givón's ‘Iconicity Principle’, one 
would intuitively expect that activation status and participant encoding would be inversely 
proportional; however, this is not always the case.  For example, Levinsohn describes what he calls a 
VIP strategy (very important participant) based on Grimes’ concept of ‘thematic participant’.  “One 
referent is distinguished from the rest when introduced, and a special set of terms refer to it no matter 
how many other things have been mentioned more recently” (Grimes 1978:viii).  The VIP marker can 
be a specific linguistic sign attached to the participant’s referring expression, or simply the use of 
underspecification.  The latter convention is observed in Koine Greek (cf. Levinsohn 2000a:136), 
Mambila (cf. Perrin 1978:110), Sio (Clark 2000:75), and at ostensibly at various points in Biblical 
                                                     
30  E.g. expressions such as ‘Sarah, Abraham’s wife’ and ‘Lot, Abraham’s nephew’ both point to ‘Abraham’ as 
being the central participant.  Thus, shifts such as ‘Abraham, Sarah’s husband’ would also convey a shift in the 
central participant to ‘Sarah’, even if it is only temporary (cf. §6.3.2). 
31 It is important to recognize that in many languages, non-human participants are referred to using epithets.  
These epithets often end up functioning essentially as a proper name, such as when an animal is personified.  
One finds this kind of phenomenon in the Warner Brothers cartoons about ‘the coyote’ and ‘the road runner’.  
The expression ‘the road runner’ is uniquely referential to a specific participant. 
 43
Hebrew (cf. Revell 1996:65).  We cite an example of VIP encoding provided by Dooley and 
Levinsohn (2001:119) below: 
(13) “The Hare and the Dog” with VIP Strategy: 
(a) ‘One day the hare went and talked with the dog-X. 
(b) The hare told X, “Fry one of your pups for us to eat!” 
(c) X refused. 
(d) The hare asked X, “Why won’t you fry it?” 
(e) X answered, “...”’ 
The linguistic marker represented by X is used to indicate that the dog is the VIP of the story, and this 
marker is used as an abbreviated lexical referring expression in lieu of the prototypical lexical NP. 
 It should be noted that VIP refers to an encoding strategy for a participant, and not to a 
participant’s thematic centrality, though the two are interrelated.  The opposite extreme of encoding 
can also be used for indicating the discourse prominence of participants.  Minor participants are often 
encoded using lexical NPs, even for continuing reference where a pronominal form would have been 
unambiguous.  Such encoding runs counter to default expectations that continuing reference tends to 
be downgraded to the minimal anaphoric form, but serves the pragmatic purpose of communicating 
the saliency of the participant to the discourse. 
Salience of Discourse Context 
 Let us return again to Givón’s Iconicity principle:  “The more disruptive, surprising, 
discontinuous or hard to process a topic is, the more coding material must be assigned to it” 
(1983a:18, italics mine).  Levinsohn (2000a:136) notes that Givón’s principle fails to account for 
another use of overencoding besides processing, stating that “a sentence may be highlighted and a full 
noun phrase employed when the information concerned is important but neither disruptive nor 
surprising (e.g., a key speech)”.  Levinsohn’s observation is consistent with Longacre’s description of 
‘peak-marking devices’ used for pragmatic highlighting. 
 Longacre (1985) claims that the plot of most narratives builds toward two key elements: a 
climax and a denouement.  “The first corresponds to the point of maximum tension and confrontation 
in a story; the second corresponds to a decisive event that makes resolution of the plot possible.  
Either or both of these may be marked for peak in the surface structure of a narrative discourse” 
(1985:84).  The general cross-linguistic principle Longacre establishes for peak-marking devices is a 
marked shift away from the default, whether it be shifts in tense/aspect, shifts in the pace of narration 
by shortening or lengthening of clauses, shifts in the ratio of verbs to non-verbs for the pragmatic 
effect of ‘speeding up’ the flow, or increases in the amount of repeated or redundant material, etc. 
(ibid:96-97).32   
                                                     
32 Heimerdinger (1999:56) gleans changes in “characteristic PRs” (i.e. participant references) as another peak-
marking convention from his studies of Longacre (1983) and (1990).  
 44
 It will be demonstrated that the overencoding33 of participants in certain contexts is 
pragmatically motivated to obtain effects such as (but not limited to) Longacre’s peak-marking 
devices, to highlight shifts in initiator, or to highlight a following speech or event. Most overencoding 
is not for the purpose of highlighting the participant; such highlighting is prototypically accomplished 
using the tools of information structure (e.g. PoDs and PFCs).  Following Levinsohn (2000a), Clark 
(2000), and Callow (1974), we will argue that pragmatic overencoding using default constituent order 
is primarily cataphoric in nature.  The goal is to highlight a speech or event that follows, not to 
highlight the participant; participant reference is simply the means of marking the feature of 
cataphoric highlighting. 
2.4.2 Study of the Semantic Function  
 The most recognized function of participant reference is the semantic function, which enables 
a reader to track participants across clause boundaries (cf. Foley and Van Valin 1984), to understand 
‘who is doing what to whom’.  Comrie illustrates how well participant reference systems are able to 
track referents, stating “Thus, in a story about Beryl and Charles, and with no other human referents, 
it would be possible, after the initial mention of Beryl and Charles, to use only forms of the pronouns 
he and she with unequivocal reference, even if the story were to grow to novel length” (1989:48).  
The semantic function was the center of attention in Givón’s (1983) edited volume on Topic 
Continuity in Discourse.  The studies Givón commissioned34 clearly demonstrate that discourse 
anaphora is intimately tied to the semantics of participant tracking.  He fundamentally establishes the 
prototypical expectations for referential encoding in a variety of discourse contexts.  
 Givón’s cross-linguistic study attempted to establish an empirical relation between ‘recency 
of reference’ to a participant and the morphological level of encoding for the participant.  The study 
was based on the premise that thematic paragraphs usually have a single participant that is “most 
crucially involved in the action sequence running through the paragraph; it is the participant most 
closely associated with the higher-level ‘theme’ of the paragraph; and finally, it is the participant 
most likely to be coded as the primary topic –or grammatical subject –of the vast majority of 
sequentially ordered clauses/sentences comprising the thematic paragraph” (Givón 1983a:8).  The 
objective of the study was to determine how the following factors impacted “the degree of difficulty 
that speakers/hearers may experience in identifying a topic in discourse” (ibid:11). 
(14) Factors Affecting Topic Availability (Givón 1983a:10-12) 
(a) Length of absence from the register:  Measures the number of clauses a participant remains 
unmentioned.  Brand-new, indefinite NPs were predicted to be the MOST difficult to process, 
while a definite topic from the register which returns after a long gap will be less difficult.  
                                                     
33 We will maintain an important distinction between overencoding a participant by using a lexical NP where a 
pronominal form would suffice, and overspecification, whereby semantically redundant anchoring or other 
descriptive information is assigned to a participant that is semi-active or active. 
34 The languages studied included Japanese, Amharic, Ute, Biblical Hebrew, Colloquial Spanish, written 
English, colloquial English, Hausa and Chamorro.

The shorter the gap, the greater the ease in processing.  
 
(b) Potential interference from other topics:  Ease of topic identification was hypothesized to be 
inversely proportional to the number of topics in the current [semi-active] register.  The fewer 
the topics, the easier the topic identification is expected to be.  
 
(c) Availability of semantic information:  Redundant semantic information (i.e. overspecification) 
may help the hearer identify a particular topic from a cluttered register.  “This information 
comes primarily from the predicate of the clause, less so from verb-phrase adverbials (in 
particularly of manner), less so from other topics/participants of the clause.  This information 
concerns generic probabilities that a particular topic could participate in the clause in the 
specific semantic/grammatical role in question (i.e. as subject, agent, patient, recipient etc.)” 
(ibid:11). 
 
(d) Availability of thematic information:  Similar to (c), but based on the content of the preceding 
discourse.  This could be ranking of participants (e.g. major/minor), or other thematic 
information in the permanent file relating to the particular discourse.  “Such information 
establishes specific probabilities—for this story, in this chapter, in this section or in this 
thematic paragraph—as to the topic identification within a particular clause and in a particular 
role” (ibid:11). 
 Givón’s study also sought to gain insight into the assumptions a speaker makes regarding the 
availability of a particular topic to a hearer.  Givón made several assumptions based on Gestalt 
psychology: 
• “What is more continuing is more predictable” 
• “What is predictable is easier to process” or,  
• “What is discontinuous or disruptive is less predictable” 
• “What is less predictable, hence surprising, is harder to process” (ibid:12) 
These assumptions, together with the factors affecting topic availability, were rolled into three 
measurement devices which were empirically traced in naturally occurring texts from various 
languages.  The measures were “referential distance” (‘look-back’), “potential interference” 
(‘ambiguity’), and “persistence” (‘decay’) (ibid:13-14).  Each of these measures was tallied based on 
clause counts, which were then formulated into ratios for each morphological level of encoding.  It is 
important to note that Givón viewed this study as preliminary, with the conclusions forming the 
starting point for future studies.  He envisioned these studies “correlating the grammatical and 
discourse-distribution data with psycho-linguistic experimentation and measurement” (ibid:13, italics 
his). 
 Givón gleaned a number of typological observations from the present and preceding studies 
he conducted on topic continuity.  Several of the scales he developed from the study have proven 
significant: 
(15) Scales in the Coding of Topic Accessibility 
(a) Scale of topic accessibility (1983a:17) 
most continuous/accessible topic 
zero anaphora 
unstressed/bound pronouns  
stressed/independent pronouns 
R-dislocated DEF-NP’s 
 46
neutral-ordered DEF-NP’s 
L-dislocated DEF-NP’s 
Y-moved NP’s 
cleft/focus constructions 
referential indefinite NP’s 
most discontinuous/inaccessible topic   
 
(b) Scale of phonological size (ibid:18) 
most continuous/accessible topic 
zero anaphora 
unstressed/bound pronouns (‘agreement’) 
stressed/independent pronouns 
 full NP’s 
most discontinuous/inaccessible topic 
 
(c) The Iconicity Principle (ibid:18):“The more disruptive, surprising, discontinuous or hard to 
process a topic is, the more coding material must be assigned to it.” 
The results of his study provided an empirically-based, typological description of prototypical 
principles governing participant reference.  While Givón’s studies provided a description of default 
encoding principles, his methodology was unable to account for participant reference encoding which 
did not follow default principles. 
 While Givón’s study made a significant contribution, it indeed proved to be only the first 
step.  Though his empirical data35 was able to show tendencies and patterns, his framework was 
unable to account for what appeared to be the regular overencoding and underencoding of 
participants, encoding which differed from the expected outcomes.  For instance, Givón claimed that 
topic repetition could function as a discourse marker of discontinuity as a means of explaining 
overencoded NP anaphors; however, this explanation was not developed in any detail (ibid:349).  
Also, he noted that pronominal reference can be maintained across several clauses.  Even though his 
principles argued against such usage (ibid:350), he did not provide an explanation of the discourse 
function of such usage. 
 Clark’s application of Givón’s method to Sio found that its basic assumptions regarding 
referential distance were upheld, once certain morphosyntactic restrictions of the language were taken 
into account (2000:72).  However, neither ‘potential interference’ nor ‘persistence’ had much 
applicability in Sio.  Clark found that “there was no significant relationship between potential 
interference and which of the three lower levels of encoding the speaker used” (ibid:72).  Regarding 
persistence, it was only after a differentiation was made between animate and inanimate participants 
that any generalizations were able to be made.  He cites a portion of text which exemplifies the 
problem, repeated below: 
                                                     
35 Clark notes a methodological inconsistency in Givón’s method:  “Complement clauses, as well as clauses that 
represented direct speech quotations, were not considered to be ‘gaps’ when the referent did not appear in the 
clause, but they were counted as occurrences when the referent did appear in the clause” (2000:7, emphasis his).

355  They struck the abdomen, 
356  but it didn’t resonate. 
357  They struck the head, 
358  but it didn’t resonate. 
359  They struck the back, 
360  but it didn’t resonate (ibid:37). 
According to Givón’s framework, the persistence of the two boys (referred to as they) is theoretically 
zero and therefore necessitates relexicalization, since they are not referred to in lines 356 and 358.  
However, Clark notes that these participants clearly remain cognitively active due to the reduced 
pronominal reference to them.  Givón’s explanations are unable to account for Clark’s attested data. 
 Clark’s study also exposed the limitations of Givón’s approach in accounting for what turned 
out to be a pragmatic system for encoding relative salience of participants, salience of certain events 
or speeches, and the internal thematic structure of the discourse itself (ibid:72-73).  Clark finds that 
there is a meaningful difference in how animate participants are encoded and their persistence 
compared to that of inanimate participants.  “Inanimate subjects tend to decay almost immediately, 
while animate subjects last for an average of five to nine clauses” (ibid:37).  Clark goes on to state 
that combining these two types of participants, as Givón’s method advocates, “totally masks this 
dramatic distinction” (ibid:38).  The Topic Continuity study provided a foundational understanding of 
semantic issues and tendencies of participant reference, but it became quite obvious that much more 
was involved in participant reference than simply semantic disambiguation.  Givón’s default encoding 
principles were only able to account for a portion of the attested data, suggesting that other 
explanations were needed to account for departures from these norms. 
2.4.3 Study of the Processing Function  
 Barbara Fox conducted two studies in which she sought to address the shortcomings she 
found in Givón’s methodology.  “While it must be acknowledged that much of the emphasis on 
distance and ambiguity in the continuity hypothesis arises out of a desire to provide quantitative 
evidence (and hierarchical text structure is hard to quantify), the overemphasis it produces on the 
linear nature of texts (and the encouragement it brings to such a view) needs to be recognized…it may 
be wiser to proceed cautiously with a qualitative approach that incorporates a hierarchical structural 
view of texts to see if we can understand the basic mechanism of anaphora before we begin collecting 
rough quantitative evidence” (1987a:159, italics hers).   
 Fox had good reason for appealing to discourse structure as a means of explaining 
overencoding of anaphors.  In 1980, Chafe coordinated a series of studies in The Pear Stories, which 
sought to describe the cognitive factors influencing referential choice in languages such as English 
and Japanese.  One study in particular by Clancy (1980) suggested that structural factors significantly 
influenced participant encoding.  “The main discourse structures Clancy finds influencing referential 
choice are episode boundaries, wherein a new line of action starts, and world shifts, in which the 
speaker moves from one mode of talking to another (e.g., from digression to the plot line, from film-
 48
viewer mode to story-teller mode).  Both of these structure-types tend to be associated with use of full 
noun phrases” (Fox 1987a:159).   
 The first study Fox completed was a dissertation, Discourse Structure and Anaphora:  
Written and conversational English (1987b).  The second was a study of anaphora in popular English 
narratives which reviewed and extended the conclusions of her dissertation, published as part of 
Tomlin’s study of Coherence and Grounding in Discourse (Tomlin 1987).  Fox (1987a) will be the 
primary focus of this section. 
 Fox sought to “provide a broader and more satisfactory account of anaphoric patterning in 
written narratives than has previously been presented” (1987a:157), and she believed that describing 
the interplay between discourse structure and levels of encoding was the key.  She found that in 
contexts with two participants of the same gender, “it seems that a referent is pronominalizable until 
another character’s goals or actions are introduced, unless those goals and actions are interactive with 
the first character’s…  In other words, if another character begins planning and performing an action, 
and there is no immediate projected interaction between the two characters, then a subsequent 
mention of the first character will be done with a full NP” (ibid:162).  This conclusion has several 
implications: 
(1) Long gaps can pass after which a participant can still be referred to without a NP as long as 
no other participant’s goals or objectives have been mentioned.  This suggests the principle 
that participant reference encoding tends to ‘skip over’ shorter background comments off the 
narrative line “even if the off-line gap introduces a character of the same gender as the 
character in question” (ibid:164).  
 
(2) “Even if the material separating the references is not off-line, as long as it does not introduce 
the current actions of another character, a pronoun can be used to refer to the first character” 
(ibid:164).  This suggests the principle that shift of initiator in the discourse calls for the use 
of a lexical NP.  
 
(3) The introduction of a second character interacting with the first does not automatically 
require use of a NP, such as in a fight, a chase, or in a conversation (ibid:165).  This finding 
nuances finding (2) above about switch in initiator.  Quite often the semantics of the verbs 
will indicate switch of roles so that encoding the switch via participant reference is 
unnecessary.  Such conclusions about reported speech encoding were observed by Pike and 
Lowe (1969), and confirmed in Maibaum (1978:206).  However, if the second participant is 
not interacting with the first, Fox notes that “pronominalization seems to be blocked” 
(1987a:165).  This final observation is a natural extension of her observations about initiators.  
Two participants that are not interacting could be construed as two initiators. 
 
 Research conducted within cognitive psychology has provided quantitative support for 
redundant NPs being processed as a sign of discontinuity.  In the study conducted by Andersen et al. 
(1983), the researchers found that observable patterns of reference exist, and these patterns correlate 
to episode boundaries.  They note that main characters will be available across episodes, while 
episode-specific participants—such as those which are accessible via the schema of an episode—are 
largely bounded by the episode in which they appear.  Thus, if an episode involves a change in 
cognitive scenarios, participants from the previous scenario will require a lexical NP for reactivation 
 49
(ibid:428-430).  In their experiment, Andersen et al. noted that participants required more time to 
identify antecedents following a spatial or temporal shift, than when there was not a shift.  “Both 
continuation and question-answering methods showed that if a time change is beyond the temporal 
scope of a scenario, then representations of scenario-dependent entities are less readily available than 
if the change is within the temporal scope.  The availability of main characters is not so affected” 
(ibid:438).   
 Another quantitative study further confirms the cognitive perception of NPs signaling 
discontinuity.  In a series of experiments, Vonk et al. (1992) asked subjects to do several different 
tasks which compared the presence of thematic shifts with subjects’ use of anaphoric encoding.  The 
general principle they found was that thematic shifts were associated with “overspecified anaphoric 
expressions”, while thematic continuity was associated with pronominal encoding (ibid:315).  
Furthermore, when a thematic discontinuity was signaled using devices such as preposed temporal or 
spatial expressions (i.e. Levinsohn’s PoDs), subjects felt comfortable encoding referents using 
pronouns.  However, where temporal or spatial markers were not used, there was a preference to use 
overencoded anaphoric expressions, i.e., NPs (ibid:329).  In other words, overencoded expressions 
were preferred in the absence of other macro-syntactic discourse markers. 
 Gordon et al. conducted a similar experiment, comparing the reading time of continuing 
reference to a participant using pronouns versus NPs (1993:319).  The researchers found that subjects 
took 11% longer to read the text encoded with NPs compared to those reading the same text encoded 
with pronouns.  Such evidence draws a quantitative link between the processing of overencoded 
anaphors and perceptions of discontinuity.36   
 We will make a few specific comments about Fox’s contribution now, but will reserve the 
larger discussion of the episode/processing method for the conclusion of §2.4.3.  Fox has indeed been 
able to account for many of Givón’s counter-tokens, particularly overencoding, for which Givón was 
only able to offer suggestions.  At the same time, there are overencoding data for which Fox also is 
merely able to offer suggestions.  In particular, she notes overencoding in “fast-paced confrontation 
(fight/chase) where we could have expected pronouns” might be due to a generic structural scheme 
for such situations (1987a:167).   
 These contexts she describes sound very similar to what Longacre describes as a ‘peak’, 
which is prototypically marked by departures from the expected norms in order to attract the reader’s 
attention (cf. Longacre 1983, 1985).  She notes that in certain situations, the pattern of two 
participants interacting (i.e. implication 3) “seems to be superseded (1987a:169).  She believes that 
NPs are used to demarcate new development units (DUs), but not all DUs begin with NPs, nor do all 
                                                     
36 Cf. to the studies of Hudson-D’Zmura (1988), Sanford and Garrod (1981), and Garrod and Sanford (1988), 
which all reach similar conclusions, discussed in Gordon, Grosz and Gilliom (1993). 
 50
redundant NPs signal a new development.  Thus, Fox has provided a reasonable account for many of 
Givón’s (1983) remaining counterexamples, yet she has left some of her own behind as well. 
 Tomlin (1987) conducted several experiments to study the cognitive processing of the ‘’on-
line discourse production’, related to the same phenomenon studied by Fox (1987a).  Based on the 
evidence of two experiments, Tomlin argues that “the syntax of reference is directly a function of 
episodic or thematic boundaries at a relatively local level.  The episodic boundaries in turn can be 
seen as a speaker-based re-orientation of attention during the on-line process of discourse production” 
(1987:455).  Tomlin believes that “during the on-line process of discourse production, the speaker 
uses a pronoun to maintain reference as long as [the speaker’s] attention is sustained on that referent.  
Whenever focus is disrupted, the speaker reinstated reference with a full noun, no matter how few 
clauses intervene between subsequent references” (ibid:458).  Tomlin views the episodes as being 
defined in the speaker’s consciousness, and that as speakers cognitively move across these 
boundaries, the activated referents drop in their activation state, which he refers to as ‘attention’ 
(ibid:457-58).  He seems to view the overencoding less as a signal to the reader37 than as a response 
by the speaker to the discontinuity in his or her online production of the discourse, based on the 
model he describes (ibid:459). 
 In Tomlin’s primary experiment, he showed three groups of subjects a series of 21 slides.  
The first group saw the slides individually; the second group saw a single slide first, and the 
remaining ones in pairs; the third group saw the slides in pairs, except the last.  He found that even 
though the subjects were shown different slides in different groupings, all three groups had roughly 
the same length episodes.  The group that saw the slides singly produced nearly twice as many 
episodes and almost twice as much narrative as the other two groups.  Thus, there was uniformity in 
the preferred length of the episodes.  Also, the number of episodes in the narrative was proportional to 
the number of slide groupings seen.   
 Tomlin’s study added empirical evidence for construing many instances of overencoding as 
accomplishing a processing function.  He found that the episode boundaries accounted for 84% of the 
anaphors in the discourse production, meaning pronouns used within episodes, and overspecified NPs 
occurring at his engineered episode boundaries.  The 16% of counter-tokens consisted of inter-
episode pronominals and intra-episode nominals (ibid:469).  He found that NPs used to mark the 
transitions between non-narrative evaluative comments and resumption of the narrative accounted for 
approximately 90% of the counterexamples.  Such nominal marking was predicted by Prince’s (1980) 
discussion of ‘world shifts’ which Tomlin interprets to be another case of ‘attention shifting’ 
(1987:469).  This phenomenon has also been recognized and described as a ‘point of view shift’ by 
both van Vliet (2002) in Dutch and van Hoek (1997) in English.  Other counterexamples he attributes 
                                                     
37 I.e. Paivio and Begg’s (1981) claim regarding segmentation of discourse into ‘chunks’ by speakers. 
 51
to ambiguity resolution or subjects not following the guidelines of the process, but still a total of 6% 
of the tokens lack explanation.   
 Tomlin closes by stating that “the primary drawback to the episode/paragraph approach lies 
in the difficulty of providing explicit and structure-independent means of identifying episodes and 
episode boundaries” (1987:475).  Claiming that episode identification is difficult is a huge 
understatement. 
 As Clark applied Tomlin’s method to Sio, he regarded his own results as inherently suspect 
based upon the near impossibility of objectively and accurately identifying episode boundaries 
without reference to linguistic marking.  “Even when linguistic evidence such as intonation and other 
formal devices is included in determining episode boundaries, the actual existence of the boundaries 
is not proven and can at best only be inferred” (Clark 2000:73).  He notes that only 25% of the 
overencoded subjects could be accounted for as marking episode boundaries.  This leaves three 
options: that Clark has misidentified the boundaries, that Tomlin’s ‘episode/paragraph’ model is 
unable to account for natural language usage of overencoding, or some combination of the two. 
 Clark concludes, “By focusing so exclusively on the thematic structure of the text, as 
important as this is, Tomlin’s method, like Givón’s, presents only a partial explanation of the over- 
and under-coding of participants in a text.  He makes no attempt to identify the relative importance of 
participants in the text, and he treats direct speech segments in the same cursory way that Givón does.  
Thus, while his method correctly expands the study of participant reference to include discourse-level 
features, a full accounting of why certain expressions are used at certain places is still missing” 
(ibid:74).   
 These studies inform us of the factors influencing encoding, but they are of limited value in 
the formation of descriptive principles which account for the multitude of discourse features which 
influence participant reference.  It has been demonstrated that none of these approaches can 
accurately predict encoding, as counterexamples for each approach abound.  Nor can they be said to 
describe usage, since there is no framework to incorporate the counterexamples.  Thus we believe it is 
more reasonable to view the studies of Givón, Fox and Tomlin more as predictors of factors affecting 
referential encoding than as methods for describing participant reference encoding.   
 The application of these approaches to Sio was significant, especially the resulting 
understanding of Fox/Tomlin.  Fox mentions and dismisses methodologies developed by Grimes 
(1978) and Levinsohn (1978) due to their lack of applicability to English.  However, both of these 
studies, even representing early stages of understanding regarding participant reference, provided a 
better framework for the description of natural language data from diverse languages.  They also 
provided more heuristic results than either the group of studies by Givón (1983) or Tomlin (1987) 
could claim to provide.  Maibaum (1978), Perrin (1978) and Toba (1978), while not quantitative, 
 52
provided a more comprehensive description of both default encoding as well as the pragmatic 
function of departures from the default (i.e., both overencoding and underencoding).38
2.4.4 Study of the Discourse-Pragmatic Function 
 The collections of studies by Hinds (1978) on anaphora, by Grimes (1978) on discourse, and 
the study by Levinsohn (1978) on participant reference clearly demonstrated that something more 
than the semantic and processing purposes are involved in referential encoding.  Though these studies 
did not utilize highly sophisticated methodologies, each description was based on a sound descriptive 
framework.  The framework included establishing the default encoding constraints for new 
participants, as well as for continuing reference to them.  Each study also addresses the relationship 
between referential encoding and the basic structure of narratives in each language.  Finally, each 
study sought to describe the non-default functions of participant reference encoding.  They 
demonstrated that over- or under-encoding of participants created various pragmatic implicatures, 
depending upon the language and context.   
 The initial methodology utilized by Levinsohn was developed over the years through 
application in linguistic workshops, and is most fully expounded in the final chapters of Dooley and 
Levinsohn (2001:109ff).  The framework for description involves selecting a representative corpus of 
narrative for a language, and comparing the referential encoding in various contexts by discretely 
defining contexts which are typically found in narrative, for both subjects and non-subjects: 
(16) Levinsohn’s ‘Default/Marked’ subject and non-subject contexts 
  Subject Contexts 
• INTRO  very first mention of referent 
• S1  subject referent was the subject of the immediately preceding clause;  
• S2  referent was the addressee of a speech reported in preceding clause; 
• S3  referent was in non-subject role other than addressee in preceding clause; 
• S4  contexts other than those covered by S1-S3. 
 
  Non-subject Contexts 
• INTRO  very first mention of referent 
• N1  referent was in the same non-subject role in the preceding clause; 
• N2  referent was the speaker in a speech reported in the preceding clause; 
• N3  referent was in a role in the preceding clause other than N1-N2; 
• N4  contexts other than those covered by N1-N3.  (Dooley and Levinsohn 2001:130-31) 
 
The analyst then proposes default encodings for each context based on a preliminary study, keeping 
the provisos in mind mentioned in §2.1.1.   
 Next, tokens which deviate from the proposed default encoding for each context are 
examined to determine the rationale for using more or less encoding.  It is at this point that the 
                                                     
38 It is evident that much more work remains to be done to fully understand participant reference in minority 
languages.  Cf. Watkins  who concludes his study of participant reference in Kiowa stating, “What remains to 
be discovered, among other things, are the principles underlying the more usual distribution of overt pronouns, 
occurring every four to eight clauses or so” (1990:425).  These pronouns are redundant, and might very well be 
serving a processing function. 
 53
context definitions and proposed defaults are reevaluated and adapted to describe the idiosyncrasies 
of the language’s morpho-syntax.  The functions of the remaining deviant tokens are then described.  
Levinsohn suggests taking into account such things as:  textual discontinuities,39 pragmatic 
structuring of information,40 the relative salience of the participant or following event/speech,41 the 
absence of other participants on stage,42 or the fact that material is being repeated,43 any of which 
might motivate departures from the default. 
 As noted in §2.1.1, the default/marked approach has an established track record as a flexible 
framework for developing a straightforward and thorough description of participant reference 
systems.  In Clark’s (2000) comparison of the three methodologies above, he found the 
default/marked method to be the most comprehensive and heuristic approach.  The key component of 
its efficacy was differentiating default encoding from marked encoding.  He used the default encoding 
constraints as the canon against which to describe the pragmatic effects achieved by marked 
encodings in various contexts.  Clark summarized his experience as follows:  “Default levels for each 
of the contexts were quickly identified, and once deviant tokens were isolated, the explanations for 
marked encoding closely paralleled those presented by Levinsohn.  Practically every over-coded 
token was shown to exist at a point of discontinuity and/or to highlight the action, and under-coding 
was found to be totally explained by repetition or participant prominence.  Thus not only was Givón’s 
Iconicity Principle supported, but specific motivations were identified for every apparent violation of 
the principle” (ibid:75).   
 Clark went so far as to select another narrative to analyze based on the conclusions of his 
initial study.  From a statistical standpoint, the default encoding for context S2 in the second study 
appeared to be NP, while in the first study a subject-agreement affix had been postulated and 
affirmed.  Upon comparing the two narratives, he noted that the second contained much longer 
reported speeches.  Rather than changing his default, Clark was able to account for the NP as marked 
encoding, only used “when the preceding quote is lengthy, or to show discontinuities or highlighting” 
(ibid:76).  The morpho-syntax of Sio also required several changes and additions to the context 
descriptions.  Clark found the framework flexible enough to incorporate such changes.  The changes 
did not prove to be unwieldy for him from a practical standpoint. 
 We now have established a typological understanding of the general functions participant 
reference systems play in language:  semantic, processing, and pragmatic.  We have also identified a 
methodological framework based on establishing a default canon against which marked forms can be 
compared and described.  Before moving on to a review of participant reference studies on Biblical 
Hebrew narrative, one more issue must be discussed:  pragmatic implicatures.   
                                                     
39 Cf. Givón’s action continuity scale (1983a:8, 36), Hopper and Thompson (1984). 
40 Cf. Lambrecht (1994). 
41 Cf. Levinsohn (2000a). 
42 Cf. Givón (1983a:11). 
43 Cf. Dooley and Levinsohn (2001:133). 
 54
 Up to this point, we have only informally discussed pragmatics and pragmatic effects.  A 
more careful explanation is needed to protect against developing ad hoc explanations of pragmatic 
encoding which are not grounded in a typological understanding of the pragmatics of discourse 
anaphora and its resolution by readers. 
2.5 Pragmatic Implicatures of Discourse Anaphora 
 The discourse-pragmatic function of participant reference has recently been theoretically 
affirmed and extended in Huang’s (2000) cross-linguistic study of discourse anaphora.  Huang has 
revised Grice’s (1981) principles of conversational implicature, building on the work of Stephen C. 
Levinson (1985).  Huang argues that a proper understanding of anaphora necessitates reliance upon 
both syntax and pragmatics.  The latter, he argues, has too long been ignored.  “What pragmatics 
does here is to provide a set of complementary, explanatory principles that constrains the 
interpretation or production of an utterance whose linguistic representation has already been 
antecedently cognized” (Huang 2000:213).  His review of various approaches to anaphora reveals that 
most syntactic and some cognitive explanations of discourse-anaphora resolution fail to provide an 
adequate account of the data.  Huang’s revised, neo-Gricean account of discourse anaphora will be 
used as the theoretical framework for explaining discourse-anaphora resolution in Biblical Hebrew 
narrative.   
 There is significant overlap between Grice’s ‘conversational implicatures’ and Sperber and 
Wilson’s Relevance Theory (2002).  While Sperber and Wilson in general agree with Gricean 
pragmatic principles, they claim “the principles governing this apparatus have their source in the 
human central cognitive mechanism.  Consequently, they propose that the entire Gricean programme 
be subsumed within a single cognitive principle, namely, the principle of optimal Relevance… In 
other words, on Sperber and Wilson’s view, in interpreting an utterance, one is always maximizing its 
‘contextual effects’ and minimizing its ‘processing efforts’ to interpret the utterance as optimally 
relevant, that is, to interpret it in a way which is most consistent with the principle of Relevance” 
(Huang 2000:248).  We will maintain the terminology of the Gricean scheme for precision’ sake, 
granting that one is largely able to draw the same conclusions by appealing to Relevance Theory. 
 We will begin the review of Huang by presenting Levinson’s revised Gricean principles.  
Next we present the principles Huang establishes for pragmatic anaphora resolution.  His primary 
interest is to provide a pragmatic framework which coherently describes coreference and clause-level 
anaphora.  In the final section, his conclusions will be adapted and applied to form a model explaining 
the cognitive process whereby marked, referential encoding is processed.  Our final framework is an 
eclectic combination of the neo-Gricean pragmatic implicatures, Relevance Theory principles, and 
Lambrecht’s description of mental representation.

2.5.1 The Quality Principle 
 Grice developed a series of ‘conversational implicatures’ in order to describe the pragmatic 
principles which speakers and hearers ostensibly follow in making their decisions about how 
utterances should both be formed and interpreted.  “Grice suggests that conversational implicatures—
roughly, a set of non-logical inferences that contains conveyed messages which are meant without 
being said in the strict sense—can arise from either strictly and directly observing or deliberately and 
ostentatiously flouting the maxims” (Huang 2000:206).   
 Levinson (1987) has condensed Grice’s nine implicatures into three principles which more 
fully differentiate the implicatures drawn by speakers as opposed to hearers.  This same process has 
also been described using Relevance Theory.  Relevance Theory states that hearers have the 
expectation that utterances are intended by the speaker to be relevant to the context.  If the relevance 
is not immediately clear, the hearer begins a cognitive process whereby a relevant connection can be 
established based on the discourse context, cognitive schemata, world knowledge, etc.  Levinson’s 
(1987) pragmatics model explains the same process, beginning with the Q[uality] principle, given in 
(17). 
(17) Q-principle 
Speaker’s maxim:  Do not provide a statement that is informationally weaker than your 
knowledge of the world allows, unless providing a stronger statement would contravene the I-
principle. 
Recipient’s corollary:  Take it that the speaker made the strongest statement consistent with 
what he knows (Huang 2000:207). 
 
The Q-principle describes the propensity of hearers to infer that no stronger statement is intended than 
what is said.  For instance, consider the following example: 
(18) Question:  Do you like broccoli?  
 Answer:  Well, I don’t hate it. 
 
In the question/answer pair of (18), the questioner has asked a yes/no question, which the responder 
has largely side-stepped with his reply.  The Q-principle guides the questioner to infer that the 
responder indeed does not like broccoli, but is unwilling to bluntly admit it.  The questioner infers 
that the response represents the strongest statement possible under the circumstances.  Huang states, 
“The basic idea is that the use of an expression (especially a semantically weaker one) in a set of 
contrastive semantic alternatives Q-implicates the negation of the interpretation associated with the 
use of another expression (especially a semantically stronger one) in the same set” (ibid:208).  The Q-
principle forms the upper boundary of implicature, viz. if a speaker says X, he is not able to make a 
statement semantically stronger than X based on his knowledge.     
2.5.2 The Informative Principle 
 The implicatures fostered by application of the Q-principle are counter-balanced by those 
drawn by the lower boundary, the I[nformative]-principle, stated in (19). 
 56
(19) I-principle 
Speaker’s maxim:  the maxim of minimization  
’Say as little as necessary’, i.e. produce the minimal linguistic information sufficient to 
achieve your communicational ends (bearing the Q-principle in mind). 
Recipient’s corollary:  the rule of enrichment  
Amplify the informational content of the speaker’s utterance, by finding the most specific 
interpretation, up to what you judge to be the speaker’s M-intended point (ibid:207) 
 
Huang explains that “the conversational implicature engendered by the I-principle is one that accords 
best with the most stereotypical and explanatory expectation given our knowledge about the world” 
(ibid:208).  He gives the following examples to illustrate: 
(20) ‘John turned the key and the music box opened’ I-implicates at least the following: 
(a) John turned the key and then the music box opened. 
(b) John turned the key and thereby caused the music box to open. 
(c) John turned the key in order to make the music box open.  (ibid:209) 
 
The ‘maxim of minimization’ explains the prototypical tendency to use the lowest level of referential 
encoding possible which still allows the hearer to identify a referent.44  This appears to be a 
typological principle governing participant reference encoding.  The corollary to this minimization 
maxim is highly significant, as (20) demonstrates.  The I-principle describes the reader’s tendency to 
‘enrich’ an utterance in order to maximize its relevance to the context.  Things which limit the 
amount of enrichment a hearer will exercise include contextual information (e.g. discourse context, 
perceived speaker intention, the semantic constraints of the utterance) and world knowledge 
(ibid:237ff).  Based on these factors, the person reading (20) in its discourse context will draw the 
most relevant implicature of (a)-(c). 
2.5.3 The Markedness Principle 
 The expectation created by the M-principle is that if a non-default form is used, it was done 
intentionally and with a purpose.  The M-principle is stated in (21). 
(21) M-principle 
Speaker’s maxim:  Do not use a prolix, obscure or marked expression without reason. 
 
Recipient’s corollary:  If the speaker used a prolix or marked expression M, he or she did not 
mean the same as he or she would have had he or she used the unmarked expression U—
specifically he or she was trying to avoid the stereotypical associations and I-implicatures of 
U  (ibid:207-208).  
 
The primary point of the M-principle is that when a speaker uses a marked form or utterance M, he is 
intending to M-implicate something that using a default or unmarked form or utterance would not 
have implicated.  Put another way, Huang claims “that the use of a marked expression M-implicates 
the negation of the interpretation associated with the use of an alternative, unmarked linguistic 
expression…  Taken together, the I- and M-principles give rise to complementary interpretations:  the 
                                                     
44 Cf. preference for minimal encoding in cases of continuing reference described by Givón (1983a), Chafe 
(1976), and Perrin (1978). 
 57
use of an unmarked linguistic expression tends to convey an unmarked message, whereas the use of a 
marked linguistic expression tends to convey a marked message” (ibid:210).  While this M-principle 
appears to be self-evident, it is nonetheless crucial to explaining the pragmatic effect of using a 
marked form as opposed to a default one.  Let us consider an example. 
(22) Pragmatic Effect of Marked versus Unmarked Referring Expressions:  
Question from husband to wife  
“How was your time shopping with the children?”  
Responses 
(a)  “The children behaved themselves well…”  
 
(a’)  “Your children refused to listen to directions…” 
 
There is a difference in the referring expressions in (a) and (a’).  The former is an acceptable 
expression for referring to one’s children in an unmarked way.  The latter, which simply exchanges 
the definite article for a possessive pronoun, significantly changes the implicatures drawn from the 
referring expression.  Alternatively, one could change the referring expression “the children” in the 
question to “Bob and Sue”, with response (a) using the pronoun “they”, and the marked implicature 
of (a’) would still remain.  The use of the marked referring expression in (a’) was purposefully used 
by the speaker to convey an implicature that the unmarked expression in (a) would not have 
communicated. 
2.5.4 The Neo-Gricean Principles and the Cognitive Processing 
 We have examined the three typological functions of participant reference, and outlined how 
utterances are shaped and cognitively processed in order to build mental representations.  We have 
also described the pragmatic implicatures utilized by speakers and hearers in communication.  We 
would like to draw all of these elements together in order to propose a model for describing the 
cognitive path hearers follow in analyzing overencoded referring expressions.  We are not concerned 
here with the semantic resolution of anaphora, either at the sentence or discourse level.  Rather, 
assuming that the reader understands ‘who does what to whom’, we are interested in answering the 
following questions: what are the implicatures drawn from overencoded expressions, and in what 
order are these implicatures processed? 
 Based on the Q-principle and the I-principle, hearers appear to expect that speakers will use 
referring expressions which meet the semantic needs of the context.  For instance when a new 
participant is introduced, the hearer expects that the speaker will provide both a primary referring 
expression for the new referent and an anchoring relation which grounds it to the discourse context.  
When two participants switch roles from one clause to the next, and the semantics of the verb are 
such that minimal encoding would create ambiguity, the hearer expects the speaker will provide 
sufficient encoding to avoid ambiguity.  We would propose that hearers and readers analyze 
referential encoding as first fulfilling the semantic function of participant reference. 
 58
 If the referential encoding is more than what the context requires (e.g., for reactivation or for 
disambiguation), the hearer then M-implicates that the extra information is intended for some purpose 
other than the unmarked, semantic purpose.  Based on the findings of cognitive psychology discussed 
in §2.4.3, readers seem to resolve the extra encoding as a signal to create a new mental chunk.45  
Redundant NPs in the experimental discourse lead to slower reading times,46 while numerous studies 
have demonstrated that hearers process redundant NPs as signaling slight discontinuities, referred to 
here as development units.47  However, as the studies of both Fox and Tomlin demonstrated, there are 
yet other uses of redundant NPs for which the processing function is unable to give an adequate 
account. 
 Again, based on the M-principle and the findings of Maibaum (1978), Perrin (1978), Toba 
(1978), Levinsohn (1978, 1994, 2000a), and Clark (2000), it is reasonable to infer that redundant 
encoding, which exceeds the amount needed to signal a new development unit, is M-implicated by the 
reader as signaling something other than the processing function.  The typological function that such 
encoding has been associated with is the cataphoric highlighting of a following speech or event.  
More explicit description of this pragmatic function of overencoding necessitates an established 
default baseline.  Therefore we will reserve further discussion of this issue until Chapter 6. 
 These functions of participant reference are not mutually exclusive, but form an entailment 
hierarchy.  Put another way, an overencoded referential expression may accomplish a processing 
function yet it still serves a semantic function as well even though it is redundant.  An overencoded 
referring expression which serves a marked, pragmatic function, we would propose, is at the same 
time serving a processing and semantic function as well.  This entailment hierarchy can be 
summarized as follows: 
(23) Entailment hierarchy for cognitive processing of marked referring expressions 
 
Semantic  Processing  Pragmatic 
 
 In this chapter we have introduced and outlined our methodological framework in preparation 
for developing a well-reasoned description of participant reference for Biblical Hebrew narrative.  We 
also introduced a number of factors which have been shown cross-linguistically to impinge upon the 
encoding decisions of speakers/writers, e.g. information structure constraints, discourse boundaries, 
and cataphoric highlighting of speeches or events.  With our theoretical and methodological 
framework assembled, we will now survey the studies of participant reference conducted in Biblical 
                                                     
45 We do not agree with Tomlin’s model (1987, cf. §2.4.3) that encoding reflects the cognitive conception of the 
speaker.  Rather, we view overencoding as a pragmatic decision on par with the pragmatic structuring of 
propositions described by Lambrecht (1994).  In our view, it appears that speakers make such pragmatic 
decisions quite naturally, without overt deliberation (except on very rare occasions).  Therefore, we will proceed 
analyzing referential encoding as a pragmatic signal from the speaker to the hearer.

6. Marked Encoding of Participants-Thematic and Cataphoric 
Highlighting 
6.1 Introduction: Theoretical Frame of Reference 
 In the previous chapter, one of the pragmatic effects of overencoding an active subject in 
Biblical Hebrew narrative was examined, viz. to mark new developments in the discourse in contexts 
of relative continuity.  The segmentation of the text helps the reader process the discourse.  However, 
based on our description thus far, two other types of overencoding remain unaccounted for.  The first 
type involves the use of marked lexical encoding of participants (i.e. use of a lexical NP where a 
pronominal element would suffice).  The second type involves the marked semantic encoding of 
participants through the pragmatic use of non-default referring expressions.   
 The marked use of referring expressions prototypically involves either the substitution of a 
non-default expression for a participant’s primary referring expression, or the supplementation of the 
primary referring expression with anchoring or other thematically-salient information.  We shall 
maintain a distinction between these two phenomena by referring to lexical overencoding as simply 
‘marked encoding’ or ‘overencoding’, while the semantic manipulation of referring expressions will 
be grouped under the rubric of ‘marked expressions’ or ‘overspecification’ of the participant.  The 
former concerns the distinction between pronominal versus lexical forms while the latter concerns the 
distinction between default versus marked referring expressions.  We will begin our description of 
these remaining overencoded and overspecified tokens of with a discussion of prominence and the 
cognitive processing of prominence markers.   
6.1.1 Pragmatic Resolution of Marked Encoding and Marked Expressions 
 We begin by recalling Huang’s (2000) revised, neo-Gricean pragmatic scheme of anaphora 
resolution.  Grice’s principles were developed to describe unspoken implicatures observed in English 
conversations.  They were later revised by Stephen C. Levinson (1987, 1991, 1995), who 
demonstrated that the revised principles are much more pervasively active in language in general, and 
are not merely principles restricted to English conversation.  Huang revised Levinson’s (1987, 1991, 
1995) neo-Gricean principles into a cross-linguistic, pragmatic account of anaphora resolution, and 
confirmed that these pragmatic principles indeed apply much more universally than previously 
thought.  He further argued that anaphora resolution is processed and resolved using a complementary 
system of pragmatic principles, even though it is syntactically constrained.  Huang demonstrated that 
these principles are able to describe anaphora resolution procedures in incredibly diverse languages 
 145
and systems of reference.175  Based upon Huang’s findings, we will adapt his theoretical framework 
into a pragmatic description of anaphora resolution for the Biblical Hebrew narrative of our corpus. 
The I-principle:   
 The I-principle states, “‘Say as little as necessary’, i.e. produce the minimal linguistic 
information sufficient to achieve your communicational ends (bearing the Q-principle in mind)” 
(Huang 2000:207).  We would rephrase this principle to describe default participant reference 
encoding as ‘utilize the minimal level of encoding necessary to avoid ambiguity’.  
 According to Huang’s ‘general pattern of anaphora’176 and his ‘semantic content 
hierarchy’,177 the reader assumes that the most reduced anaphoric form will be utilized to encode 
active participants.  In the case of clitic pronouns encoding subjects of finite verbs in Biblical 
Hebrew, the reader assumes ‘same subject’ (SS) in narrative, or ‘different subject’ (DS) following 
quotative frames.  Similarly, verbal arguments encoded as clitic pronouns or zero anaphora, are 
processed as coreferent with the corresponding arguments of the preceding clause in context N1, or 
with the previous speaker in context N2.178  Thus in Huang’s model, the I-principle establishes the 
expectation that the most semantically and morphologically simple form will be used to encode active 
participants.  However, if the reader encounters encoding not accounted for by the I-principle, then 
the Q-principle comes into play. 
The Q-principle:   
 The Q-principle states, “Do not provide a statement which is informationally weaker than 
your knowledge of the world allows, unless providing a stronger statement would contravene the I-
principle” (ibid:207).  Rephrasing this principle for resolution of overencoding would render, ‘utilize 
the most referentially-informative expression available in order to avoid ambiguity’.  If the reader 
notices other-than-minimal encoding,179 the Q-principle states that the reader will process this higher 
                                                     
175 “What I have been arguing is that syntax interacts with pragmatics to determine many of the anaphoric 
processes that are thought to be at the very heart of grammar.  If this is the case, then a large portion of linguistic 
explanation concerning anaphora which is currently sought in grammatical terms may need to be shifted to 
pragmatics, hence the interaction and division of labour between syntax and pragmatics.  This interface and 
division of labour between syntax and pragmatics may be summarized in a Kantian slogan:  “pragmatics without 
syntax is empty; syntax without pragmatics is blind” (Huang 1994:259).  What pragmatics does here is to 
provide a set of complementary, explanatory principles that constrains the interpretation or production of an 
utterance whose linguistic representation has already been antecedently cognized” (Huang 2000:213). 
176 Huang’s general pattern of anaphora:  “reduced, semantically general anaphoric expressions tend to favour 
locally coreferential interpretations; full, semantically specific anaphoric expressions tend to favour locally non-
coreferential interpretations” (ibid:214). 
177 Huang’s semantic content hierarchy:  “The inherent semantic content of the lexical NPs tends to be 
semantically more specific than that of a pronoun and the inherent semantic content of a pronoun, than that of a 
zero anaphor,” viz. Lexical NPs > pronouns > zero anaphors” (ibid:215). 
178  Cf. §4.4.1 for provisos regarding role-changes being indicated in the semantics of the verb, etc. 
179 Minimum encoding for subjects of Biblical Hebrew finite verbs is a clitic pronoun, while non-finite verbal or 
verbless clauses require independent personal pronouns for subjects (We find only one instance of zero 
anaphora of the subject/agent, viz. Gen 24:30d, and therefore do not consider this sufficient evidence to overturn 
 146
level of encoding as semantically necessary based on the constraints of the context.  Contexts which 
require more than minimal encoding for active participants include:  marked, syntactic 
constructions,180 or disambiguation.181  
The M-principle:   
 The M-principle states, “Do not use a prolix, obscure or marked expression without reason” 
(ibid:208).  Huang explains that if a speaker uses a marked expression M, a pragmatic choice has been 
made not to use an unmarked expression U, and the I-implicatures associated with it.   
6.1.2 Prominence 
 Scholars have long noted that discourse is more than a linear series of connected events, but 
is instead organized into a hierarchical framework.182  Within this hierarchy, not every event or 
participant is equally salient; certain elements will have more prominence than others.  Longacre 
makes this point by saying, “Discourse without prominence would be like pointing to a piece of black 
cardboard and insisting that it was a picture of black camels crossing black sands at midnight” 
(1985:83).   
 Callow defines prominence as “any device whatever which gives certain events, participants, 
or objects more significance than others in the same context” (1974:50).  We do not conceive of 
prominence as an inherent quality of a constituent.  Rather, prominence judgments are determined by 
evaluating the markedness of the constituent relative to other comparable discourse elements.  We 
would argue that prominence and emphasis have been poorly defined concepts largely due to scholars 
vaguely describing, or inaccurately describing, the baseline default against which the so-called 
emphatic element stands out.  Prominence is inseparably connected to reader-expectations, thus it is 
crucial that scholars precisely identify not just the marked form, but also the normative pattern against 
which the particular form is relatively more prominent.  Relative prominence can be assigned in one 
of two ways, either naturally or pragmatically.   
                                                                                                                                                                     
the claims of Givón (1983a) and Fox (1983) that subject agreement is required in Biblical Hebrew.  Minimum 
encoding for objects is either zero anaphora or clitic pronouns, cf. Chapter 4. 
180 Cf. §4.4.2.  Biblical Hebrew utilizes syntactic constructions which involve constituent movement, e.g. 
referential PoDs (i.e. topicalization), marked focal constituents, and a left- or right-dislocation.  Therefore, the 
creation of such a marked construction necessitates the use of an independent, movable morphological form 
such as an independent personal pronoun, a demonstrative pronoun, or a lexical NP. 
181 More-than-minimum encoding is necessary at times to disambiguate active referents, either due to a switch in 
roles or participants, or due to the semantics of a particular verb (cf. §4.3). For an example of the latter, 
consider:  ‘Bill1 gave it to Bob2 and he1/2 left’.  The subject in the second clause could be construed as either 
referring to Bill, based on pronominal encoding indicating ‘same subject’ in narrative, or possibly as referring to 
Bob based on the expectations associated with the semantics of ‘giving’, viz. a possible role change between 
agent and patient in the following clause.  Though a clause may manifest morphological overencoding, the Q-
principle guides the reader to process it as semantically necessary in the context, and not as pragmatically 
marked. 
182 E.g. Callow (1974), Grimes (1977), Chafe (1981), Givón (1983a), Tomlin (1987), Fox (1987), Talstra 
(1997). 
 147
Natural Prominence 
 Let us consider an example of natural prominence.  Foley and Van Valin (1984:371) have 
noted that the semantics of certain verb types tend to convey more naturally prominent information 
than others, depending on the genre of the discourse.  Verbs of achievement and accomplishment will 
tend to be used in clauses which communicate the mainline events of a narrative, while stative verbs 
tend to be used in clauses which communicate background information.183  Since narrative is event 
driven, the mainline events will have more natural prominence than the background information, 
though the relative prominence of these verb types would be very different in an expository genre, 
which is not event-driven. 
Pragmatically-Marked Prominence 
 In contrast to natural prominence, pragmatic prominence is intentionally assigned by the 
writer or speaker through the use of a marker of some kind.  We shall say that these markers highlight 
the element, assigning it prominence it would not otherwise naturally have received.  A number of 
pragmatic markers have been identified and described in Biblical Hebrew which highlight an element 
as relatively more prominent than other elements in the same context.  Van der Merwe et al. describe 
several Biblical Hebrew adverbs as ‘focus particles’ based on the fact that “they place a particular 
focus on the entity or clause that follows them” (2000:311-317).  The focus particle pragmatically 
assigns prominence to the constituent that it would not otherwise have received, based on the fact that 
they are essentially optional.  These particles include ִּבְלִּתי ,ַּגם ,ֶאֶפס ,ַאף ,ַאְך, and ַרק.  Another example 
of a pragmatic prominence marker is what Van der Merwe et al. describe as a ‘discourse marker’ such 
as ֵהן and ִהֵּנה (ibid:328-333).  A discourse marker “often draws attention to the contents of the 
succeeding sentence(s), affording that sentence(s) greater prominence within its larger context” 
(ibid:59).  Follingstad states, “Hinneh draws attention to a proposition indicating it is important or 
salient in the given context… [It] indicates the presence of counterexpected, counterdesired, or 
overlooked presuppositions” (1995:22).  The use of such particles in Biblical Hebrew is one of the 
means of pragmatically adding prominence to a clause or phrase that it would not otherwise naturally 
have received apart from the use of the particle. 
 To summarize our discussion thus far, natural prominence refers to the significance one 
discourse constituent has relative to comparable alternatives available in a given context.  Marked 
prominence refers to prominence which is pragmatically assigned to a constituent by the 
speaker/writer via some sort of marker, such as focus particles, discourse markers such as hinneh, or 
marked information structures.  The pragmatic marker assigns prominence to the constituent that it 
would not otherwise naturally have received. 
                                                     
183 This illustration is taken from Levinsohn’s (2000a:172-73) introduction of ‘backgrounding of sentences’ 
using verbal aspect in NT Greek.

6.1.3 Pragmatically-Marked Prominence and Cognitive Processing 
 The terms prominence, highlighting, and emphasis are at times used synonymously, and are 
at times used carelessly.  What exactly does highlighting entail?  How is highlighting cognitively 
processed?  In order to answer these questions we will revisit our original theoretical framework, 
recalling the concepts of markedness, mental representations, and Huang’s revised neo-Gricean 
pragmatic implicatures,184 in order to formulate an explanation.  In doing so, we will utilize available 
empirical research as a means of cognitively accounting for the mental processing of highlighting in 
discourse. 
 Recall from §2.2.1 the claim of Lambrecht (1994:43) that as readers read a text, they are 
building mental representations of the information communicated in the discourse.  One component 
of that building process involves recognizing and tracking patterns.  As discourse is processed, 
readers develop expectations based upon established patterns.  Some of these patterns are inherent in 
the language itself, others are unique to the genre of the specific discourse.  For instance, our Chapter 
4 was dedicated to describing the default patterns of participant reference observed in the narrative of 
Gen 12-25.  Some of these patterns are based on the morphology of Biblical Hebrew, e.g. the need to 
include subject pronouns with non-finite verb forms since these verbs do not grammaticalize subject 
agreement like finite verb forms.  Other patterns are more genre-related, e.g. the difference in how 
minimal encoding of subjects is construed following a quotative frame compared to following a 
clause in narrative proper:  the former is construed as switch of speaker and addressee, the latter is 
construed as continuity of subject.  
 Recognition of such patterns, we argue, creates certain expectations within the reader that the 
writer or the discourse will follow the established pattern.  When a reader discovers something that 
counters this expectation, the unexpected item stands out.  In other words, it is construed as marked 
based on the norm or expectation which has been established.  Thus, marking can occur in a 
grammatical sense:  this was described regarding the overencoding of active participants in Chapter 5.  
These redundant NPs are cognitively processed as marking the presence of some non-default feature 
by virtue of the fact that the reader’s expectation that active participants be minimally encoded is 
countered by the presence of a NP.  A large number of empirical and descriptive studies have claimed 
that such overencoding is processed in various languages as a marker of discontinuity.185  Similarly, 
                                                     
184 For an application of neo-Gricean principles to a diverse body of both Western and non-Western languages, 
cf. Gundel et al. (1993) on the topic of referentiality, and Huang (2000) on the topic of anaphora resolution.  
Such cross-linguistic evidence argues for construing these principles more as describing human language 
processing than describing Western conversational inferences, as some might argue. 
185 Cf. Paivio and Begg (1981) on the cognitive need to break discourse into manageable ‘chunks’ for

deviation from default syntactic norms are what mark points of departure, preposed focal constituents, 
and dislocation constructions, as accomplishing some task other than what the default syntax would 
accomplish. 
 Expectations can also be formulated based upon the specific content of the discourse itself.  
For instance in the genealogy of Gen 5, each individual epitaph ends with the statement, “and he 
died”, thus establishing an expectation that this pattern will be followed.  This is indeed the case until 
v. 24, where we find an additional comment about Enoch in lieu of a death report.   
 We argue that these kinds of departures from established or expected norms described above 
illustrate the very nature of prominence.  Callow defines prominence as “any device whatever which 
gives certain events, participants, or objects more significance than others in the same context” 
(1974:50).  So on the one hand, markedness concerns the means by which a feature is signaled to be 
present or not.  On the other hand, prominence concerns the response to the marked feature.  
Markedness concerns recognition, prominence concerns response.   
 Readers appear to assign meaning to the disruption of patterns, assuming that it is both 
intentional and designed to add significance to the item in question.  Literary scholars have observed 
this phenomenon in describing how breaks in repeated patterns in Biblical Hebrew are processed.186  
From a cognitive standpoint, Sperber and Wilson’s (2002) relevance theory would argue that this 
phenomenon results from the human desire to make sense of one’s environment, and is not simply a 
Western, cultural quirk.  Whatever framework one chooses to describe it, there appears to be a 
pervasive and consistent quest by readers to process and understand.  One aspect of this processing is 
reconciling departures from expected or established norms, whatever they might be.  A common 
response is assigning significance or intentionality to the anomaly (i.e. the M-principle).  We argue 
that this human tendency to assign significance to departures from the expected norms is what 
underpins the concept of linguistic prominence, and we construe this to be a cognitive process.  Thus, 
we understand the phenomenon of linguistic prominence to be directly related to pattern recognition.  
Departures from the perceived norms are assigned significance, based upon the principles of 
relevance theory, poetics, and Gricean pragmatics.   
 One very significant implication of prominence must be noted: prominence will only be 
perceived to the extent that the pattern on which it is based is perceived.  Some view the use of the 
terms ‘prominent’ and ‘emphasized’ in Biblical Studies as being virtually meaningless.  
Unfortunately, this criticism is usually justified.  The apparent root of this problem is that scholars 
have claimed something is emphatic or prominent without clearly and accurately defining the 
underlying pattern which makes it stand out in the first place.  This is certainly the case with the so-
called ‘emphatic personal pronoun’ in Biblical Hebrew.  Scholars were rightly recognizing that the

presence of the personal pronoun seemed to achieve pragmatic effects that minimal reference did not 
achieve.187  However, this description is flawed in several ways.  First, minimal reference is not a 
widely-attested option with non-finite verb forms, and therefore the pattern needs to be limited to 
presence of the IPP with finite verbs.  Second, Lambrecht (1994) has delineated two different 
rationales for using an explicit pronoun in a pro-drop language like Biblical Hebrew: for establishing 
an explicit cognitive frame of reference (e.g. a referential PoD), or for assigning emphatic prominence 
(i.e. focus).  Muraoka and others were indeed recognizing something associated with personal 
pronouns, but due to the fact that they did not adequately describe the underlying pattern, their overall 
account of emphatic pronouns is flawed.188
 In light of the preceding discussion, we would propose that prominence can only be described 
to the extent that the pattern underlying the prominent element is properly delineated and described.  
Therefore, we will draw heavily upon the norms established in the preceding chapters as the primary 
basis for describing the pragmatic effects achieved by marked encoding of participants.   
 Let us now consider the two primary functions of the marked use of participant reference for 
pragmatic highlighting in Biblical Hebrew narrative.  We propose two kinds of pragmatic encoding 
related to prominence, each serving a different function.  The first method utilizes a change to the 
participant’s referring expression (even temporarily) from the established norm.  The second method 
of pragmatic highlighting utilizes overencoding above and beyond what is needed to signal a new 
development. The meaningful distinction between the two methods is the locus of the prominence.  
Table 8 contains our working definitions. 
Table 8. Kinds of Pragmatic Highlighting utilizing Participant Reference 
Thematic highlighting:  Assigns added prominence to information that is crucial to 
understanding the interpretive point of the story.  Thematic highlighting places the spotlight 
on the added information itself. 
 
Cataphoric highlighting:  Cataphorically adds prominence to surprising or important 
developments.  Cataphoric highlighting places the spotlight on a following speech or event, 
not on the added information itself. 
 Callow (1974:50) urges analysts to make a distinction between the device by which 
prominence is signaled, and the domain over which the prominence extends.  In the case of thematic 
highlighting, the encoded information itself is highlighted, and thus the scope is rather limited.  Bar-
Efrat makes the point that only in rare cases do biblical characters receive a detailed physical 
description (1989:48).  When a description is given it is because it is somehow salient for the story 
that follows.  For instance the fact that Esau is hairy (Gen 25:25), that Sarah is beautiful (Gen 12:11), 
that Leah’s eyes were weak and that Rebekah was beautiful (Gen 29:17) is not just provided for color, 
but to set the stage for some later part of the plot where the information is crucial for understanding 
                                                     
187 Cf. Muraoka (1985:47ff), Davidson (1902, §1, §103, §104c), Fox (1983:223), Joüon-Muraoka (1996, §146a)

the point of the story (ibid:48-53, cf. Berlin 1983:34-37).  Thematic highlighting, as we will illustrate 
in §6.2, is one of the means available for (re)iterating this salient information, often at the point it is 
most salient.    
 On the other hand, cataphoric highlighting, as we conceive of it, is something analogous to a 
linguistic ‘speed bump’, slowing the reader down just prior to a salient speech or event.  The majority 
of cataphoric highlighting tokens we have identified in our corpus relate to reported speeches.  The 
use of thematic highlighting in Genesis 12-25 will be described first (§6.2), then attention given to the 
pragmatic effects associated with it (§6.3). 
6.2 Thematic Highlighting 
 Callow introduces participant reference stating, “A common way of referring to a known 
participant is by his role, whether this be his family relationship (‘the father,’ ‘the firstborn’), his 
nationality (’the Hebrew’), his social position (‘the visitor’), his official position (‘the ruler’), or 
whatever is appropriate in the context” (1974:34).  Her final point is key to understanding referring 
expressions—‘whatever is appropriate in the context’.  Prototypically, an active or semi-active 
participant’s discourse role is redundantly reasserted either to indicate a change in the role or to 
update the role when it becomes particularly salient.  We have observed two different means from 
our corpus of thematically highlighting information, listed below: 
a) Switching referring expressions:  substituting an alternate referring expression for a referent’s 
primary referring expression, e.g. referring to Sarah as ה ִאָּׁש֔  the woman’ in Gen 12:14 and‘  ָה֣
15d while Abraham is lying about her relation to him; 
b) Supplementing referring expressions:  adding anchoring or other thematic information to the 
referring expression of an active or semi-active participant, e.g. the addition of anchoring 
expressions to every participant in Gen 16:3:  
ֶׁשת־ַאְבָר֗ח ָׂשַרַ֣וִּתַּק֞ ה׃ּה ֥לם ִאיָׁשּ֖ה ְלַאְבָר֥ן ֹאָתַ֛וִּתֵּת֥... ּה ִׁשְפָחָת֔ר ַהִּמְצִרי֙תם ֶאת־ָהָג֤י ֵאֽ   ֹו ְלִאָּׁשֽ
‘And Sarai, Abram’s wife, took Hagar, her Egyptian handmaid…and gave her to Abram, 
her husband, as a wife’;  
Each of these devices will be considered in turn.  We will begin with a discussion of the empirical 
data available, provide an account of its use in our corpus, and then conclude the section by 
discussing the pragmatic effects that we propose these devices achieve. 
6.2.1 Switching from Primary Referring Expressions 
 Several psycholinguistic experiments were conducted that investigated the use of proper 
names as referring expressions.  The goal was to describe their usage in conversational English.  
Discourse-established referring expressions were found to be more accessible than alternate referring 
expressions, and shown to significantly facilitate anaphora resolution.  Sanford et al (1988:51-54) 
argue that “proper-named characters are more ‘referentially accessible’ than role-described 
 152
characters” such as those referred to using epithets.  Barr and Keysar (2002:391) found that listeners 
more quickly identified referents when established referring expressions were used, than when 
alternative NPs were used.  McDonald and Shaibe (2002:356) reached similar conclusions, claiming 
that proper names are construed as more accessible than simple NPs, confirming the findings of 
Gundel et al. (1993).   
 Regarding reader or listener expectations about the continued use of established referring 
expressions, Barr and Keysar found that “listeners expected speakers to adhere to precedents even in 
contexts where it would lead to referential overspecification” (2002:391).  In other words, sustained 
use of discourse-established referring expressions189 was expected by listeners, and their use resulted 
in faster anaphora resolution.  These findings are consistent with the expectations outlined in the Q- 
and I-principles: to be as specific as possible, and to be as brief as possible.  Such evidence suggests 
that these pragmatic principles have more to do with they way humans process language than with 
one language’s conversational idiosyncrasies. 
 Downing’s (1996) study of listener preferences also reached conclusions consistent with Barr 
and Keysar.  Downing determined that listeners preferred the use of established proper names over 
epithets, noting that underspecifying a participant when a more informative referring expression was 
available was often viewed as unacceptable.190  “In contexts where full lexical recognitionals are 
called for, names often seem to be preferred over the sorts of forms that could be used, such as 
definite common noun phrases” (ibid:109).  Again, these finding are consistent with the neo-Gricean 
principles that speakers use the briefest form and be as informative as possible. 
 These studies demonstrate a clear preference (and perhaps expectation) in English that 
established referring expressions be maintained throughout a discourse.  Based on the consistency of 
these findings with the neo-Gricean principles, and based on the data from our corpus that default 
referring expressions are not often changed, it is reasonable to analyze switches of referring 
expressions in order to determine if there is a pragmatic motivation, especially where the substituted 
expression is less informative than the default.  
 To begin with, consider a compelling example from outside our corpus:  the switching of 
referring expressions for ‘Saul’ in the narrative proper of 1 Samuel.191  Saul’s proper name is used 
                                                     
189 The referring expressions used were not all proper names, but represented mutually agreed-upon reduced 
designations.  For instance, on of the objects in the experiment was a piece of paper folded in the shape of a V 
and placed upside down.  It was referred to by the experimenter as ‘the tent’. 
190 “As Grice pointed out some twenty years ago, the information that my wife is having an affair is likely to be 
much more valuable to me than the information that some woman is having an affair.  In fact, the use of 
recognitionals is so much the norm that a speaker who fails to use one when possible can be charged with a 
violation of Grice’s maxim of quantity (Grice 1975), if not outright deception (Prince 1981)” (Downing 
1996:107-108).  One finds a comparable exploitation of the maxim of quantity (i.e. the Q-principle) in 2 Sam 
12, as Nathan confronts King David.  Nathan refers to David in the parable as ‘the rich man’, disguising the 
actual referent until the parable has been completely told. 
191 This example was presented as part of a paper delivered to the Linguistics and Biblical Hebrew Section at the 
2005 SBL Annual meeting in Philadelphia, PA. 
 153
258x, only once with ‘son of Kish’ as a redundant anchor.192  Interestingly, the expression ‘king’ is 
only substituted for ‘Saul’ fourteen times; it is added as an appositive once.  The one occurrence of 
‘King Saul’ occurs in 1 Sam 18:6, describing the scene of the women coming out to greet King Saul 
and David after the death of Goliath, singing the refrain that begins Saul’s paranoia:  ‘Saul has slain 
his thousands, and David his ten-thousands’. 
 Even more interesting are the places where the writer/editor substitutes the expression ‘king’ 
for ‘Saul’:  four times in the aftermath of David’s victory over Goliath (as Saul becomes increasingly 
paranoid of David),193 twice in 1 Sam 20:24, 25 (where David avoids a feast after Saul twice attempts 
to pin him to the wall with a spear), seven times surrounding Doeg the Edomite’s agreement to slay 
the priests of Nob for aiding David,194 and once in 1 Sam 28:13 to describe the medium’s realization 
that she has been conjuring for the ‘king.’  
 Thus, it is noteworthy that the writer/editor refers to Saul as ‘king/King Saul’ only in 
instances where his actions seem improprietous (cf. Revell 1996:18).  Sternberg notes that “a biblical 
epithet serves at least two functions, one bearing directly on the character it qualifies and the other 
bearing indirectly on the plot where he figures as agent or patient” (1985:337-38).  Sternberg follows 
this statement with an extensive discussion about how information about the participant plays a 
thematic role in the shaping and interpretation of biblical narrative (ibid:338-41).  We would argue 
that the selective usage of various referring expressions gives reason to argue that inclusion and 
exclusion of redundant anchors is intentional and pragmatically motivated.  In the case of selectively 
calling Saul ‘king’, the writer/editor is able to highlight higher-level discourse themes, viz. comparing 
Saul’s worthiness to be king with David’s worthiness. 
 We now present some passages from our corpus that illustrate the pragmatic switching of 
referring expressions.  We begin by discussing the switches observed in the pericope of Abraham and 
Sarah sojourning in Egypt recounted in Gen 12:10-20.  On the way to Egypt, Abraham asks Sarah, his 
wife, to say that she is really his sister.  Sarah ostensibly agrees, but her true relation is eventually 
revealed to Pharaoh by YHWH in v. 17.  Note that while Abraham’s deception is being played out in 
vv. 14-16, Sarah is only referred to pronominally or as ֣הִאָּׁשָ֔ה  ‘the woman’.  Her proper name, or any 
referring expression that relates her to Abraham, is conspicuously avoided.  However, after Pharaoh 
discovers the truth, the same term הִ֔אָּׁש  occurs 4x, but each time as an anchored expression, once to 
Pharaoh and 3x to Abraham.  Again, the proper name ’Sarai’ appears to be avoided except in 12:17 at 
the point where the deception ends; it is not used again until Gen 16:1. 
 Thus, we find that the deception narrative is bracketed at both ends with reference to Sarah as 
Abram’s wife.  We construe the reference י ִאְׁשּ֔תֹו  in vv. 11 and 17 as overspecified, based on the ָׂשַר֣
                                                     
192 Cf. 1 Sam 10:21. 
193 Cf. 1 Sam 17:56; 18:26, 27(2x). 
194 Cf. 1 Sam 22:11(2x), 14, 16, 17(2x), 18. 
 154
fact that her anchoring relation was just reaffirmed in 12:5 using the same designation.  This 
overspecification in vv. 11 and 17 seems to be thematically motivated, highlighting the very relation 
that Abraham has attempted to hide.  We construe the repetition of an anchored form of הִ֔אָּׁש  in vv. 
17, 20b and 13:1 as further evidence that the switching and overspecification observed in the context 
is intended as thematic highlighting.  Had the writer simply maintained the use of unanchored proper 
names, Sarah’s relation to Abraham would not have received explicit mention.  Due to this relation’s 
salience to the interpretation of the story, the writer/editor masterfully mixes repetition and omission 
to coincide with the knowledge of the story’s participants.  It is interesting to note that the same 
technique is used in the parallel sojourn in Gerar (cf. ‘Sarah his wife’ in Gen 20:2, compared to 
‘Sarah’ (v. 2b), ‘the woman’ in YHWH’s speech, and then back to ‘Sarah his wife’ in v. 14). 
 Another interesting switch is found in Gen 14.  ‘Bera, king of Sodom’ is introduced along 
with a number of other kings in 14:2.  Though proper names are assigned to these kings at their initial 
activation, their use is not maintained in the narrative.195  At the end of the pericope, the king of 
Sodom comes out to greet Abraham after his safe return.  ‘Melchizedek, king of Salem’ is introduced 
at this point; he too comes out to greet Abraham.   While the Bera was assigned a proper name at his 
activation, only the epithet ‘king of Sodom’ is used for subsequent reference to him (cf. vv. 10, 17, 21 
and 22).  As noted above, a proper name is typically the preferred referring expression if one is 
available, yet ‘Bera’ is not utilized.  Based on the thematic significance of Abraham’s interaction with 
Melchizedek (cf. Pss 110:4; Heb 4-6), use of the less-specific expression ‘king of Sodom’ is construed 
here as thematically motivated to assign greater prominence to the king that is referred to using a 
proper name, viz. Melchizedek.196  We noted previously that participants with proper names tend to 
play more salient roles than those referred to by epithets (cf. Sanford et al. 1988:44, 55; de Regt 
1999:3-4).  It cannot be argued in this context that ‘Bera’ would be a more specific expression since 
the designation is only used once.  However, it is plausible that the avoidance of a proper name for 
the king of Sodom is thematically motivated to background the king of Sodom.  Furthermore, the 
additional thematic information assigned to Melchizedek, combined with the marked information 
structure used to introduce him, also function to render Melchizedek relatively more prominent than 
the king of Sodom. 
 Another instance of switching referring expressions is found in Gen 14 in reference to ‘Lot’.  
Lot figures fairly prominently in the preceding narrative of Gen 13, where he separates from 
Abraham and moves near Sodom.  Lot is first referred to in Gen 14:12 as י  Lot, his‘ ֧לֹוט ֶּבן־ֲאִח֥
nephew’, thus explicitly anchoring him to Abraham.  In light of Lot’s salience in the preceding 
chapter, we interpret the anchoring information in v. 12 as redundant and therefore marked in order to 
                                                     
195 In contrast the proper name of the conquering king ‘Chedorlaomer’ is maintained in the narrative (cf. vv. 5, 9 
and 17).   
196 The fact that Melchizedek is also introduced using a referential PoD with the second anchoring relation ֖ן כֵֹה
ל ֶעְלֽיֹוןְלֵא֥  also adds prominence to this participant. 
 155
thematically highlight his relation to Abraham.  Such a view is reinforced by the participial phrase at 
the end of v. 12, ם ב ִּבְסדֹֽ  and he (was) living in Sodom’.  Lot’s captivity is the salient element‘ ְו֥הּוא יֵֹׁש֖
linking the content of Gen 14 to the larger Abraham narrative.  These marked references to Lot via 
supplemental anchoring expressions, highlight this thematic connection for the reader.  When 
Abraham is informed of Lot’s capture in v. 14, the expression יו  is substituted for Lot’s proper ָאִח֑
name.  This switch has two effects: thematically highlighting Lot’s relation to Abraham, and down-
playing his role by use of an epithet, comparable to what was observed with Sarah in Gen 12 and the 
king of Sodom in Gen 14.  It is noteworthy that Lot is referred to using a proper name throughout Gen 
13, where he acts as a major participant, further corroborating the thematic motivation for switching 
to an epithet here in 14:14. 
 Lot’s proper name is switched for an epithet again in Gen 19 in the narrative recounting the 
incestuous conception of his sons.  Lot plays a central role for much of Gen 19, as YHWH’s angels 
usher Lot and his family out of Sodom before its destruction.  However, as the narrative transitions 
from the family’s rescue to the incestuous relations, we observe several shifts of reference.  First, 
Lot’s daughters switch from being referred to collectively to being referred to individually (cf. v. 31).  
Second, rather than the daughters being anchored to Lot (cf. v. 30), Lot is anchored to his daughters 
(cf. ‘their father’, v. 33).  There are several pragmatic effects related to these switches.  First, the 
switch in anchoring corresponds with the transition in the narrative where the daughters, rather than 
Lot, become the primary initiators.  At the same time, Lot becomes a prop.  Second, switching from 
the default proper name to an anchored epithet adds thematic prominence to Lot’s salient relation as 
‘father’ in this narrative, a relation that would not have received added prominence without use of a 
marked referring expression.  In light of the incestuous relations recounted in vv. 33-36, thematically 
highlighting this relation makes perfect sense.  Such a view is confirmed by the largely redundant 
summary statement of v. 36: י ְבֽנֹות־֖לֹוט ֵמֲאִב ָ ְׁשֵּת֥ ין ַּתֲהֶר֛ ןֽוַ יֶהֽ  ‘and the two daughters of Lot conceived by 
their father’, plainly identifying Lot, ‘their father’ as the sire of the children.  There are numerous 
other examples of what we construe as the pragmatically motivated switching of referring expressions 
found in our corpus.197
 In reviewing these examples, several pragmatic effects have been identified.  First, switching 
from a proper name to an anchored epithet (e.g. ‘their father’ as in 19:33) allows the writer/editor to 
                                                     
197 E.g. Gen 16:4c (‘her mistress’ from ‘Sarai’ in 16:1); 19:1 (‘the two angels’ from ‘the men’ in 18:22, then 
back to ‘the men’ in 19:10a, and back to ‘angels’ again in 19:15, back in v. 16b); 21:8a (‘the child’ from ‘Isaac’, 
switches back in v. 8c.); 21:9 (‘the son of Hagar the Egyptian which she had born to Abraham’ rather than 
‘Ishmael’.  Ishmael is called (ostensibly) ‘his son’ in 21:11, but then shifts to ‘the child’, also in vv. 14c and 15c; 
then God hears ‘the lad’ contra expectation of hearing Hagar, in vv. 17, 20); 21:21b (‘his mother’ from ‘Hagar’ 
in vv. 14c, 17b); 22:10b (‘his son’ for ‘Isaac’); 23:12a (‘before the people of the land’ versus ‘sons of Heth’ in 
v. 10; also in v. 13a); 23:10a (‘his master’ for ‘Abraham’); 24:21, 22b, 26a, 29c, 30b, 30c, 32a,  etc. (‘the man’ 
from ‘the servant’ previously, vv. 9a, 10a, 17a); 24:15 (‘the young woman’ from ‘Rebekah’ in v. 15); 24:30a 
(‘his sister’ from ‘Rebekah’ in v. 29a); 24:52a, 53a (‘the servant of Abraham’…’the servant’, from ‘the man’ in 
v. 32a); 24:53b (‘Rebekah’ from ‘the young woman’ in v. 15); 24:53c, 55a (‘her brother’ from ‘Laban’ in v. 
29c); 24:67e (‘his mother’ from ‘Sarah’ in v. 67a). 
 156
reiterate a locally-salient anchoring relation; the use of bare proper names require a reader to access 
the participant’s anchoring relation from his or her mental representation.  Prototypically the 
anchoring relation used is the most thematically salient in the context, leading us to infer that the 
reiteration of the anchoring information indicates its thematic salience to the narrative.  Second, the 
changes made to the anchoring relations indicated a switch in the referential center of attention from 
Lot to his daughters, corresponding with the change in the daughters’ role from props to primary 
initiators.  While they were referred to as ‘the older’ and ‘the younger’, they at the same time 
remained unanchored to another participant.  The writer could have easily called them ‘his older’ for 
instance, yet did not.  This tendency of unanchored participants to play prominent, initiating roles is 
observed elsewhere in our corpus.198
6.2.2 Supplementing Referring Expressions with Additional Anchoring Information 
 Consideration will now be given to the addition of thematically salient information to a 
participant’s primary referring expression.  Most typically the supplementation involves the repetition 
of the participant’s anchoring information in a context where he or she is semi-active.  By definition, 
the anchoring information of semi-active participants is cognitively accessible.  From a cognitive 
standpoint, we would propose that readers interpret such information as marked based on the Q-
principle’s expectation that speakers not say more than is necessary.  We will begin by considering 
the supplementation of referring expressions with anchoring information, followed briefly by a 
discussion of the use of demonstratives with referring expressions. 
 Genesis 14 contains several examples of supplementation which are consistent with our 
discussion of thematic highlighting above.  In v. 13 when Abraham is notified by ‘the fugitive’ that 
Lot has been captured, the writer adds the designation י  the Hebrew’.  This is the first use of the‘ ָהִעְבִר֑
term in the Hebrew Bible, and it is not used again until Gen 39:14 and 17, where Potiphar’s wife uses 
it to describe Joseph in reported speeches.  Here in Gen 14:13 however, it does not occur in reported 
speech but in narrative, having been assigned by the writer/editor.  From a poetics perspective, the 
pragmatic effect is to infer that the narrative point of view represents the perspective of either the 
fugitive or perhaps just a generic Canaanite observer, rather than that of an omniscient Israelite 
observer. This is the first time since the death of Haran that Abraham is presented as though he were 
not the central figure of the discourse.  This shift in PoV has largely been analyzed for its source-
critical implications without consideration being given to the literary effect it achieves.199
                                                     
198 Recall the use of Lot’s proper name in Gen 13 where he plays a prominent role, compared to use of epithets 
in Gen 14, where he is essentially a prop.  Cf. the switch in anchoring relations for ‘Abraham/his master’ and 
‘the/his servant’ in Gen 24. 
199 Speiser notes the rather odd intrusion to the narrative the use of the term ‘the Hebrew’ renders, since the term 
“is not applied elsewhere in the Bible to Israelites, except by outsiders (e.g. [Gen] xxxix 14), or for self-
identification to foreigners ([Gen] xl 15, xliii 32).  Hence the fact that the author himself refers here to Abraham 
as a Hebrew is strong presumptive evidence that the document did not originate with Israelites” (Speiser 
1964:103).  Both Speiser and von Rad (1972:179) construe the use of the term ‘Hebrew’ as a remnant from an 
 157
 Point of view (PoV) is an important literary tool in Biblical Hebrew narrative.200  We see here 
how manipulation of referring expressions is utilized to achieve various effects.  Recall the earlier 
discussion about switching designations for ‘Sarai’ to ‘the woman’.  In terms of PoV, it is as though 
the reader is ‘viewing’ the story from the Egyptians’ standpoint, since it is they who would view 
Sarah as only a woman, and not as Abraham’s wife.  Similarly, the addition of the term ֑יָהִעְבִר  in Gen 
14:13 achieves a similar effect.  Van Hoek notes “that the subject of a clause is typically, or at least 
frequently, construed as the ‘viewer’ of the material in the clause” (1997:201).  In other words, van 
Hoek suggests that readers of third person narrative tend to cognitively process the information 
through the main character’s PoV, instead of through the narrator’s PoV.  We tend to forget that the 
information flow is being shaped and structured by a third party, viz. the writer/editor.  We are only 
explicitly reminded of this fact at such times that the narrator’s PoV is explicitly expressed or 
encoded.201  We would regard Gen 14:13 as an example of where the writer/editor has chosen to 
rather overtly disclose the point of view from which the story is being narrated, but the switch is 
highly appropriate given the nature of the content of Gen 14. 
 By v. 14 of Gen 14 we note that the narrative PoV has shifted back to an Abraham-centered 
perspective based on the use of 3MS pronominal suffixes to anchor participants to Abraham.  In 16b, 
we note the compound designation יו  Lot, his brother’ is used to both highlight the‘ ֨לֹוט ָאִח֤
thematically salient familial link, as well as to indicate that Abraham is once again the narrative’s 
referential center based on the fact that the other participants are anchored to him.202  This designation 
is further highlighted using information structure, being preposed for marked focus. 
 Supplementation of referring expressions is also extensively utilized in Genesis 16, the 
narrative which recounts Sarah giving Hagar to Abraham as a wife.  What is interesting to note is that 
while Sarah ostensibly changes Hagar’s salient relation from ‘handmaid’ to ‘Abraham’s wife’, the 
writer/editor never refers to Hagar as anything but a handmaid.  It is as though he is countering what 
is being communicated via the narrative’s content by reiterating her anchoring relation as ‘handmaid’.  
Sarah is reactivated in v. 1, most probably from inactivity,203 using the compound designation  ָׂ֙שַרי
ם ֶׁשת ַאְבָר֔  Sarai, Abram’s wife’.  In v. 2, both Abraham and Sarah are referenced using bare proper‘ ֵא֣
names, and Hagar is introduced in v. 1.  Thus, all participants have been successfully reactivated by 
the end of v. 2, and therefore should not need further anchoring information.  However, the writer 
manages to add an anchoring expression to all three participants in the course of v. 3: 
י  ח ָׂשַר֣ םַוִּתַּק֞ ֶׁשת־ַאְבָר֗ ּה ֶאת־ָהָג֤ר ֵאֽ ם ...ַהִּמְצִרי֙ת ִׁשְפָחָת֔ ּה ְלַאְבָר֥ ן ֹאָת֛ ּה ַוִּתֵּת֥ ה׃ִאיָׁש֖    ֥לֹו ְלִאָּׁשֽ
                                                                                                                                                                     
earlier source.  Waltke (2001) only considers the possible meaning of the term and not its potential literary 
impact. 
200 Cf. Berlin (1983:43-82) for further discussion of PoV in Biblical Hebrew narrative. 
201 For an alternative analysis of PoV, cf. van Wolde’s (1997:31f) discussion of ‘perspective’. 
202 Cf. יו יו ,’his brother‘ ָאִח֑ יו ,his house’ in v. 14‘ ֵבי֗תֹו his trained men’ and‘ ֲחִניָכ֜  and his servants’ in v. 15‘ ַוֲעָבָד֖
as further confirmation of this shift. 
203 Sarai was last mentioned in 13:1 using the designation ‘Abram’s wife’.   
 158
‘And Sarai, Abram’s wife, took Hagar, her Egyptian handmaid…and gave her to Abram, her 
husband, (to be) to him as a wife.’  
 In YHWH’s speech to Abraham in Gen 15, no details are provided to him about exactly how 
he will gain an heir.  Sarah decides, based on her claim that YHWH has closed her womb, to give her 
handmaid to Abraham as a second wife.  Hagar is clearly semi-active after v. 2, so the reiteration of 
her anchoring relation in v. 3 is reasonably construed as marked.  Based on Abraham’s speech in Gen 
24 commissioning his servant to find a wife for Isaac from among Abram’s relatives, we can also 
reasonably infer that Hagar’s nationality is also thematically salient.   
 Furthermore, the repetition of the husband and wife roles also highlights salient information, 
in light of the pericope’s content.  Specifically, the interaction of these discourse roles comes into 
play in vv. 4-5.  Here, Sarah reacts against Hagar’s treatment of her as an equal wife, despite the fact 
that the same term is used to describe their relation to Abraham.  The situation becomes comic as 
Sarah blames everything on Abraham, when the entire scheme was Sarah’s idea from the beginning.  
Even though Sarah has taken steps to change Hagar’s role from ‘handmaid’ to ‘wife’, she later rejects 
this change.  From the narrator’s PoV, we find a similar dismissal of the role change in that Hagar is 
never referred to as Abraham’s wife by the narrator.  The Angel of YHWH also avoids referring to 
Hagar as ‘Abram’s wife’, but instead seems to reaffirm her role as ‘Sarai’s handmaid’, a role which 
she also acknowledges.204   
 The highlighting of Hagar as a non-wife is incredibly salient to the balance of the Abraham 
narratives, as it relates closely to the fact that Ishmael is not the heir that YHWH has promised.  In 
16:15b, the relative clause ר ה ָהָג֖  whom Hagar bore’ is used to anchor Ishmael, highlighting‘ ֲאֶׁשר־ָיְלָד֥
his connection to Hagar as opposed to Sarah.  Though Ishmael may be Abraham’s son (cf. 
highlighting via supplementation in 17:25 and 26b), Hagar is not Abraham’s wife.  It is through 
Sarah that the promised son will come (cf. Gen 18:10ff). 
 If we move ahead to Gen 21 where the promise to Sarah is fulfilled, we observe supplemental 
anchoring information added to thematically highlight Isaac’s birth.  This information also provides a 
contrast with the themes highlighted in Gen 16.  Verse 2 reports that Sarah conceived and bore a son 
to Abraham at the time God had appointed.  The following verse relates Abraham’s naming of his 
son.  Based on the context, Isaac is the only son that is discourse active, even though Abraham has 
two sons.  Furthermore, the semantic relationship between the verbs of vv. 2-3 is such that minimal 
encoding could be used for both agent and patient in v. 3, as role change from Sarah in v. 2 to 
Abraham in v. 3 as agent is both anticipated and morphologically unambiguous.  In spite of these 
factors, reference to Abraham’s son is heavily supplemented with ה  the one‘ ַהּֽנֹוַלד־֛לֹו ֲאֶׁשר־ָיְלָדה־ּ֥לֹו ָׂשָר֖
born to him, whom Sarah had born to him’.  The thematic highlighting of this son’s relation to Sarah, 
and the syntax used to encode it, closely parallel that used to highlight Ishmael’s connection to Hagar 
                                                     
204 Cf. v. 8 יִׁשְפ ת ָׂשַר֛ ַח֥  ‘Hagar, Sarai’s handmaid’ and י י ְּגִבְרִּת֔ ְך my mistress Sarai’; v. 9‘ ָׂשַר֣  .’your mistress‘ ְּגִבְרֵּת֑
 159
in 16:15b.  Both also utilize end focus to highlight the proper names the sons are given.205  Abraham’s 
promised son is also thematically highlighted in vv. 4 and 5 by the addition of ֔נֹוְּב  ‘his son’ in a 
context where Isaac is unquestionably semi-active, if not ‘in focus’206 based on the N1 context. 
 Numerous examples of adding thematic prominence to salient relations are found in Gen 22.  
Isaac’s relationship to Abraham is highly salient in this chapter, and is thematically highlighted using 
many supplemented referring expressions.  YHWH’s speech emphasizes this relation while at the 
same time delaying the disclosure of Isaac’s name in 22:2207 ( ְבָּת֙  יְדָ֤ך ֲאֶׁשר־ָאַה֙ א ֶאת־ְיִחֽ קַקח־ָנ֠ ֶאת־ִיְצָח֔ ).  
The technique used here is similar to that pointed out in 16:15 and 21:3 above.  ֶאת־ִּבְנָ֙ך (‘your son’) 
unambiguously identifies Isaac, anchors him to Abraham, and highlights the familial relation by 
switching from the preferred proper name ‘Isaac’ to an epithet.  Isaac is redundantly anchored to 
Abraham through supplementation three times,208 and twice through substitution.209 The substitution 
coincides with thematically critical points of the discourse: raising the knife to slay ‘his son’, and to 
describe the substitution of the ram for ‘his son’.  Abraham’s relation to Isaac is also thematically 
highlighted both by substitution in Isaac’s speech (v. 7b), and through supplementation in the 
quotative frame which introduces it (v. 7a).  One could also construe the supplement in the quotative 
frame as indicating a switch in initiators, based on the nature of Isaac’s question.  Many other 
examples of thematic highlighting using supplementation could be cited from our corpus, but the 
examples discussed here are representative.210
 Now let us consider the addition of demonstrative pronouns to referring expressions.  
Levinsohn (2003:1) states that demonstrative pronouns are used as substitute referring expressions in 
many languages to differentiate thematic topics from athematic ones, with the near demonstrative 
being used for thematic topics, and the far demonstrative being used for athematic topics.  However, a 
                                                     
205 Compare the syntax and semantic of the two accounts: 
ם ֶׁשם־ְּב֛נֹו ֲאֶׁשר 16:15 א ַאְבָר֧ ן ַוִּיְקָר֨ ם ֵּב֑ ֶלד ָהָג֛ר ְלַאְבָר֖ אל׃ַוֵּת֧ ה ָהָג֖ר ִיְׁשָמֵעֽ ־ָיְלָד֥  
ק׃ 21:3 ה ִיְצָחֽ ת־ֶׁשם־ְּב֧נֹו ַהּֽנֹוַלד־֛לֹו ֲאֶׁשר־ָיְלָדה־ּ֥לֹו ָׂשָר֖ ם ֶאֽ א ַאְבָרָה֜  ַוִּיְקָר֨
206 Cf. Gundel et al. (1993:278). 
207 Two more similarly redundant references are made in the speeches of vv. 12 and 16, and using redundant 
vocatives in vv. 7 and 8. 
208 Cf. vv. 3, 6, and 9. 
209 Cf. vv. 10, 13. 
210 Other examples of supplemented referring expressions from our corpus include Gen 12:11 (‘his wife’), and 
20:2a, 14c, 18 (‘his wife’, ‘Abram’s wife’ in v. 18) where Abraham is lying about Sarah’s relation to him; 13:5 
(‘the one traveling with him’) to highlight Lot’s presence with Abraham just before conflict forces them to 
separate; 14:12a, 12c (‘Abram’s nephew…living in Sodom’) to highlight Lot’s familial relation to Abram, 
which is Abram’s motivation to rescue him; 19:25 (the description of all that was destroyed emphasizes 
comprehensiveness, but is implicit in ‘those cities’); 22:9 (‘the place that God had said to him’, contrasts with 
the more simplex phrase ‘the place’ used in v. 4b above); 22:14a (‘the name of the place that one’); 23:7 (‘to the 
people of the land, to the sons of Heth’ where ‘sons of Heth’ was used in preceding clause); 23:10b (‘in the ears 
of the sons of Heth, to all the ones entering the city gate’); 23:16b (‘the money which he had spoken in the ears 
of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver’, where money was readily accessible from the reported 
speech of v. 15); 23:19a (‘his wife’); 24:9a (Abraham his master’, cf. vv. 10a, 10c, etc); 24:30b (‘Rebekah his 
sister’, the anchored epithet ‘his sister’ is used in v. 30a); 24:59a (‘Rebekah their sister’); 24:59a (‘the servant of 
Abraham’, switches back to ‘the servant’ in v. 61d, 65a, 65b, 66a); 24:67a (‘Sarah his mother’). 
 160
different pragmatic effect is obtained when demonstratives are added to proper names instead of 
substituted.  Downing (1996:133) describes this effect as a means of the speaker distancing himself 
from the particular referent.211  The pragmatic effect is achieved ostensibly by the reader/hearer 
construing this ProperName as what is described by Gundel et al. (1993:276) as a ‘referential 
indefinite (e.g. ‘this guy walks into a bar…’).  The referential this can be used in English to introduce 
generic participants and is comparable to use of the idiom ד יׁש ֶאָח֜  ’usually rendered ‘a certain man ,ִא֨
in Biblical Hebrew.  We claimed in §4.2 that this collocation is Biblical Hebrew’s manifestation of 
the ‘referential’ level of encoding (cf. Gundel et al. 1993), indicating that the referent is identifiable to 
the speaker, but not to the hearer.  The latter must infer the referent’s existence. 
 We note a use of this ProperName found in Exod 32:1 and 23 that achieves a comparable 
pragmatic effect of distancing as described by Downing (1996:133).  Exodus 32 recounts the creation 
of the golden calf as Aaron and the Israelites’ response to Moses’ 40 day absence from the camp.  As 
the people ask Aaron to make a god for them in v. 1, and their request is supported by the statement 
ָיה ֽלֹו ְענּו ֶמה־ָה֥ א ָיַד֖ ֹ֥ ִים ל ֶרץ ִמְצַר֔ נּ֙ו ֵמֶא֣ ֱעָל֙ ר ֶהֽ יׁש ֲאֶׁש֤ ה ָהִא֗  for this Moses, the man who brought us‘ ִּכי־ֶז֣ה׀ ֹמֶׁש֣
up from the land of Egypt, we don’t know what has happened to him.’  From a linguistic point of 
view, it is as though the people are literally reactivating Moses, as though implying that they do not 
expect Aaron to remember who ‘this guy’ is.  The reactivation is accomplished using both a 
referential indefinite idiom, followed by an appositional anchor ‘the man who brought us up…’  The 
pragmatic effect is nearly identical to that achieved in English cited from Downing (1996:133), viz. 
the people distancing themselves from Moses, and implying much the same for Aaron.  Aaron uses 
the same phrasing when responding to Moses in v. 23.  Addition of the near demonstrative to a simple 
NP achieves the thematic marking described by Levinsohn,212 and thus the distancing effect seems 
restricted to use with proper NPs.  However, reconsideration may need to be given to such uses as 
ם את ִמֶּיְדֶכ֖ ֹ֛ ה this trampling’ or‘ ז ם ַהֶּז֔  this people’ in Isaiah 1:12 and 6:9-10, respectively.  The latter‘ ָהָע֣
could be construed as a distancing alternative to ‘my people’.  
6.3 Pragmatic Effects of Thematic Highlighting 
 This section will summarize the pragmatic effects achieved through the use of thematic 
highlighting which have been mentioned so far.  Callow states that one must not only identify the 
                                                     
211 She states, “First, it constitutes an avoidance of the simple proper name [the Q-principle].  Since bare proper 
names, as we have seen, are co-recognitionals, the use of Hart [i.e. a character in her corpus] here would suggest 
that speaker B considers Hart to be a member of both his own territory of information and that of speaker A.  By 
avoiding the bare name, B cancels these implicatures.  Secondly, common noun phrases involving this are 
usable in various sorts of situations where the speaker wishes to project either his/her own or his/her 
interlocutor’s lack of familiarity with the referent in question.  Such NP’s constitute a common method of 
introducing referents which are thought to be unknown to the addressee but are destined to play an important 
role in the upcoming text…; these NP’s involve the form that Gundel et al. (1993) term the ‘indefinite this’. …  
But in choosing the this-N-ProperName alternative, he is also offering to speaker A the possibility of being 
included in the group that eschews identification with Hart” (1996:133). 
212 E.g. Gen 12:7; 15:7, 18 (‘this land’); 15:5 (‘this one will not be your heir’); 17:21 (‘this season’). 
 161
marker of prominence, but also the domain over which it extends (cf. 1974:50), and thus we will 
delineate the domain based on the various effects observed in our corpus. 
6.3.1 Reorienting the Participant to the Discourse 
 We stated in §4.2 that when a participant is introduced to a discourse, it is assigned both a 
referring expression and some kind of discourse relation which anchors it in the reader’s mental 
representation, based on Givón (1992).  This anchoring relation becomes the reader’s primary means 
of relating the participant to the discourse, and remains so until discourse information directs the 
reader to do otherwise.  One of the pragmatic effects of reiterating anchoring relations for (semi-) 
active participants is to cognitively reaffirm or re-anchor the participant to the discourse.  This re-
anchoring takes two forms:  reaffirming the participant’s current discourse relation, or switching to an 
alternative, more salient discourse relation as the primary basis for relating the participant to the 
discourse.  We view participant reorientation to be more global in domain than local, in that it either 
restructures or reaffirms the reader’s mental representation of the participant. 
Reaffirming the Anchoring Relation 
 When an anchoring relation is redundantly restated without change from that which is 
cognitively instantiated, the repetition is nonetheless considered marked and assigns prominence to 
the relation.  Biblical Hebrew writers often reiterate a relation where it is thematically salient to the 
discourse, either locally or globally.  Such reiteration can be achieved using both means of thematic 
highlighting mentioned above: substitution and supplementation.  Let us consider come examples. 
 Substitution and supplementation utilizing familial relations serve to make sure that readers 
have the most salient relation in the forefront of their mental representation.  Repetition of this 
information makes sure that these relations are the primary basis used to ground the participant to the 
discourse.  Lot’s relation to Abraham is highlighted through supplementation in Gen 14:12 (‘Abram’s 
nephew…living in Sodom’), and through substitution in 14:16b (‘his relative’).  This usage is 
presumably intended to highlight the obligation Abraham has to rescue his relative.  Familial anchors 
were shown to be thematically salient in Gen 16 and 22 as well.  Heavy use of supplementation in 
both chapters ensures that the reader has what the writer deems is the most salient anchoring relation 
in mind.  In the case of Gen 16, the supplementation affirms that even though ostensibly the 
participants have changed Hagar’s salient relation to the discourse from ‘handmaid’ to ‘Abraham’s 
wife’, the writer/editor does nothing to affirm such a change.  In fact he appears to counter it by 
repeatedly anchoring Hagar to Sarah as her handmaid.   In Gen 22, the supplementations of ‘father’ 
and ‘son’ ensure that it is read as a story about a father and son, a theme which would not have 
received nearly as much prominence had only bare proper names been utilized. 
 162
 There are many other examples of how supplementation and substitution are used to highlight 
anchoring relations.213  One of the pragmatic effects of such encoding is to add prominence to the 
anchoring relation since it is either redundant, or represents a change from the default referring 
expression.  This constrains the reader to ground the participant to the discourse using the highlighted 
relation.  However, highlighting the information is not the only effect achieved by supplementation 
and substitution. 
Changing the Anchoring Relation 
 A second pragmatic effect achieved by the marked use of anchoring relations is to change the 
primary anchoring relation of a participant, effectively reorienting the reader to the participant based 
on the thematic salience of the new discourse relation.  Gen 21 contains a number of such changes.  
The complicating action of the pericope, which precipitates the expulsion of Hagar and Ishmael from 
Abraham’s camp, is Sarah seeing Ishmael mocking Isaac.  However rather than using a proper name 
to designate Ishmael in v. 9, the writer/editor states that Sarah sees  ה ית ֲאֶׁשר־ָיְלָד֥ ר ַהִּמְצִר֛ ת־ֶּבן־ָהָג֧ ֶאֽ
ם  the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she bore to Abraham’.  This designation highlights‘ ְלַאְבָרָה֖
both Ishmael’s non-Israelite roots, and only indirectly relates him to Abraham.  Gen 17 was the last 
pericope where Ishmael was referred to.  Each of the three references to him there utilize a proper 
name + ‘his son’, explicitly anchoring Ishmael to Abraham.  Thus prior to Gen 21:9, the most familiar 
relation for anchoring Ishmael to the discourse is as ‘Abraham’s son’.  Gen 21:9 not only portrays 
Ishmael ostensibly from Sarah’s PoV, but also is likely construed by readers as the most salient 
relation for this context.  Such a view is reinforced by Sarah’s subsequent demand that Abraham evict 
Hagar and ‘her son’. 
 Another relation is posited in v. 11, which recounts Abraham’s response to Sarah’s demand.  
There, Abraham refers to Ishmael as ‘his son’, an expression reflecting Abraham’s PoV as he is 
troubled about sending Hagar and ‘his son’ away.  This relation is short-lived, as references to 
Ishmael switch in God’s speech, with the writer/editor using ַהַּנַ֣ער ‘the lad’ in vv. 12, 17 (2x), 18, 19, 
and 20, with the exception of ה  son of the maid’ in v. 13.  Such encoding is consistent with‘ ֶּבן־ָהָאָמ֖
God’s PoV supporting Sarah’s demand that the two leave.  The writer/editor maintains this 
impersonal reference through the use of ַהֶּיֶ֖לד ‘the boy’ in vv. 14, 15, and in the RS of v. 16.  Thus, we 
observe one participant designated using four different appellations in a single chapter, none of which 
are a proper name!  Only the reference in v. 11 associates Ishmael with Abraham.  The other 
references either link him to Hagar, or omit any type of link to another participant (e.g. ‘boy’ or 
                                                     
213  Cf. 19:30c (‘he and his two daughters’ mentioned in a right dislocation repeated from v. 30a instead of 3MP 
minimal encoding); 19:33a, 35a (switch to ‘their/her father’ from ‘Lot’ in 19:30); 20:2a (supplements ‘his wife’ 
to ‘Sarah’); 21:3 (‘the one born to him, which Sarai had born to him’ is redundant from previous line); 21:4, 5 
(adds ‘his son’); 22:3c (‘his son’ in a detached object phrase; cf. vv. 6b, 9d (10b)); 22:7a (substitutes ‘his father’ 
for ‘Abraham’); 22:10b (substitutes ‘his son’ for ‘Isaac’); 24:30a (switch to ‘his sister’ from ‘Rebekah’ in v. 
29a). 
 163
‘lad’).  Each designation has a slightly different discourse relation, and we observed that the 
particular relations used match the PoV of the participants. 
 Other examples of changing the participant’s anchoring relation include supplementing 
Abraham’s proper name with ‘the Hebrew’ in Gen 14:13b, switching from the designation ‘the sons 
of Heth’ to ‘the people of the land’ in Gen 23:12a, and switches from ‘the servant of Abraham’ or ’the 
servant’ in Gen 24:1-17 to ‘the man’ in vv. 21-32.  After the man identifies himself as Abraham’s 
servant in v. 34, the writer/editor reverts back to calling him ‘Abraham’s servant’ (cf. v. 52ff) in the 
narrative proper.  A comparable switch is made in the reference to Rebekah in the same chapter from 
a proper name in v. 15 to ‘the young woman’ in vv. 16 and 28, and back again to a proper name in v. 
29ff.  We would propose that the purpose of these switches is more closely associated with PoV 
effects than with re-designating the participant.  Nonetheless the departure from or supplementation 
of the default referring expression inevitably adds prominence to the new designation that it would 
not otherwise have received had the expected encoding norms been followed. 
6.3.2 Indicating Center of Attention within the Discourse 
 Another pragmatic effect associated with redundant use of anchoring expressions is to 
indicate the center of attention214 within the discourse, particularly where a switch in the central 
anchoring participant is involved.  Prototypically in a narrative one participant is perceived to be the 
central participant, which we referred to as the center of reference or attention (cf. §2.4.1).  One 
explicit means of indicating the center of attention is by anchoring the secondary participants to one 
central participant, i.e. the referential center.  If participants are only referred to using bare proper 
names, determinations about the narrative’s center of attention are limited to the reader’s 
interpretation of the narrative content.  However, use of a referring expression which includes an 
anchoring relation will explicitly indicate the current center of attention.  Thus, either substitution or 
supplementation can be used to accomplish this.  Shifts in center of attention usually coincide with 
switches in initiating roles among participants.  The domain of such switches is rather local, based 
upon maintenance of the participant as the referential center. 
 We pointed out in §6.2.1 that the anchoring relations in Gen 19 switch from Lot’s daughters 
being anchored to him (cf. vv. 8-32), to Lot being anchored to his daughters as ‘their/her father’ (cf. 
vv. 33 (2x), 35, and 36).  In the first part of Gen 19, Lot and the angels are the primary initiators, with 
Lot’s daughters functioning largely as props.  In the latter part of the chapter, the daughters take the 
initiative to get their father drunk in order to have him impregnate them.  The switches in anchoring 
relations and center of attention coincide with a switch from Lot as the primary initiator of the 
narrative to the older and younger daughters as primary initiators.   
                                                     
214 For an introduction and application of ‘centering theory’, cf. Gordon et al. (1993), and Walker et al. 1998). 
 164
 One finds another such shift in Gen 24 between Abraham and his servant as Abraham 
commissions the servant to find a wife for Isaac.  The servant is anchored to Abraham initially in v. 2, 
but the pronominal suffix is dropped in subsequent references (cf. vv. 5, 9ff).  However at the point 
that the servant promises to fulfill the task in v. 9, notice the supplemented or substituted reference to 
Abraham as ‘his master’ (cf. vv. 9 and 10 (2x)).  Again, note that the switch in anchoring relations 
coincides with the switch in primary initiators.   
 Another example observed in Gen 24 is Rebekah’s relation to Laban.  Laban is initially 
anchored to the discourse as Rebekah’s brother in v. 29a, and subsequently referred to using only a 
bare proper name in vv. 29b and 32.  However, at the point that Laban rushes out to meet the servant 
at the well Rebekah’s anchoring relation switches, evidenced by substitution to ‘his sister’ in v. 30a 
and by supplementation in v. 30b (‘Rebekah, his sister’).  Clearly these are redundant anchoring 
references.   
 A final compelling example from outside of our corpus is found in Gen 3.  The woman (i.e. 
Eve) was last referred to in 2:25 in the statement “The man and his wife were both naked and not 
ashamed”, where she was anchored to Adam.  When she is first referred to in Gen 3 she is simply 
indexed as ‘the woman’ without an explicit anchor.  When Adam enters the picture in 3:6, he is 
referred to as ‘her husband’.  We would propose that the shift in anchoring is meant to highlight that 
the woman is currently the initiator, not Adam.  At the point that the two hear the sound of the LORD 
God in the garden in v. 8, the writer/editor indexes them as ‘the man and his wife’, a switch back to 
the original anchoring relations.  We conclude that the motivation for the pragmatic use of anchoring 
information is to make the switch in initiators explicit:  e.g. from Abraham to the servant, and from 
Rebekah to Laban, from Adam to the woman and back to Adam.  We do not claim that all such 
switches are meant to indicate a switch in initiators; it is simply an attested pragmatic effect in certain 
discourse contexts. 
6.3.3 Indicating the Narrator’s Point of Reference 
 The majority of switches and supplementations of anchoring expressions can be adequately 
accounted for as reorienting the participant to the discourse, or as indicating changes in the center of 
attention.  There are still other examples which fall outside the realm of these explanations, however.  
Many of the remaining tokens can be explained as explicitly indicating a change in the narrator’s 
point of view.  There is a meaningful difference between center of attention/reference and PoV.  
Using the analogy of a camera, the ‘center of attention’ describes who or what the camera lens is 
focused on, whereas PoV215 describes where the camera is, the vantage point from which the scene is 
viewed.  Prototypically in third person narrative the story is processed from the main participant’s 
                                                     
215 Cf. Berlin (1983), who uses the camera illustration to describe point of view. 
 165
PoV, as discussed in §6.2.1.216  This phenomenon is most commonly associated with deictic 
references, but is often overlooked in its more subtle manifestations as PoV.  For instance in Gen 
11:31 we find the statement: 
ם  ַרח ֶאת־ַאְבָר֣ ח ֶּת֜ ם...ַוִּיַּק֨ ן ַוֵּיְׁ֥שבּו ָׁשֽ אּו ַעד־ָחָר֖ ַען ַוָּיבֹ֥ ְרָצה ְּכַנ֔ ֶכ֙ת ַא֣ ים ָלֶל֙ ם ֵמ֣אּור ַּכְׂשִּד֗    ַוֵּיְצ֨אּו ִאָּת֜
‘And Terah took Abram… and they went out with them from Ur of the Chaldeans to go to the 
land of Canaan and they came as far as Haran and they settled there.  
One would expect that if the writer/narrator were portraying himself as embedded with the 
participants, the near deictic ‘here’ would be used to describe where they settled, as opposed to the 
‘there’.  It is as though things are being described from the vantage point of Canaan at this point, 
waiting for the participants to arrive.  On the other hand, YHWH’s commands to Abraham in 12:1ff 
are given (quite appropriately) from Abraham’s standpoint in Haran, viewing Canaan as being at a 
distance.  Finally, the use of ּבֹוא in v. 5, usually rendered as ‘came’ rather than ‘went’,217 indicates yet 
another deictic shift to within Canaan.218  
 In comparable ways we observe occasions in the corpus where the writer/editor shifts his 
PoV or vantage point from being a part of the assembled participants to being an outsider.  This idea 
was proposed in the discussion of Gen 12:14 and 15, where switching references from ‘Sarai’ to ‘the 
woman’ indicated that the writer/editor was portraying things from the Egyptians’ PoV.  This 
apparent shift lasts only as long as Abraham’s deception.  We then find her referred to only as ‘his 
wife’ until Gen 16.  A similar shift is observed as the fugitive of Gen 14:13b informs ‘Abram, the 
Hebrew’ of Lot’s capture.  Based on the limited use of this term it is difficult to understand how it 
could be construed as reorienting Abraham to the discourse.  The primary effect in this context is to 
indicate that the frame of reference for Gen 14:1ff is the Canaanite world around Abraham, rather 
than Abraham’s personal perspective.  The fact that Chedorlaomer functions as the center of reference 
in 14:1-12 further supports the appropriateness of Abraham’s reintroduction in v. 13, since he is not 
the current referential center.  However, we notice a return to Abraham as the center of reference as 
he begins the rescue of Lot in 14:14. 
 Two other switches of reference point from our corpus deserve mention.  The first is found in 
a rather awkward clause in Gen 16:4d, and is rendered in JPS as “4aAnd he went in unto Hagar, 4band 
she conceived; 4cand when she saw that she had conceivedTemp, 4dher mistress was despised in her 
                                                     
216 Cf. Van Hoek notes “that the subject of a clause is typically, or at least frequently, construed as the ‘viewer’ 
of the material in the clause” (1997:201).  For a similar claim established on the basis of poetics cf. Sternberg 
(1985:130). 
217 E.g. JPS, NASB, NKJ, NRSV, and LXX.  Other versions render it externally as ‘arrived there’ (cf. NJB, 
NIV), or ‘arrived in Canaan’ (cf. NLT). 
218 Levinsohn outlines the often overlooked deictics of verbs of motion that vary from language to language.  He 
claims, “although the Greek verbs ρχοµαι and πορεúοµαι are not always used in the same way as English 
‘come’ and ‘go’, they nevertheless denote motion with respect to some point of reference or ‘deictic center’” 
(2001:13).  One would expect these principles to be at work in Biblical Hebrew as well, even though it is not 
reflected in most lexicons. 
 166
eyes.”  Most English translations represent v. 4c as a temporal PoD.219  The repetition of the content 
of verse 4b in v. 4c creates what Dooley and Levinsohn (2001:105) refer to as ‘tail-head linkage’220 
which slows down the narrative and adds prominence to what immediately follows in the main 
clause.  We construe the grammar and the referring expression as an effort to change the point of 
reference from that of Sarah to that of Hagar; otherwise it is difficult to rationalize the change of 
referring expression for Sarah.  By using the suffixes and the anchored referring expression, Sarah is 
able to be prominently referenced without removing Hagar from the center of attention.221  
 The last example from our corpus is found in Gen 18-19. This passage contains a clear switch 
in the narrator’s PoV which is achieved using participant reference.  Specifically, there are switches 
of reference for ‘the men/angels’ who accompany YWHW during his visit to Abraham in Gen 18, and 
who eventually rescue Lot in Gen 19.  Gen 18:1 states that YHWH visited Abraham, yet the visitors 
are described as three men.  Eventually in 18:16 and 22 YHWH sends the two men off to Sodom.  
This sets the stage for Abraham to intercede for the city and for Lot.  When the men are mentioned 
again in 19:1, their referring expression is switched to ‘the two angels’.  The fact that they are 
introduced here using a definite NP leads the reader to construe these participants as co-referent with 
the two men sent by YHWH to Sodom.  This change of reference creates a knowledge gap, in that 
now the reader knows the two are divine beings, while Lot does not know.222  The two are referred to 
by both the narrator223 and participants224 as human ‘men’ until shortly after they reveal a supernatural 
power by blinding the men of Sodom (cf. v. 15).  Thus, we would argue that the initial reference to 
‘angels’ in v. 1 is intended to inform the reader of their true identity.  Reference to these participants 
as humans presents the story from Lot’s PoV, whereby he is ‘entertaining angels unaware’.  This 
maintenance of reference based on participants’ knowledge is also consistent with switches of 
referring expressions observed in Gen 12 and 20 concerning ‘Sarah’ versus the ‘woman’. 
6.3.4 Conclusions Regarding Thematic Highlighting 
 Context is crucial in determining which pragmatic effects are achieved by the use of marked 
participant encodings.  In the case of a phrase such as, ‘Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law’, any of the 
pragmatic effects previously mentioned are possible:  (re)iteration of the participant’s role, 
(re)iteration of the center of attention, or changes in point of view.  A process of elimination may be 
used in isolating the most plausible effect(s) achieved in the context.  For instance, if the center of 
attention remains static on one participant in the discourse, it is unlikely that affirming the center of 
                                                     
219 Cf. NASB, JPS, NET, NIV, NJB, NKJ, NLT, NRSV. 
220 Cf. Dooley and Levinsohn’s discussion on the use of tail-head linkage as a pre-climax highlighting device 
(2001:105). 
221 Cf. Foley and Van Valin (1984) for a discussion about the similar use of passive constructions to maintain 
attention on one participant, even though he/she is not the agent.

Sternberg (1985:183ff).

 167
attention is the intention.  Highlighting the thematic role or relation is likely the more salient 
pragmatic effect.  However, in a context such as Gen 27 which makes eight discrete switches in 
center of attention, the switching function is likely as salient as the highlighting of roles, and perhaps 
more so.  ‘Switching’ centers of reference appears to be a much more localized device, compared to 
the domain of thematically highlighting a role.  Point of view effects are largely determined by 
consistency of referential center as determined by the referring expressions.  As observed in Gen 12 
and 14, it was the lack of an anchoring relation to other participants that indicated the switch of 
reference.  More will be said about these issues in our application of these principles to Gen 27 in the 
Chapter 7. 
6.4 Cataphoric Highlighting 
6.4.1 Introduction 
 Section 6.1.2 provided an introduction to the idea of ‘prominence’, and proposed a cognitive 
account of how elements are judged and processed as prominent by readers.  Section 6.2 described 
the use of prominence in Biblical Hebrew narrative to thematically highlight information.  In these 
cases, default lexical encoding was either substituted or supplemented.  It was argued that such 
encoding pragmatically draws attention to the non-default information.  The use of default lexical 
NPs used where minimal encoding is expected has so far only been attributed to the processing 
function (cf. Chapter 5).  However, cognitive processing cannot account for all of the overencoding 
data observed in our corpus.  The remaining tokens fall into two categories. 
 First, there are instances where active agents and patients are both overencoded in a clause, 
especially in quotative frames.  This encoding exceeds the requirements for signaling a new 
development (e.g. Gen 14:22).225  Second, there are instances where the overencoding of participants 
in context S1 is found in consecutive clauses (e.g. Gen 13:11a-b), ostensibly dividing the clauses into 
two distinct developments.  How are these two kinds of tokens to be analyzed?  Are they marked 
developments, given more prominence than normal due to the presence of additional encoding?   
 Levinsohn claims that there are two reasons for overencoding participants in certain discourse 
contexts, based upon Givón’s (1983a) iconicity principle: 
1. “to mark the beginning of a narrative unit (because, in Givón’s terms, there is a 
discontinuity); or 
2. to highlight the action or speech concerned (often, because it is disruptive or surprising)” 
(2000b:4). 
Huang (2000:230) reaches similar conclusions, stating that “contrastiveness or being contrary to 
expectation” is an effect associated with use of marked forms.   
                                                     
225 Overencoding for processing appears to be restricted to the overencoding of agents, based on the conclusions 
reached by most empirical cognitive studies cited above.  Preliminary data from our corpora give some reason to 
conclude that overencoding in certain N- contexts may be used to disambiguate whether some context S3 or S4 
transitions should be read as a new developments or not (cf. Levinsohn 2000b:9, and his analysis of Gen 4:6). 
 168
 One discourse context that is often pragmatically marked according to Longacre (1996:132) 
is what he refers to as a ‘countering move’ in reported speech, whereby one participant’s speech 
either counters the goals or objectives of the other, or simply initiates a new direction in the dialogue.  
Dooley and Levinsohn cite several attested means of grammaticalizing countering moves: “In Koiné 
Greek, for instance, the verb apokrínomai, which is usually glossed ‘answer’, typically signals a 
change of direction in a reported conversation…  In languages that use a developmental marker, this 
marker is likely to be used in connection with a change of direction in a reported conversation.  It is 
normal, also, for a noun to refer to the speaker of such a speech, even when a pronoun would 
otherwise be expected” (2001:100-101).   
 Thus, even though a reader may be able to determine from the content of a speech that it 
represents a shift in direction compared to that of the preceding speech, many languages add 
pragmatic markers to highlight such a shift using development or other pragmatically assigned 
markers.  Levinsohn (2000a:140ff) has found the highlighting function of overencoding used not just 
in countering moves, but more generally to cataphorically highlight a following speech or event.  In 
other words, the overencoding of participants can be used to pragmatically add prominence to a 
following speech or event that it would not naturally have had without the marked encoding.  
Levinsohn applied these principles to Koine Greek (2000a:140ff), and found that overencoding is 
regularly utilized as a cataphoric marker to highlight a following speech or event, not the participant 
that has been overencoded.  De Regt (1999:60-62) reaches similar conclusions regarding the series of 
relexicalizations in Ruth (2:20-22) and in the Joseph narratives (Gen 42:6-9), as does Perrin 
(1978:110-111), with both observing that use of such overencoding occurs just before the climax of 
the narrative.226
 It was argued in §2.5.4 that Huang’s revised neo-Gricean pragmatic scheme, combined with 
Dooley and Levinsohn’s three functions of participant reference,227 appear to form a cognitive 
processing scheme whereby lower level functions are entailed in those above them, repeated below: 
(27) Entailment Hierarchy for Cognitive Processing of Marked Referring Expressions 
 
Semantic  Processing  Pragmatic 
 
In other words, when a reader encounters a redundant NP, the expression still plays a semantic role.  
However, based on its redundancy it is construed as serving some other pragmatic function than 
simple disambiguation.  The overencoded tokens are interpreted as such based on their departure from 
the established discourse patterns (cf. the theoretical frame of reference discussed in §6.1).  Cognitive 
                                                     
226 “Like Judg 3:20-22 and, e.g., Gen 25:34a and 29:10-12 (‘Jacob’), Ruth 2:20-22 seems to serve as a climactic 
point in the text, indicated by the repetition of full references to participants.  Such a peak potentially brings 
about a crucial change in the course of events.  In general, devices of repetition often mark a peak, ‘i.e., various 
devices are used to insure that the peak does not “go by too fast”’” (De Regt 1999:61, citing Longacre 
1989:349). 
227 These functions are semantic, processing, and discourse-pragmatic. 
 169
research has demonstrated that overencoding of active participants is first construed as marking a new 
segment.  The overencoding guides the reader to chunk the text in their mental representation.  Based 
on the claims of Levinsohn (2000a) and Dooley and Levinsohn (2001:100-101), we are postulating 
that overencoding which exceeds the discourse-established patterns to mark new developments moves 
the reader to the next level of the anaphora resolution scheme—pragmatic highlighting.  We would 
further argue that such lexical overencoding functions to cataphorically highlight a following event or 
speech by creating a marked development unit, something on the order of a ‘pragmatic speed bump’ 
to slow readers down and get their attention.  Longacre’s (1996:132) claim regarding countering 
moves appears to be a specific application of this more general principle of cataphoric highlighting. 
 The number of tokens in the corpus of Gen 12-25 which utilize cataphoric highlighting is 
rather limited.  Most are observed in quotative frames in contexts where there is a shift in initiators 
within the dialogue.  A few are found just before a thematically salient event, which is consistent with 
Dooley and Levinsohn’s description.  We first observed the marking of countering moves and 
cataphoric highlighting through repeated S1 lexicalization in our test corpus of Exod 1-12.  This 
corpus includes many more contexts where participants resist the initiative of another.  Only a few 
comparable situations are found in the Genesis corpus:  Abraham’s refusal to accept booty from the 
king of Sodom in Gen 14:22, Abraham’s rejection of responsibility for Hagar in 16:6; and Abraham’s 
continuing reduction in the number of righteous necessary for a city to be spared in 18:27, 29.228  
Several examples will be presented which illustrate the cataphoric highlighting of a following speech 
or event.  Two tokens are taken from the Exodus test corpus.  We begin with cataphoric highlighting 
in context S1. 
6.4.2 Cataphoric Highlighting in Narrative 
 In Exodus 2:23b-25, just prior to YHWH’s revelation of Himself to Moses, there are a series 
of statements describing YHWH’s awareness and concern for Israel in response to their outcry: 
ה׃23 ים ִמן־ָהֲעבָֹדֽ ם ֶאל־ָהֱאֹלִה֖ ַעל ַׁשְוָעָת֛ קּו ַוַּת֧ ה ַוִּיְזָע֑ ל ִמן־ָהֲעבָֹד֖ י־ִיְׂשָרֵא֛   ַוֵּיָאְנ֧חּו ְבֵנֽ
ע 24 יםַוִּיְׁשַמ֥ ר ֱאֹלִה֖ ם ַוִּיְזּכֹ֤ םֱאֹלִהי֙ם ֶאת־ַנֲאָקָת֑   ... ֶאת־ְּבִרי֔תֹו ֶאת־ַאְבָרָה֖
יםַוַּי֥ ְרא 25 ים ַוֵּי֖ ַדע לֶאת־ְּבֵנ֣י ִיְׂשָרֵא֑ ֱאֹלִה֖   ׃ֱאֹלִהֽ
23And the sons of Israel (S4) groaned from the labor and cried out and their cry (S3) went up to 
God (N4) from the labor.  
24And God (S3) heard their cry (N3), and God (S1) remembered his covenant (N4) with 
Abraham… 
25And God (S1) saw the sons of Israel (N3), and God (S1) knew.  
Verse 23 introduces the entities that will switch roles in v. 24:  the sons of Israel, their cry, and God.  
Based on the semantics of ‘their cry went up to God’, the expectation is that ‘God’ would be the agent 
hearing ‘the cry’ in v. 24, a simple S3/N3 role switch disambiguated by the fact that God is the only 
animate participant.  Certainly only the subject needs to be relexicalized to disambiguate the switch.  
                                                     
228 A complex quotative frame is used in both instances, without lexicalizing the addressee. 
 170
We are proposing that the string of S1 relexicalizations in vv. 24-25, in addition to simply segmenting 
the text, are most likely processed by readers as intending some other marked implicature that 
minimal encoding would not have achieved.  We claim this implicature is the cataphoric highlighting 
of God coming down to do something about all that He has heard and seen (cf. Exod 3ff).  Also note 
the relexicalization of ‘sons of Israel’ in v. 25a, in a context where they are the only salient 3MP 
referent, based on the pronominal suffixes used in v. 24a.  In contrast in v. 25b, the complement of 
what God knew is elided, leaving it to the reader to supply an antecedent.  This passage illustrates not 
only the effective use of cataphoric highlighting, but also the Biblical Hebrew writer/editor’s literary 
capabilities. 
 We find a similar example of S1 relexicalization in Gen 13:10ff used to highlight Lot’s 
decision to choose Sodom rather than Canaan, in response to Abraham’s offer. 
הט֣לֹוַוִּיָּׂשא־10 ה ֶאת־ְסדֹ֙ם ְוֶאת־ֲעֹמָר֔ ת ְיהָו֗ ה ִלְפֵנ֣י׀ ַׁשֵח֣ ּה ַמְׁש ֶק֑ י ֻכָּל֖ ן ִּכ֥ ר ַהַּיְרֵּד֔ יו ַוַּיְר֙א ֶאת־ָּכל־ִּכַּכ֣     ֶאת־ֵעיָנ֗
ַער׃ ה צֹֽ ִים ּבֲֹאָכ֖ ֶרץ ִמְצַר֔   ְּכַגן־ְיהָו֙ה ְּכֶא֣
ר ַהַּיְרֵּד֔֗לֹוטַוִּיְבַחר־֣לֹו 11 ת ָּכל־ִּכַּכ֣ ע  ֵא֚ ֶדם֖לֹוטן ַוִּיַּס֥   ... ִמֶּק֑
10And Lot (S2) lifted his eyes and saw (S1) all of the Jordan valley, that all of it was well-
watered before God destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, like YHWH’s garden, like the land of 
Egypt as you go to Zoar.  
11And Lot (S1) chose for himself all the Jordan valley and Lot (S1) set out eastward… 
The relexicalization in v. 10 is construed as overencoded, serving to segment Lot’s response to 
Abraham’s speech.  A large amount of thematically salient information is presented in the subordinate 
clauses of v. 10, far beyond what is necessary for disambiguation, but exactly the kind of encoding 
one might expect for thematically highlighting the valley.229  Longacre notes that such thematic 
background information is often placed just prior to a climax as a means of delaying resolution and 
building up the suspense in a narrative (1985:86).  The inclusion of this information in Gen 13 is also 
highly salient for understanding the events in the very next chapter.  The twofold relexicalization in v. 
11, while serving to segment the text, goes beyond what is reasonably expected and attested 
elsewhere in our corpus.  Thus the encoding can be reasonably understood as explicitly adding 
prominence to information which is salient to the discourse.  This marked encoding is also found in 
the context of corroborative highlighting markers, viz. the thematically-salient off-line information.230
                                                     
229 Levinsohn (1992) claims that postposed as- and when- clauses are used in English to convey information that 
is at least as salient as that in the main clause.  Heimerdinger (1999:94ff) makes similar claims regarding the 
salience of so-called ‘off-line’ material in Biblical Hebrew narrative.   
230 For other examples of the insertion of redundant, thematically-salient off-line information, cf. Gen 14:17 (the 
description of Chedorlaomer); 19:4 (description of men of Sodom); 19:29 (reference to Lot living in the cities 
which were destroyed); 21:1, 2 (the ‘just as the LORD said’ statements; cf. Exod 7:10; 9:12, 35; 12:28, 50); 21:3 
(the specification of Sarah as the birth mother); 22:3, 9 (description of the place as ‘where God had told him’); 
23:13 (reiteration of the bystanders who were listening); 23:19, 20; 25:9-10 (description of which cave was used 
as a burial place). 
 171
6.4.3 Cataphoric Highlighting in Quotative Frames 
 The previously described examples from Exod 2 and Gen 13 illustrate the use of cataphoric 
highlighting in context S1, but comparable highlighting is frequently observed in context S2 as well.  
Consider Moses’ first audience with Pharaoh to obtain the freedom of the Israelites, recorded in Exod 
5:1-6 
ר ְיהָו֙ה 1 ה־ָאַמ֤ ה ּכֹֽ ן ַוּיֹאְמ֖רּו ֶאל־ַּפְרעֹ֑ ה ְוַאֲהרֹ֔ אּו ֹמֶׁש֣ ר ָּב֚ י...ְוַאַח֗   ...ַׁשַּל֙ח ֶאת־ַעִּמ֔

1And afterward Moses and Aaron (S3) came and said to Pharaoh (N4), “Thus says YHWH, ‘Let 
my people go…’”  
2And Pharaoh (S2) said (to Ø), “Who is YHWH that I should obey his voice to let Israel go…” 
3And Ø (S2) said (to Ø), “The God of the Hebrews met with us.  Let us go three days journey… 
4And the King of Egypt (S2) said to them (N2), “Why, Moses and Aaron, do you cause to 
refrain… 
5And Pharaoh (S1) said (to Ø), “Look, many now are the people of the land, and you want them 
to… 
The relexicalization of Pharaoh’s reply in v. 2 appears to be a simple development marker, eliding the 
addressees.  He has not yet rejected Moses and Aaron’s proposal, but the frame introducing Pharaoh’s 
question is segmented to mark it as a distinct development from what precedes.  The frame 
introducing Moses and Aaron’s reply in v. 3 uses minimal encoding for both speaker and addressee, 
while the frames of v. 4-5 seem to mark a shift.  Both relexicalize the speaker, and the former 
explicitly encodes the addressee.231  This view is bolstered by the mid-speech reorienting in v. 5, 
which not only segments the Pharaoh’s speech into two parts, but also adds prominence to the latter 
portion that use of only a single quotative frame to introduce the speech would not have achieved.  
Notice also the switch of referring expression from ‘Pharaoh’ to ‘king of Egypt’, a move to ensure 
that the reader is processing this struggle between YHWH/Moses and Pharaoh as more than just 
interpersonal; the future welfare of Egypt is at stake based on its king’s decisions. 
 Another token of overencoding a countering move is found in Gen 14:22, where Abraham 
rejects the king of Sodom’s offer of booty. 
אֶמר  ֹ֥ םַוּי ם ֶאל־ַאְבָר֖ ֶלְך ְסדֹ֑ י ֶאל־ְיהָו֙הֶמ֣ ִתי ָיִד֤   ... ֲהִריֹמ֨
And Abram (S2) said to the king of Sodom (N2), “I have raised my hand to YHWH…” 
The speech between the king of Sodom and Abraham is initiated in v. 21, where the king offers the 
goods Abraham has recovered to him as a reward.  Abraham rejects this offer outright.  His rejection 
                                                     
231 As noted in §4.4.1, Nariyama (2000) argues that zero anaphora is used cross-linguistically as the unmarked 
signal of continuity.  A great many non-initial quotative frames elide the addressee using zero anaphora, which 
would have the pragmatic effect of signaling ‘+continuity’ according to Nariyama’s view.  Thus, it is reasonable 
to conclude that the explicit pronominal mention of the addressee has the pragmatic effect indicating some 
degree of discontinuity with the preceding conversational turn, especially based on the fact that both vv. 2 and 3 
elide the addressee using zero anaphora.

coincides with the overencoding of both speaker and hearer in a context where minimal encoding is 
default for both.  We would propose that the pragmatic effect of this degree of overencoding is to add 
prominence to Abraham’s reply that it would not otherwise have had.  This is what Longacre (1996) 
refers to as a countering move.  Not only does the encoding serve to segment Abraham’s reply as a 
distinct development, it also adds prominence to it due to the overencoding of the addressee.  Thus 
the use of overencoding here complements the content of the speech which follows. 
 One final example of the overencoding of an active speaker and hearer in a quotative frame is 
found in Gen 16:6.  This verse recounts Abraham’s reply to Sarah’s complaint about Hagar 
disrespecting her.  Sarah goes so far as to blame the problem on Abraham.  Based on the discourse 
context, Sarah’s complaint seems out of place in that it was her idea for Abraham to approach Hagar 
in the first place.  Abraham’s reply is encoded as if it is a countering move, yet he does nothing but 
acquiesce to his wife’s complaint: 
אֶמר  5 ֹ֨ יַוּת י ָעֶליָךֶ֒אל־ַאְבָר֮ם ָׂשַר֣ אֶמר  6 ... ֲחָמִס֣ ֹ֨ םַוּי יָׂש ֶאל־ַאְבָר֜   ...ַר֗
5 And Sarai (S1) said to Abram (N4), “My wrong is on you…” 6and Abram (S2) said to Sarai 
(N2)… 
 Commentators seem to expect some courageous decision from Abraham here, especially in 
light of the Ancient Near Eastern legal precedents.232  Waltke states, “Like Eve, Sarah now shifts the 
blame, and like Adam, Abraham shrugs off responsibility.  Abraham alone has the judicial authority 
to effect a change and up to now has not acted to protect their marriage” (2001:252).233  Von Rad 
goes further stating, “But what happens—Sarah’s outbursts of anger, Abraham’s surrender of Hagar 
to Sarah’s reprisal—is in the narrator’s opinion disagreeable” (1972:192, italics mine).  Von Rad 
does not elaborate on the textual evidence which leads him to this opinion.  We would construe the 
overencoded quotative frame introducing Abraham’s response as adding prominence to the speech 
which follows.  The overencoding seems to anticipate a countering move, as noted by the 
commentators; surprisingly, it is never delivered. 
6.4.4 Conclusions Regarding Cataphoric Highlighting 
 Based on the tokens presented both from our primary corpus and from our test corpus of 
Exodus 1-15, we conclude that the repeated relexicalization in S1, as well as the relexicalization of 
both speaker and addressee in context S2/N2, is intended to create some pragmatic effect other than 
simply indicating a new development.  Based on the discourse context of each token, the location of 
the overencoding was either near or at a point of highest tension in the story.  We do not claim that 
such overencoding is required to grammaticalize a countering or surprising move in a reported 
speech.  However, it clearly represents an option to pragmatically add prominence to a speech by 
utilizing encoding in excess of that necessary to signal a new development.  Similarly, the repeated 
                                                     
232 Cf. Walton (2001:447f) for a thorough discussion on this issue. 
233 Ross (1996:320) characterizes Abraham’s actions as a “surrendering agreement”. 
 173
relexicalization in S1 serves to segment each clause into its own new development unit, with the 
pragmatic effect of adding prominence to each clause.  This prominence would not have been present 
if the clauses had been minimally encoded within a single, unified development unit.  Viewing this 
kind of overencoding through the lens of the pragmatic processing of anaphora, and informed by 
cross-linguistic principles, our theoretical frame of reference is able to provide a reasonable account 
of the remaining body of marked encoding from our corpus. 
6.5 Conclusion 
 This chapter has provided an account of the remaining group of overencoded tokens from our 
corpus, encoding which exceeded the cross-linguistic and empirical expectations to indicate a new 
development.  It was postulated that encoding in excess of that required to indicate a new 
development is construed by readers as accomplishing some pragmatic effect other than processing.  
This framework is based on the cross-linguistic functions of participant reference postulated by 
Dooley and Levinsohn (2001), and informed by the revised Neo-Gricean principles which we 
demonstrated are attested in diverse languages.  The proposed pragmatic effect of such overencoded 
development units is to cataphorically highlight a salient speech or event which follows.  It was noted 
that empirical studies of anaphora have largely focused on differentiating the processing of 
pronominal versus nominal reference to active agents/subjects, and has not extended to overencoded 
lexical forms or the overencoding of patients.  Therefore this framework relies upon firmly 
established cognitive and pragmatic principles, as well as usage attested in other languages.   
 The application of this theoretical framework to the remaining overencoded tokens from our 
corpus resulted in distinguishing two distinct functions of overencoding in addition to marking 
development units.  The functions can be differentiated by the kind of encoding involved.  On the one 
hand, the substitution or supplementation of referring expressions has the pragmatic effect of 
thematically highlighting the added information itself.  On the other hand, overencoding both the 
agent and the patient, or consecutively overencoding the agent, has the pragmatic effect of 
cataphorically highlighting a following speech or event.  Our conclusions are summarized in the 
following definitions. 
Thematic highlighting:  Assigns added prominence to information that is crucial to 
understanding the interpretive point of the story.  Thematic highlighting places the spotlight 
on the added information itself. 
 
Cataphoric highlighting:  Cataphorically adds prominence to surprising or important 
developments.  Cataphoric highlighting places the spotlight on a following speech or event, 
not on the added information itself. 
 Based on the analysis of the thematic highlighting tokens, several possible pragmatic effects 
were noted depending on the discourse context.  First, thematic highlighting can have the pragmatic 
effect of reorienting an active or semi-active participant to the discourse based on the anchoring 
relation specified by the writer/editor.  Second, thematic highlighting can explicitly indicate the 
 174
referential center, which prototypically coincides with the current center of attention/initiating 
participant.  Finally, thematic highlighting can also serve to indicate shifts in PoV, the vantage point 
from which the narrative is being recounted.  In the case of cataphoric highlighting, the primary 
pragmatic effect is to add prominence to a following speech or event by creating a marked segment 
which serves to ‘slow down’ the pace of the narrative.   
 Our study began by highlighting the need for a typologically informed, empirical account of 
participant reference in Biblical Hebrew narrative, based on the gaps left from previous studies in 
Chapters 2 and 3.  The default encoding constraints and default forms for the various discourse 
contexts were described in Chapter 4.  This default description served as the baseline for both 
isolating and describing marked forms of participant encoding.  In the process, it was noted that the 
corpus exhibited overencoding of participants in contexts where minimal forms are expected.  
Chapter 5 described the use of redundant lexical NP references to active participants as Biblical 
Hebrew’s means of segmenting a narrative into distinct developments in contexts of relative 
continuity.  This current chapter has provided a description of the remaining overencoded data as 
either thematic highlighting or cataphoric highlighting.   
 Thus far our model has only been applied to our corpus one layer at a time, viz. default 
encoding, marked encoding for processing and marked encoding for discourse-pragmatic functions.  
With our account of participant reference completed, the next chapter is devoted to a unified analysis 
of Gen 27 in order to demonstrate how the pieces fit together, as well how the pragmatic use of 
participant reference complements and interacts with the use of other discourse conventions.
