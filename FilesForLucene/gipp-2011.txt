Abstract 
This updated and revised paper gives an overview of my PhD research. It 
focuses on two newly developed approaches. Citation Proximity Analysis 
(CPA) allows the identification of related work by analyzing the co-occurrence 
of citations within documents. In contrast to co-citation analysis various factors, 
such as the proximity of citations to each other, are taken into account. The 
second approach is called Citation based Plagiarism Detection (CbPD). In 
comparison  to the currently used text-based plagiarism detection approaches 
this citation- analyzing approach enables a better detection rate in identifying 
plagiarism forms such as paraphrasing, translations and idea plagiarism.

1   Introduction & Motivation 
The search for related work is such a time-consuming procedure, that even when 
performed by experienced scientists, it often leads to unsatisfying results. To alleviate 
the problem, search engines such as Google Scholar and Citeseer offer to display 
‘related documents’.  
The best results are usually achieved by hybrid research paper recommender 
systems. By combining techniques such as citation analysis, co-word analysis, 
collaborative filtering, and Subject-Action-Object (SAO) structures, 
recommendations can be given. However, these approaches are only suitable to a 
limited extent for identifying related work [1, 10, 2, 8, 11, 6, 13]. According to our 
examinations, for scientific documents, the best results can usually be achieved by 
applying the citation-based bibliographic coupling and co-citation analysis. 
The aim is to develop new citation-based approaches in order to identify related 
documents and plagiarism. So far, two new approaches have been developed, called 
Citation Proximity Analysis (CPA) and Citation based Plagiarism Detection (CbPD). 
CPA is a further development of co-citation analysis, whereas CbPD is based on 
bibliographic coupling, but in addition, analyzes the order of citations.

Figure 1: GUI SciPlore – clustering related documents 
In the research paper recommender system SciPlore.org, these approaches are 
mainly used for two purposes. First, to identify related documents as shown in Figure 
1; and secondly, to give recommendations for related documents based on one or 
more documents the user has been interested in, as shown in Figure 2. 
 
Based on document usage mining, Scienstein recommends

Figure 2: Recommendation of related papers 
Throughout this document two types of semantic relatedness are distinguished. I 
adopt the perspective of Resnik and consider ‘similarity’ as a special case of semantic 
relatedness [9]. Two documents, for instance, are related if they address the same 
research question. Two documents are related and similar if they are, for instance, 
duplicates, plagiarized or translated.  
In the first part of this paper, related work is presented and currently applied 
citation analysis approaches discussed. In the next section the research design is 
presented. Afterwards, the CPA and CbPD are introduced and compared in regard to 
their suitability for Academic Recommender Systems. The paper concludes with a 
summary and an outlook. 
2   Proposed Research & Related Work 
The usefulness of a research paper recommender system depends to a large extent 
on its ability to automatically determine related documents to one or more documents. 
Various approaches exist to measure the degree of relatedness in order to identify 
related work.  
Whereas text-mining approaches are used in cases in which references are not 
stated, citation analysis approaches usually deliver superior results, as e.g. synonyms 
and unclear nomenclature do not lead to misleading results [1, 2, 8]. Many citation 
analysis approaches exist and they all have their own strengths and weaknesses for 
identifying related documents. Among the most widely used are the easily applicable 
‘cited by’ approach, which considers papers as relevant that cite the same input 
document and the ‘reference list’ approach, which considers papers relevant that were 
referenced by the input document. Better results can usually be obtained by 
bibliographic coupling and co-citation analysis, which allow calculating the coupling 
strength [11]. These approaches, which were already invented in the 60s and 70s, are 
used by scientists and by academic search engines like CiteSeer1 [3].

Figure 3: Bibliographic coupling (left) and Co-citation (right) 
Documents are bibliographically coupled if they cite one or more documents in 
common. Figure 3 (left) illustrates this approach: Papers A and B are related because 
they both cite papers 1, 2 and 3. 
In contrast, two documents are ‘co-cited’ when at least one paper cites both. This 
approach is illustrated in Figure 3 on the right: Papers A and B are related because 
they are both cited by papers 1, 2 and 3. The more co-citations two papers receive, the 
more related they are [11]. 
Although both approaches are suitable to identify related papers, they serve 
different purposes. Whereas bibliographic coupling is retrospective, co-citation is 
essentially a forward-looking perspective [3]. However, both approaches often deliver 
unsatisfying results, since they only make use of the bibliography at the end of the 
document without analyzing the constellation of citations. Therefore, it is not possible 
to determine in which part of a related document the content of interest can be found.   
3   Research Questions 
I want to answer the following three research questions in order to improve Academic 
Paper Recommender Systems.

5   First Results 
Two new approaches called Citation Proximity Analysis (CPA) and Citation based 
Plagiarism Detection (CbPD) have been developed. CPA is a variant of co-citation 
analysis that additionally considers the proximity of citations to each other within an 
article’s full-text. The underlying idea is that the closer citations are to each other in a 
document, the more likely it is that the cited documents are related. For example, 
citations listed in the same sentence are more likely to express related thoughts than 
citations listed only in the same section. In CbPD, the pattern, order, co-occurrence 
etc. of citations is analyzed, allowing the identification of a text that has been 
translated from language A to language B, as the citations remain in a similar or even 
identical order. 
Citation Proximity Analysis (CPA) 
Instead of just using the bibliography, in CPA the proximity of the citations to each 
other in the full-text is used to calculate the Citation Proximity Index (CPI) in three 
steps. 
 
1. The document is parsed and a series of heuristics are used to process the 
citations, including their position within the document2. 
2. The citations are assigned to their corresponding items in the bibliography. 
The overall margin of error with the system we have developed equals nearly 
three percent for the first and second step. 
3. In the third step the proximity among each citation-pair is examined.  
 
The underlying assumption is that the closer the citations are to each other, the 
more likely it is that they are related. Based on this proximity analysis, the CPI is 
calculated. If for example two citations are given in the same sentence, the probability 
that they are related is higher (CPI = 1) than if they are cited only within the same 
paragraph (CPI = ¼). See Figure 4.

However, further research needs to be performed to identify the appropriate 
weighting of the CPI values according to their occurrence, which also seems to

depend on the publication’s research field or type. It seems, for instance, that for 
analyzing a technical report or patent specification, different weightings seem more 
suitable than for a research article.  
The results delivered by CPA can be improved by evaluating as many sources as 
possible. This can be the case due to multiple occurrences of the same citation and 
due to multiple documents citing a certain document. In our series of tests we 
experienced the best results by calculating the weighted average of the CPIs. By 
automating the process described above, we have calculated the CPI for publications 
contained in the SciPlore database. The results show that in comparison to the results 
delivered by co-citation analysis, CPA delivers considerably better results in 
identifying related documents [4]. 
The same principle can be applied to links on websites or to quotations instead of 
citations (Quotation Proximity Analysis). If passages of two documents are quoted by 
a third document, the quoted documents are likely to be related. The closer the 
quotations are within the text of the quoting document, the higher the assumed 
relatedness as illustrated in the following figure.

Figure 5: Quotation Proximity Analysis 
 
The ‘Review of Fantasy’ book quotes passages from two different editions of 
‘Lord of the Rings’ and of ‘Harry Potter.’ Between the quotes of the different ‘Lord 
of the Rings’ volumes only one sentence occurs. Therefore, a relatively high 
relatedness of these two quotes/quoted books can be assumed. In contrast, the 
distance between the quote from ‘Harry Potter’ and the ‘Lord of the Rings’ is larger. 
Therefore, the relatedness of these quotes and the quoted books can be assumed to be 
lower, but still higher as if they would not appear at all in the same document. A 
modification of the approach also allows classifying unknown documents based on 
containing quotes. In the example, the ‘Review of Fantasy Books’ could be classified 
automatically if at least one of the quoted books has already been classified. This is 
especially useful for documents not containing references or quotes as for instance in 
novels. 
Citation based Plagiarism Detection 
Similar to the idea of CPA is another approach, which I call Citation based 
Plagiarism Detection (CbPD) or Citation Order Analysis [5]. Hundreds of papers have 
been published covering sophisticated approaches to detect plagiarism, and dozens of 
applications have been developed. All of them use more or less sophisticated 
approaches to analyze the text, but ignore the used citations [7, 12]. These approaches 
deliver good results in detecting copied text passages, but fail if text has been 
paraphrased or translated as shown in Figure 6.

In contrast to CPA, in CbPD mainly uses factors such as citation order and pattern 
analysis. The main advantage in comparison to the usually applied text-analysis 
approaches is that even if documents were translated or paraphrased they can still be 
identified as similar. Figure 7 and Figure 8 illustrate the concept.

Figure 8: Illustration of Citation Order Analysis 
A comparison with the existing approaches is problematic, as both approaches 
have their own strengths. Whereas text-based approaches detect local similarity, like 
copied sentences, this citation-based approach analyzes global similarity. The 
interpretation, for instance, of a precision and recall value only makes sense when 
compared to other approaches. Since no other approaches exist for paraphrased and 
translated scientific text, such a comparison is not feasible. The test sets, like the 
PAN-PC-10 that was used at the
 
Competition on Plagiarism Detection in 2010, are 
tailored to compare the performance of classical plagiarism detection systems, but are 
unsuitable to test this new approach, because citations were ignored.  
To evaluate our approach, we ran a test on 0.8 million scientific publications from 
open access repositories and hid among them 20 specially-designed plagiarized 
documents. To create a more realistic test scenario, we deleted some citations, added 
new ones, changed the order slightly, and changed the citation style. The outlined 
approach identified 19 of the test documents, along with hundreds that contained at 
least some plagiarized sections. One very short document was not identified; it cited 
five sources, of which we deleted two. Figure 9 shows how the CbPD compares to the 
currently used text-based detection approaches. It also indicates that the performance 
is best if the text-based and the citation-based approach are combined.

Figure 9: Comparison of Detection Quality 
 
By lowering the threshold, not only can plagiarism be detected, but also documents 
which have not been cited, that were involved in the creation process. Figure 10 
shows an example. Document A was probably read by the author of Document B, but 
Doc A was not cited. This is not usually considered plagiarism, but knowledge 
concerning which papers were involved in the creation process can be of interest.

6   Conclusion 
This paper gave an overview of my PhD research project, which addresses the 
difficulty of measuring document relatedness in order to e.g. improve Academic 
Recommendation Systems and to identify plagiarism. Two approaches were presented 
and their advantages and disadvantages discussed. For more in-depth information 
please consult my publications.
