Introduction
1 Empowering the patient with language tech-
nology
This report forms the second deliverable of Work Package 27 of the EC
Network of Excellence 507505 Semantic Interoperabilty and Data Mining in
Biomedicine (Semantic Mining). The purpose of the work presented here
has been to develop well-founded and coherent arguments that language
technology can be put to good use in designing IT solutions with the aim
of empowering patients and other non-professionals who wish to access
medical information, e.g. health record contents, and also, more con-
cretely, to propose a research program with this goal.
We laid the groundwork in the first WP 27 deliverable (Åhlfeldt et al.
2006), a literature survey aspiring to present a picture of the state of the art
in patient-friendly information systems. In this second deliverable we re-
port on our own contrastive corpus-based investigations of the differences
between professional and non-professional medical language in several
languages (part II). The differences between language registers is well-
studied per se, but the multilingual aspect that our corpus studies now
bring to this field turns out to be fertile new ground which we have only
begun to explore.
On the basis of the earlier literature survey and the results of the corpus
studies, we then in part III go on to draw some tentative conclusions about
how “less patient-friendly documents” could be turned into more patient-
friendly ones using language technology, with a particular emphasis on
natural language generation (NLG) techniques.
Part II
Corpus study
2 Introduction
The corpus studies presented here represent a first attempt at characteriz-
ing in concrete terms the differences between (medical) professional and
lay language cross-linguistically. We review and correlate the findings
of three different studies of this topic, made by the present authors in
8 SEMANTIC MINING DELIVERABLE D27.2
various combinations (Hallett, Hardcastle & Willis 2006; Kokkinakis &
Toporowska Gronostaj 2006; Krivine et al. 2006; since the present paper
constitutes a summary and extension of the three previous works, we will
not as a rule refer to them explicitly in what follows). The investigated lan-
guages are English (based on the data in Hallett, Hardcastle & Willis 2006),
Japanese (Krivine et al. 2006), Russian (Krivine et al. 2006) and Swedish
(Kokkinakis & Toporowska Gronostaj 2006).
The studies are only partially overlapping in the textual and linguis-
tic phenomena investigated, hence the cross-linguistic generalizations will
concern a subset of the investigated characteristics. On the other hand, the
fact that we had three investigations of different languages made from
slightly different points of departure, has actually allowed us to reinter-
pret retrospectively some of the data in each of the individual studies in
the light of the other two.
Health care consumers are a heterogeneous group of individuals with
widely differing medical needs, backgrounds, levels of medical literacy
and ages. In recent years, they have been exposed to a rapid growth in
the amount of medical information available, e.g. general information on
health and medication issues, patients’ electronic health records written
by, and for health care providers, individual advisory information given
by net doctors for laypeople. The language of these texts covers a variety
of levels of difficulty, with e-health records and research-oriented texts at
one end and ask-the-doctor texts and web portals maintained by health
care consumers at the other. To make information accessible to health care
consumers, it has to be tailored to their individual needs. Thus the issue
of empowerment of health care consumers (e.g. patients) is in accordance
with the European Union’s data protection directive, in effect since 1998,
requiring that all member countries enact legislation enabling patients to
have access to their medical records.
In line with this recommendation, the issue of patient empowerment,
as well as the development and evaluation of generic methods and tools
for assisting patients to better understand their health and health care, has
been one of the many goals of the EU-funded “Semantic Mining” network.
One strand of this research is developing means for generating patient-
friendly, readable texts that paraphrase the content of the electronic health
records and other types of health-related information. There are several
ways to approach the task and our study focuses on examining linguistic
factors that involve contrastive characteristics of the medical sub-corpora,
in combination with the results provided by readability tests and other sta-
tistical means. Therefore, in our study it is assumed that effective lexical
guidance is a prerequisite for consumers’ access to medical information
in these texts. This pilot study, restricted to the subfield of cardiovas-
cular disorders, is an in-depth method study of vocabulary rather than
SEMANTIC MINING DELIVERABLE D27.2 9
a broad corpus examination. The work presented belongs to the area of
consumer health informatics which, according to Eysenbach (2000), is the
branch of medical informatics that analyses consumers’ needs for informa-
tion; it studies and implements methods of making information accessible
to consumers, and also models and integrates consumers’ preferences into
medical information systems.
The aim of the corpus analysis exercise was to provide us with basic
information on the lexical and syntactical features of medical texts, with a
view of producing medical reports easily understandable by patients.
The assessment of reading comprehension, on one hand, and the dis-
crepancy between reading abilities of patients and written patient infor-
mation, on the other, have been the focus of a number of studies in the
past. However, very few consumer-level vocabularies have been explored
so far, in spite of a growing need for the provision of open access to a
non-expert medical vocabulary; see, for instance, Tse & Soergel 2003. The
development of a lexical database, Medical WordNet, consisting of med-
ically relevant terms intended for non-experts, is discussed in Smith &
Fellbaum 2004. Such a database can be a valuable lexical resource for con-
sumer health information systems that need to comprehend both expert
and non- expert medical vocabulary and to map between the two. One
motivation for such work is the fact that medical terms, as used by profes-
sionals, are subject to control by continuously evolving standardization,
while the highly contextually dependent usage of medical terms on the
part of laypeople is much more difficult to capture in applications.1
Brown, Price & Cox (1997) acknowledge that a terminology designed to
support clinical records can only accurately account for the patient’s prob-
lems if the patient’s natural language is supported, since patients have a
need to understand and validate their records. Cantalejo & Lorda (2003)
analysed the readability of health education materials and proposed im-
provements, emphasizing the issue of cooperation: “Invite target readers
to help write and design the material”. Soergel, Tse & Slaughter (2004)
propose an interpretive layer framework for helping consumers “find, un-
derstand and use medical information when and where it is needed”. The
authors claim that this is something that can be accomplished by bridg-
ing mismatches in knowledge representation between the professional’s
perspective and the lay perspective and by filling in gaps in consumer
knowledge. Soergel, Tse & Slaughter (2004) also propose that such a sys-
tem needs a knowledge base for a consumer health ontology and relevant
context-based usage information. Hsieh, Hardardottir & Brennan (2004)
explore the level of the appropriateness of MetaMap (part of the Unified

technical terms used by health care professionals are linked to consumer health vocabu-
laries <http://www.consumerhealthvocab.org/>.

Medical Language System, UMLS) in capturing linguistic meaning of the
terms used by patients in free text. In 53% of the cases MetaMap captured
the linguistic meaning of the parsed terms used by the patients participat-
ing in the study, which is regarded by the authors as a very encouraging
figure that demonstrates the possibility of using natural language process-
ing (NLP) tools to automatically extract and capture the linguistic meaning
of the terms patients used in their e-mail messages. Finally, Ownby (2005)
investigated the influence of several aspects of the readability (e.g. use of
passive voice) of health care information from websites intended for the
elderly. His results show that easier-to-read sites could be differentiated
most consistently from more difficult ones by vocabulary complexity.
In more general terms, Kittredge (2003) discusses that sub-languages
can deviate from a standard language lexically, syntactically and seman-
tically. Among properties of a sublanguage being of relevance for the
NLP applications and in particular in the design of the descriptive gram-
mar, lexicon and the various stages of the processing algorithms, Kittredge
(2003: 437) names the following:
• restricted lexicon (and possibly including special words not used
elsewhere in the language);
• relatively small number of distinct lexical classes;
• restricted sentence syntax;
• deviant sentence syntax;
• restricted word co-occurrence patterns which reflect domain seman-
tics;
• restricted text grammar;
• different frequency of occurrence of words and syntax patterns from
the norm for the whole language – each sublanguage has its own
profile, which can be used to help set up preferred interpretations
for new texts.
3 Corpora and genres
3.1 Languages, corpora and texts
The languages investigated here are (British) English and Swedish in some
detail, and, more superficially, Japanese and Russian.
SEMANTIC MINING DELIVERABLE D27.2 11
3.1.1 English corpora
We have collected four small-size corpora (total word count approxi-
mately 280,000 words) containing texts in the domain of cancer, which
cover three communication procedures and four discourse genres. In the
Expert-Expert category we have two corpora: case studies written for
the benefit of students and clinicians (collected online)and extracts from
the Merck Manual for Medics (Beers & Berkow 2006). The Expert-Lay cor-
pus contains cancer-related texts from the Merck Manual for Patients (Beers
2006). The Lay-Lay corpus consists of online patient testimonials relating
their cancer experience (referred to as “stories” in the tables below). A de-
scription of the four corpora is presented in table 1. The online materials
contain texts about a variety of types of cancer. Although we have taken
reasonable care that no one type of cancer dominates the corpus, these
texts are not representative for the domain of cancer, nor are the various
cancer types equally represented. The Merck manuals are the closest to
each other in overall content, although even in their case some types of
cancer are over-represented in one manual as opposed to the other.

case studies Expert-Expert teaching/research 86908
Merck medics Expert-Expert manual 61032
Merck patients Expert-Lay manual 55154
stories Lay-Lay blog 78668
Table 1: English corpus description
Whilst some of the texts we have used come from internet sites that
encourage the distribution of their materials, others either have no spe-
cific copyright information available or require approval. In particular, the
Merck manuals are copyrighted materials which require written approval
from the copyright holder for any kind of personal, research or commer-
cial use.
Additionally, we performed a selection of files from the British Na-
tional Corpus (BNC) and split them into four categories according to a list
of keywords found in their header. The resulting subcorpora are:
• Expert-Expert: Academic seminars on cancer and also the GUT jour-
nal portion of the BNC, totalling 745k words over 3,395 documents.
• Expert-Lay: Pamphlets about cancer, AIDS and general healthcare
issues, totalling 150k words over 927 documents.
• Lay-Lay: A mixture of magazine, newsletter and journalist pieces
12 SEMANTIC MINING DELIVERABLE D27.2
about healthcare in quite general terms, totalling 130k words over 38
documents.
• GP Consultations: 119 GP consultations comprising 85k words from
the spoken-language part of the BNC. Because it is from the spoken
part it is very different from the other subcorpora, so for high level
analysis it is something of an outlier in many respects.
Since the BNC subcorpora are much more varied in terms of both do-
main and register, we intend to use the BNC material as a reference corpus
only, for testing our findings on the main corpus.
3.1.2 Swedish corpora
The lay versus professional sub-classification of medical texts is a very
rough, pragmatic, addressee-focused classification of corpora, which re-
quires a more fine-grained sub-categorization based on form and content.
As far as form is concerned, there is no doubt that specific sub- genres need
to be recognised and that this information is important for contrastive lin-
guistic studies of medical sub-languages. Reaching consensus among the
research community on relevant sub-genre categories is an important step
towards evolving standards for their encoding and in consequence for ac-
count of linguistic contrasts.
Within NLP there exist a number of approaches to automatic text
and genre classification, some more sophisticated than others. For in-
stance, Karlgren & Cutting (1994) apply statistical discriminant analysis;
Stamatatos, Kokkinakis & Fakotakis (2000) apply stylistically homoge-
neous categories such statistical measures of vocabulary richness using
frequency counts; while Hahn & Wermter (2004) apply n-gram character
statistics.
The MEDLEX Corpus comprises Swedish textual material assembled
from the internet, consisting of approximately 10 million words; for de-
tails, see Kokkinakis 2006. Out of this corpus, we selected two sub-corpora
(roughly 85,000 tokens each), using a predefined set of ten keywords rel-
evant to the cardiovascular disorders’ subdomain. Since the MEDLEX-
Corpus has been already annotated with meta-descriptors such as “<ti-
tle>” we decided for simplicity reasons to only search on the title descrip-
tor of each document in the corpus. The list of keywords consisted of the
following words and word fragments (including compounds containing
these words):
SEMANTIC MINING DELIVERABLE D27.2 13
fragmin ‘an anticoagulant’
heparin
hemostas ‘hemostasis’
hjärt(a) ‘heart’
koagulantia ‘coagulants’
propp ‘thrombus, thrombosis’
stenos ‘stenosis’
stroke
trombos ‘thrombus, thrombosis’
waran ‘an anticoagulant’
The only prerequisite has been that at least one of the keywords be
present in the main title heading of an article. In this way, we could ensure
that the two sampled sub-corpora were highly correlated with the cardio-
vascular sublanguage. The first sub-corpus, the non-expert corpus, de-
rives from a number of Swedish daily newspapers and other online health
information sources targeted to consumers (e.g. the Swedish NetDok-
tor). The second sub-corpus, the expert corpus, derives from two Swedish
medical resources intended for professionals and specialists across a broad
spectrum of medical professions: Läkartidningen, published weekly by the
Swedish Medical Association, and Dagens Medicin, a news site for medical
professionals.
To maximally maintain the inherent linguistic homogeneity of expert
and lay corpora, we decided not to include the texts from the ask-the-net-
doctor sites nor documents covering electronic patient records, because
these represent rather specific subgenres of medical texts as compared to
the main body of our medical corpora. They also represent divergent com-
municative settings which might have an effect on the account of linguis-
tic generalizations concerning the main core of investigated sub- corpora
with a clear educational profile. Thus our generalizations might be less to
the point, or not to be valid, for the mentioned subgenres, which deserve
a prior, separate study of their own corpora before the contrasts between
the potential sublanguages can be fully elucidated.
3.1.3 Japanese and Russian texts
The Japanese and Russian corpora were collected from the internet. They
consist of texts dealing with diabetes and nutrition, especially obesity in
connection with diabetes. The corpora were collected with the help of
keyword lists, a manual seed set of keywords to which were added terms
from UMLS (NLM 2005) and later further equivalent terms from the initial
set of retrieved documents.

The document sets were divided into scientific and lay/popularized
by native speakers of the languages using their intuition. Table 2 gives a
quantitative overview of the texts. For each language the total word count
is approximately 100,000 words of scientific texts and 200,000 words of
popularized texts.

4 Investigated variables
4.1 Readability
Readability is an objective, but rather crude, measure that estimates the
difficulty in reading text (without considering layout, familiarity of the
subject or subject complexity).
There are a number of readability indices available in the literature.
The Flesch Reading Ease test (FLESCH) scores documents according to the
following formula (higher scores indicate documents that are harder to
read):
206.835 − 1.015 × total words
total sentences
− 84.6 × total syllables
total words
The basic idea is that each group of contiguous non-blank characters
counts as a word and each vowel in a word counts as one syllable. To this
basic rule there are a number of sub-rules, e.g. words of ≤ 3 letters count as
one syllable. FLESCH estimates the reading comprehension level necessary
to understand a written document. For a given document, FLESCH is an
integer (0–100). Lower numbers indicate greater difficulty; scores of 0–30
are college graduate level, scores of 50–60 are high-school level and 90–100
should be readable for fourth-graders.
The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level score transforms the Flesch score into
years of education necessary to understand a text. The same meaning ap-
plies to the Fog-Gunning index (FOG).
SEMANTIC MINING DELIVERABLE D27.2 15
The LIX index is a popular readability index in Scandinavia developed
by Björnsson (1968). LIX is defined as Lm + Lo where Lm = W/N and
Lo = (LongWords/W ) × 100. Here LongWords are tokens longer than
6 characters. A higher LIX indicates greater difficulty: a LIX between 40
and 50 usually indicates newspaper language and 50–60 professional lan-
guage.

We computed the FOG, FLESCH and FLESCH-KINCAID indices, alongside
a number of other measures (detailed in table 3).

The FLESCH and FOG readability indices confirm the intuition that
Expert-Expert texts are more difficult to understand than both Expert-Lay

and Lay-Lay texts. The most difficult to read appear to be the texts in the
Merck-medics corpus (the FLESCH-KINCAID score indicates 16 years of ed-
ucation necessary to understand them), whilst the easiest are the patient
testimonials (can be understood by an average person with 9 years of ed-
ucation). This fact is supported by both the distribution of complex words
(i.e., words with more than 3 syllables) and the average number of words
per sentence. If we perform the same type of analysis on the BNC subcor-
pora we notice a similar trend in difficulty, with the Expert-Expert texts
being the most difficult to understand and the GP consults the easisest (ta-
ble 4). The only surprising result is the fact that Lay-Lay texts appear to be
more difficult to understand than the Expert-Lay ones.

Two readability tests were applied on the texts in order to determine the
difficulty level of the writing style, the FLESCH and LIX indices; see table 5.
In addition, a few simple metrics provide a description of the vocabulary
as well as a rough indication of lexical richness. Frequency bands were
also examined.
For a description of the vocabulary knowledge, we used the notions
of lexical originality, LO = no of unique tokens × 100/total no of tokens,
lexical density, LD = no of lexical tokens× 100/total no of tokens and lex-
ical sophistication, LS = no of advanced tokens× 100/no of lexical tokens.
LO measures the learner’s/reader’s performance relative to the group in
which the composition was written. LD is defined as the percentage of
lexical words (nouns, verbs, adjectives/participles and adverbs) in a text
and LS is the percentage of ‘advanced’ words in a text (here tokens not in-
cluded in the frequency bands 0–8; see further below); for a discussion of
the weaknesses of these metrics see Laufer & Nation 1995. Although LD
exhibits similar results in the two texts, the LO and LS figures were clearly
higher in the expert texts.

Word statistics Firstly, we constructed frequency lists for content words
and lemmas (content words were selected by using the Cornell list of stop
words) and calculated the percentage of word/lemma types in each of the
corpora (see appendix 1 for a list of the top 100 most frequent content
words in the four corpora). In order to assess the over- or under-usage of
the content words in one corpus compared to all the others we applied a
log-likelihood measure (see appendix 2 for the top 50 words with signifi-
cant differences for each of the 6 pairs of corpora).
We also computed the frequency of “outsiders” by performing a BNC
look-up and identifying words that do not appear in the BNC. This ex-
periment was intended to give us uncommon words, which would pre-
sumably have a highly technical content. However, since most of our
texts were written using American spelling, the results obtained were less
than reliable. A tf.idf-based ordering of the word types based on the BNC
proved equally unsatisfactory, since it returned in the top 20 words that
were mis-spelled and thus not present in the BNC.
MeSH terminology In order to assess the medical content of the corpora
we performed a series of experiments by identifying MeSH terms in the
corpora and computing a series of parameters:
• MeSH frequency and types count (see appendix 4 for the top 100
most frequent MeSH terms)
• log-likelihood values to compare the overuse of MeSH terms across
corpora (see appendix 5)
• Frequency of 1-, 2-, 3-, 4-, 5- and 6-gram MeSH terms
• distribution of MeSH terms in the 16 top-level MeSH categories
18 SEMANTIC MINING DELIVERABLE D27.2
As it can be seen in Figure 2, our experiments confirmed the intu-
ition that texts written by medical experts contain a significantly higher
number of medical terms than texts written by non-experts, as well as sig-
nificantly higher number of complex MeSH terms (i.e., consisting of 3 or
more words). However, we have found that an unexpectedly high num-
ber of MeSH terms are used in the texts written by medics for the benefit
of patients. At this point, we do not know if this is a characteristic of the
Merck manual alone (since this is our only source of Expert-Lay texts) or
if it reflects a common approach to producing texts for patients. Although
the patient testimonials contain an unexpectedly large number of MeSH
terms, it can be noticed that these are mainly one-word terms and the fre-
quency of terms drops sharply for terms longer than 2 words.
A closer look at the categories to which the MeSH terms belong shows
an uneven distribution of categories across corpora (Fig.3). Patient tes-
timonials contain a higher number of MeSH terms in the less technical
MeSH categories, such as Geographical location, Education, sociology and so-
cial phaenomena, Persons, Technology of food and beverages, Psychiatry and
Psychology. In the expert-written texts, a higher number of MeSH terms
come from the more technical Diseases and Chemicals and drugs categories.
This difference is increased even further if we look only at MeSH terms
longer than 2 words, with patient testimonials containing almost exclu-
sively medical terms in more common use.

4.2.2 Russian
Personal pronoun usage We expect to find more personal pronouns in
the popularized texts than in the scientific documents. In the case of the
Russian material, a relatively high frequency of occurrence of the first per-
son singular subject pronoun ja is a strong indicator that we are dealing
with a popularized text. In the Cyrillic alphabet, this is one letter (the last
letter in the alphabet), which means that there may be some cases of some
homonymy, mainly with the initial letter ‘Ja’ (or Ja.) as used in names. Still,
the difference is great: 7.12 occurrences per document in the popularized
subcorpus versus 0.29 occurrences in the scientific texts.
The second person singular subject pronoun ty is likewise an indica-
tor of popularized text, although less strong, with 0.92 against 0.37 occur-
rences, but noteworthy is that all 14 occurrences in the scientific subcorpus
are found in one document only.
The first person plural subject pronoun my again is more frequent in
the popularized subcorpus than in the scientific texts: 2.25 and 1.00 occur-
rences, respectively.
The second person plural subject pronoun is no different: 4.45 versus
2.55 occurrences.
In the case of the third person subject pronouns, there is no difference

between the two subcorpora.2

Quantitative data Finally, using frequency bands,3 we calculated the
percentage of word overlap (punctuation and names of persons, locations
and organizations were automatically identified and filtered out from the
texts) in the subcorpora with the 10,000 most frequent lemmas in the whole
MEDLEX-Corpus, a method similar to the lexical frequency profile for as-
sessing vocabulary knowledge, discussed in Laufer & Nation 1995. The
results (table 6) show that the outsiders, word types not in the 10,000 most
frequent lemmas, are almost twice as many in the expert texts as in the
non-expert texts, while group 0, the 1000 most frequent lemmas, corre-
sponds to as much as 73.35% of all lemmas in the expert and 80.24% in
the non-expert texts. The overlap of outsiders between expert/non-expert
texts is very low, only 225 types or ≈ 4% (see section 5 for a discussion).

Table 6: Frequency-band profiles for Swedish subcorpora
Using a number of different counts, the quantitative characteristics of
the selected textual material are summarized in table 7, showing that:
• there is a considerable difference in the number of types in the ex-
pert texts as compared to the non-expert ones, which indicates the
more scientific profile of the former. Therefore, the type/token ra-
tio (TTR) reflects the fact that the non-expert texts are composed of
2But these pronouns are not restricted to human or even animate referents, rather they
are used according to the grammatical gender of their antecedent (or referent), which
means that they are not “personal” in the literal sense of this word.
3The tool used for the frequency band analysis of the Swedish subcorpora was devel-
oped by M. Stissing (Århus komm. Sprogcenter).
SEMANTIC MINING DELIVERABLE D27.2 21
fewer word forms but are repeated more often (lexical variation). In
the non-expert texts, on average, any word form is repeated nearly
8.8 times, as opposed to 6.9 times in the expert texts. Since TTR is
a crude measure of lexical variation, which furthermore decreases
systematically, but nonlinearly, as the text length increases (i.e., the
sample mean – or average number of instances of each type – grows
larger with increasing text length; see, e.g. Baayen 2001), the stan-
dardized TTR (sTTR) has been proposed as a better alternative. sTTR
is computed every n words (here every 10,000 tokens) and a running
average is computed, which means that an average TTR is based on
consecutive 10,000-word chunks of text (cf. Lebart, Salem & Berry
1998). sTTR shows a similar picture to TTR, but with lower figures
overall;
• the average length of nouns is greater in the expert texts; longer
words are an indication of technical terminology (cf. Bodenreider
& Pakhomov 2003);
• there is a small difference in the number of compound forms: 12.1
(36.1% unique) in the expert texts compared to 10.4 (31.6% unique)
in non-expert ones. The high percentage in both cases can be ex-
plained by the fact that Swedish is a compounding language. The
most common compounds in the expert texts have been the terms:
hjärt∼svikt, hjärt∼infarkt, hjärt-∼kärl∼sjukdom, while the most com-
mon compound terms in the non-expert texts have been: blod∼propp,
hjärt∼infarkt, hjärt∼svikt;
• the token/sentence ratio (TSR) is higher in expert texts (18.7 com-
pared to 14.8 for non-expert texts). The TSR value for sentences that
include at least one verb, TSRverb, increases 1.7 points to 20.4 for
expert and 1.3 points to 16.1 for non-expert texts;
• there is a significant difference in the number of “pure” acronyms,
such as NSAID, ASA and PCI and also acronyms in compound
forms, such as TNF-alfa, WPW-syndrom and BNP-test with a predom-
inance in the expert texts, indicating a clear overuse in these texts;
• the most important differences between the part-of-speech classes
are observed for main verbs, auxiliary verbs and personal pronouns.
In non- expert texts, there are 12.7% main verbs compared to 10%
in expert texts, and 2.9% auxiliaries compared to 1%; 4.3% personal
pronouns in non-experts compared to 2.1% in expert text.

departure is lexical, which means that morphological, morpho-syntactic
and semantic properties of the vocabulary in the texts are brought into
focus. Special attention is paid to a subset of lexical properties which cap-
tures the types of linguistic contrasts of relevance for the analysis, e.g. dis-
tribution of parts of speech, compositionality of word forms, form famil-
iarity and also the manifested semantic relations between words. In this
study we also take advantage of information on the distribution of words
on frequency bands. Linguistic contrasts are manifested most clearly at
the extreme ends of the frequency bands, namely by words listed within
the groups 0 and so-called outsiders. Group 0 is a local, common core vo-
cabulary representative of the expert and non-expert texts examined here.
Its vocabulary shares the following characteristics:
• all parts of speech are represented in this group, including a few very
common abbreviations, such as: ca, m. and mg;
• the majority of words are simplex;
• occurrences of compounds (e.g. hjärt-kärlsjukdom ‘cardiovascular
disease’) are exceptional;
SEMANTIC MINING DELIVERABLE D27.2 23
• native vocabulary dominates; loan words from Latin and Greek are
very few (e.g. antibiotikum ‘antibiotic’);
• general vocabulary dominates, but it has a touch of medical profile
due to the sub-domain selected; hence a certain prevalence of words
referring to anatomy, diseases, symptoms and treatment, as well as
to the medical staff and organization of health care.
In the subsequent groups, 1 to 8, we observed that:
• in both the expert and non-expert texts, only a subset of parts of
speech is represented, since most of the so-called stop words (e.g.
conjunctions) belong to the core vocabulary;
• the number of compounds grows rapidly in both expert and non-
expert texts, but the increase of unique compound forms is more
pronounced in the expert texts;
• occurrence of medical terms in the expert texts is higher; for instance,
within group 8 of the expert texts the number of medical terms is
about twice as large as for to the corresponding group of the non-
expert texts;
• Latin and Greek loan words are more frequent in the expert texts;
• the prevalence of nominalizations, a characteristic of scientific texts
(Nordman 1992), is reaffirmed in our study. There are five times
more nouns than verbs in group 8 of the expert texts. The corre-
sponding factor for the non-expert text is four;
• the number of medically relevant abbreviations and acronyms in-
creases across groups 1 to 8. The total number of self-contained
acronyms is four times larger in the expert texts than the non-expert
texts. Abbreviations usually refer to dosage of drugs, types of medi-
cal examinations and their measures, specification of anatomic loca-
tions, etc.
The tendencies described for groups 1 to 8 are also valid for the group
of outsiders. However, the differences become more evident as medical
terminology is gaining ground. The group of outsiders is also more hetero-
geneous in its internal composition because it also includes new elements,
namely occurrences of foreign words, particularly English ones. Thus, an
array of word forms that need to be handled when processing medical text
and designing lexical guidance include:
24 SEMANTIC MINING DELIVERABLE D27.2
• unique or less frequent acronyms and abbreviations in the expert
texts like: ESCS, TMR, vf, vka, bitr;
• medical compounds words with or without acronyms: ICD-grupp,
fotopletysmograf;
• medical simplex words: tromb, torsion;
• text unique or less frequent medical non-compound words: ögon,
oxytocin;
• foreign words: grown-up, serious;
• misspellings (medical and general language)
• general language compounds
• general language simplex words
MeSH terminology The analysis discussed so far was extended by the
use of a Swedish MeSH (Medical Subject Headings)4 annotator on the
texts, in order to find out the distribution of the number of medical terms
in the two corpora. In this way, we were also able to account for text
characteristics that extend beyond simple surface counts (e.g. tokens and
types) and thus complement the quantitative analyses with more quali-
tative data. Assessing term difficulty is clearly a shortcoming of apply-
ing general readability measures (section 4.1.2) to health-related content.
It has been argued that simple techniques, such as counting the num-
ber of syllables in words or appearance on frequency lists, often do not
apply to health-related contexts, which typically contain a large number
of technical terms (cf. Zeng et al. 2005). Our findings revealed that in
the expert texts, there were 4,620 complete MeSH matches (e.g. “<mesh
tag="A07.231.114">artär</mesh>”, i.e. artery) and 409 partial MeSH an-
notations (e.g. “sub<mesh tag="A08.186.566.166">araknoid</mesh>”,
i.e. sub-arachnoid), while in the non-expert texts there were 6,144 com-
plete MeSH matches and 277 partial ones. The non-unique figures for
complete match clearly show that in non-expert texts there is more use
of terminology; however, the figures based on unique occurrences indi-
cate a higher number of different terms in the expert texts, which means
that in non-expert texts there is a clear indication of repetitive use of the
terms, while in the expert texts there is a richer use of terminology. In
4MeSH is the controlled vocabulary thesaurus of the U.S. National Library of Medicine
(NLM). The original data from NLM have been supplemented with Swedish translations

order to see whether the distribution of these figures is significant, we ap-
plied the χ2 statistic as guidance, calculated on the six most important
hierarchies of MeSH, namely: A (Anatomy), B (Organisms), C (Diseases),
D (Chemicals and Drugs), E (Analytical, Diagnostic and Therapeutic Tech-
niques and Equipment), and F (Psychiatry and Psychology). χ2 measures
the similarity of one sub-corpus to another with respect to frequencies of
individual words or other linguistic features. The figures in parentheses
(table 8) indicate the occurrences of terms in the six hierarchies for the two
types of text. The returned χ2 figures (degree of freedom=5) indicate in all
four cases that the difference is significant.

Lexico-semantic parameters The meanings of medical word forms can
be studied with respect to semantic relations like synonymy, antonymy,
hyperonymy, hyponymy and meronymy. Here, we argue that explicit in-
formation on these relations can not only support the contrastive analysis
of the medical sub-corpora but can also offer significant help for laypeople
in understanding medical language, if the information is made accessible
to them via an online dictionary (cf. Smith & Fellbaum 2004). To illus-
trate the issue, we take a closer look at the six most frequent keywords’
related terms in these sub-corpora and reflect on the correlations between
meanings, semantic relations and their frequencies (table 9).
It is of importance to note that these two lists share four out of the
six words, which means that both of them capture the most central terms
in the cardiovascular domain. The partially different ranking of these
four words can be explained partly by differences in the textual material,
partly by different preferences of laypeople and professionals for describ-
ing health conditions. Laypeople tend to focus on symptoms and profes-
sionals on diagnoses; hence the difference in the ranking of hjärta.

‘cardiovascular disease’ (short for blodpropp)
62 hjärtstopp ‘cardiac arrest’ 147 hjärtsvikt ‘cardiac insufficiency’
Table 9: Most frequent keywords’ related terms in Swedish subcorpora
Diagnostic terms like stroke and hjärtinfarkt ‘heart attack’ are ordered
according to the same ranking sequence on both lists. For laypeople to
have a minimal understanding of such terms, some knowledge about their
place in the medical ontology, in other words knowledge of their hyper-
onym is required. Their hyperonym, hjärt-kärlsjukdom ‘cardiovascular dis-
ease’ happens to occupy the fifth position on the expert keylists and the
eleventh on the non-expert keylist, which means that the term can be con-
sidered familiar even to laypeople. High ranked on the non-expert list,
the polysemous word blodpropp and its short form propp belong to two
different conceptual categories, “organic object” vs. “cardiovascular dis-
ease”. The former gets a concrete reading, ‘a blood clot’, and the latter an
abstract one, referring to ‘health condition caused by a blood clot, throm-
bus’. Since the abstract reading hints at the concrete reading, the key to
correct disambiguation often lies in the word’s lexical and/or syntactic
context. Unfortunately, it is often the case that general dictionaries ex-
plain only the word’s concrete meaning, leaving a layperson in the lurch.
More exhaustive information can be obtained from MeSH, even if its def-
inition explicates only the concrete reading of blodpropp ‘thrombus’. The
meaning referring to the health condition thrombosis can be obtained from
the MeSH hierarchy, in which the node blodproppssjukdom (thromboem-
bolism) is a hyponym of blodpropp (thrombosis) whose top hyperonym
is the node hjärt-kärlsjukdomar (cardiovascular diseases); see figure 4. Thus
the second, disease reading is mediated in MeSH via the thesaurus struc-
ture. The ambiguity factor of the word blodpropp can possibly serve as an
explanation why its frequency is low in the expert texts (40 occurrences)
and, in tandem, why it ranks as the second word on the non-expert list
(347 occurrences). This observation confirms those of Brown, Price & Cox
(1997). Clinical terms are by necessity complex and not easily amenable
to being represented in patient language without a full definition; a hier-
archical placement of terms has proved beneficial in orienting a patient in
the meaning of the term. This strategy can contribute to the fact that non-
SEMANTIC MINING DELIVERABLE D27.2 27
professional language has greater variability in meaning, which results in
choosing a superordinate, more general term, instead of a subordinate one.
Figure 4: Part of the MeSH hierarchy (from <http://mesh.kib.ki.se/>)
Listing of synonyms with comments on their register is another step
that might not only be layperson friendly but could also contribute to
bridging the communication gap between laypeople and professionals.
Since the task of manual extraction of semantic information from cor-
pora is both time- and cost-consuming, further elaboration of seman-
tic acquisition approaches needs to be investigated (cf. Kokkinakis,
Toporowska Gronostaj & Warmenius 2000).

to the ones described in section 4.2.1 were performed on the parsed texts

of the various subcategories of part-of-speech can be found in appendix
3).
Again, this analysis did not return any surprise findings. The larger
proportion of personal pronouns and past tense verbs in the patient testi-
monials is an indication of the more personal nature of the discourse and
of the fact that they relate past histories, and provides no useful informa-
tion about the style of discourse which we can extrapolate on in generating
patient reports.

Phrase and clause statistics Not only frequency analysis of vocabulary
but also measures related to syntactic annotation, manual or automatic,
can be a criterion for differentiation of scientific from general texts and
style in general (cf. Biber 1995). High occurrences of noun phrases as well
as use of infinitival and passive constructions are considered to be repre-
sentative of scientific texts (Sager, Dungworth & McDonald 1980). Syn-
tactic analysis focused on sentence length and structure brings out fur-
ther parameters which can support the contrastive analysis of the texts.

domains, which do not include medical language, are given in Nordman
1992.
To our knowledge, the syntactic properties of Swedish medical lan-
guage have not been examined previously. Therefore, we applied a
Swedish parser to the part- of-speech annotated version of the corpus; for
a description of the parser, see Kokkinakis & Johansson Kokkinakis 1999.
Table 13 summarizes the findings regarding the syntactic analysis.6 The
number of “medical” noun phrases, i.e., where the head is a medical term,
the active main clauses and all types of subordinate clauses is higher in
the non-expert texts. The difference between the passive constructions is
small. Extensive lists, of for instance symptoms and drugs, in the expert

phrases, which do not contain prepositions, relative pronouns or conjunctions (unless
the NP or part of it has been analyzed as a named entity in the named entity recogni-
tion step which precedes the syntactic parsing proper, in which case the NP may contain
prepositions, etc.).

texts, might be an explanation of these results: i.e., a relatively smaller
number of clauses, a high number of noun and prepositional phrases. An
interesting feature of the explanative profile of the lay corpus is the use of
the syntactic bigram om man ‘if one’, consisting of a conditional subjunc-
tion, followed by an indefinite pronoun which functions as a subject of a
subordinate clause. The use of this bigram is ten times more frequent in
the lay corpora (240 occurrences), as compared to the professional texts
(21 occurrences), which is a relevant contrastive property of the two sub-
corpora.
This particular syntactic construction is also semantically interesting.
The chameleon-like referential meaning of the indefinite pronoun varies
with the type of the corpus. In the texts written by medical experts, it usu-
ally carries reference to medical professionals (in 19 out of the 21 uses),
while in the lay corpora it refers mostly to health care consumers. This ob-
servation has, in turn, further consequences for the choice of co-occurring
semantic types of the predicates and their semantic restrictions. In case
of reference to professionals, the predicates often turn to be agentive verbs
performing some medical actions, in contrast to laypeople that are stricken
with illness or seen as potential patients (also in the grammatical sense).
The high frequency of the suppositive structures in the lay sub-corpora
contributes to their readability, which is no doubt appreciated by laypeo-
ple.

4.4 Semantics and pragmatics
4.4.1 Japanese
Politeness In Japanese, the politeness value of certain linguistic items
can be used to as a criterion for distinguishing the two text categories.
Politeness values are expressed on the predicate (verb, adjective or noun)
standing at the end of the sentence. Distinguishing two politeness levels,
polite and neutral, we find marked differences in their use:
The polite style is much more frequent in the popularized texts (found
in 32.52 sentences per document on average) than in the scientific subcor-
pus (an average of 13.62 sentences per document), whereas the reverse
holds for the neutral style (23.46 and 1.98 sentences per document on av-
erage).
4.4.2 Russian
Conditional mood We would expect that uncertainty would be marked
more often in the popularized subcorpus. In Russian, the invariable parti-
cle by – marker of the conditional mood – is a common way of expressing
uncertainty, hence its frequency of occurrence should correlate well with
the occurrence of uncertainty in the discourse. In particular, many occur-
rences of by will be in conditional clauses (where it occurs together with
the conditional subjunction esli). Cf. the discussion earlier (in section 4.3.2)
about Swedish conditional clauses as a discriminating feature for nonpro-
fessional texts.
The particle by turns out to be a very good discriminating feature for
the distinction between scientific and popularized texts, with an average
of 0.74 occurrences per document in the former and 1.44 in the popularized
subcorpus of Russian.
4.4.3 Swedish
Adjective use In the context of biomedicine, adjectival modification has
been studied both for the identification of hierarchical relations among
biomedical terms and also in applications such as automatic construction
of terminologies and ontologies (cf. Bodenreider & Pakhomov 2003). For
the contrastive characteristics of adjectival modification (including partici-
ples) across the two corpora, we made a comparison using the frequency
of occurrence of each string found in either of the two corpora and the like-
lihood ratio test (which is also known as the G-statistic; Dunning 1993).
All adjectives and participles were extracted from the two corpora, lem-
matised and compared. There are more adjective/participle tokens and
32 SEMANTIC MINING DELIVERABLE D27.2
types in expert texts (8,371 tokens, 2,892 types, 1,669 lemmas) than in non-
expert texts (6,778 tokens and 1,786 types, 1,182 lemmas). Table 14 shows
the adjectives with the highest log-likelihood values.

Table 14: Adjectives most characteristic of each text type in Swedish sub-
corpora
The higher the log-likelihood figure is in expert texts the greater the
deviation from the non-expert texts and vice versa. The respective lists
are also semantically heterogeneous; the adjectives in the expert texts are
medically significant in contrast to those in the non-expert texts, which are
generally descriptive. The lack of overlap between the two lists indicates
different collocational preferences. Enhancement of lexical resources with
such information seems to be supportive for the users.
4.5 Other variables
4.5.1 Japanese and Russian: Document layout and typography
Images In documents collected from the internet, particularly web pages
(HTML documents), the use of images could provide a clue as to the genre
SEMANTIC MINING DELIVERABLE D27.2 33
of the documents. Images are easy to find, as they are normally introduced
by the HTML element <img>.
The number of images turns out to be discriminating in Russian – with
a mean of 44.0 images per document in the popularized subcorpus against
15.5 in the scientific texts – whereas the situation in Japanese is that both
text types display exactly the same figure, 21.54 images per document on
the average.
Simple counting of images is easy but unfortunately does not tell us
anything about the types of image used and their function.
Tables Tables should appear more often in scientific prose than in pop-
ularized texts. Again, there are a couple of HTML elements that can be
counted directly and mechanically, i.e., <table> and possibly <caption>.
Unfortunately, the table facility of HTML is often used by webpage au-
thors purely for purposes of layout, e.g. as an alternative to frames or
lists.
In any case, there turns out to be a difference between the two text
types in Russian with respect to this criterion. However, it goes against
expectations: There are more tables (HTML <table> elements) in the pop-
ularized texts (13 per document on average) than in the scientific texts (8.5
per document). This could reflect the fact that the information in the pop-
ularized texts is more “digested”, turned into a more palatable format for
the average citizen, whereas the scientific texts are “cruder” and for this
reason as well demand more from their reader.
Lists In the case of Russian, the HTML list elements <ul> and <ol> serve
as good indicators of the genre of the text. Lists are used more often in the
scientific subcorpus – with 1.55 occurrences of <ol> and 2.26 occurrences
of <ul> on the average per document – than in the popularized texts, with
only 0.40 occurrences of <ol> and 0.50 occurrences of <ul> per document.
Typographical marking of emphasis Emphasis can be marked in HTML
documents by the use of the elements <i> (italics), <b> (bold) and <strong>
(strong emphasis, normally displayed as bold). There are differences in
how frequently text emphasis is used between the two text types, but they
point in different directions in Russian and Japanese.
In Russian, the emphasis markers are used more in scientific texts (<i>
appears 13.18 times and <b> 30.97 times per document on average) than
in the popularized subcorpus (2.61 <i> and 8.01 <b>).
In Japanese, <b> and <strong> appear together 13.05 times per docu-
ment on average in the popularized texts, as against 8.87 in the scientific
34 SEMANTIC MINING DELIVERABLE D27.2
subcorpus. The <i> element is too little used overall in the Japanese mate-
rial for any conclusions.
Punctuation Punctuation can reflect the complexity of the text in terms
of how complex its sentences are (comma, semicolon, colon, parentheses,
etc.), but also convey information about emotivity (question and exclama-
tion marks), and finally show references to other sources of information
(quotation marks).
In the Russian corpora, emotion-conveying punctuation seems to be
underused in the scientific subcorpus compared to the popularized texts.
In the scientific subcorpus there were 4.0 question marks and 1.76 excla-
mation marks per document, whereas the corresponding figures for the
popularized texts were 6.25 question marks and 5.63 exclamation marks.
Unexpectedly, quotation marks are used much more often in the popu-
larized subcorpus in Russian than in the scientific texts: 17.32 occurrences
per document in the former and only 3.76 in the scientific subcorpus. Still,
this seems to be a strong distinguishing characteristic for the two sub-
corpora. Apparently most instances of quotation marks in both subcor-
pora are not quotations in the narrower sense, but the quotation marks are
rather employed as a general distancing mechanism (meaning, roughly:
“Someone else is responsible for (the formulation of) this word/phrase”),
in the scientific texts for referring to laymen’s terms
5 Per-language conclusions
5.1 English
The quantitative analysis of the corpus produced few surprise findings.
The distribution of morphological and syntactical constructions is indica-
tive of the general nature of discourse (technical vs non-technical), and
does not present any obvious additional features that could separate the
medical domain from any other technical domain. The lexical analysis
shows insignificant differences in lexical variety between subcorpora, al-
though with a slight increase in the percentage of lexical types in texts
written by experts for experts. Interesting results were found in the analy-
sis of MeSH terms, with the highest distribution found in the texts written
by experts for patients. On closer look, we have found that this higher
frequency is not due to the more technical nature of Expert-Lay texts, but
to the fact that medical concepts are often accompanied by explanations of
terms using other (sometimes more technical) medical concepts, or simply
by synonyms (as in alternative trade names for drugs). Further analysis
of MeSH terms found that the medical terms in patient testimonials are of
SEMANTIC MINING DELIVERABLE D27.2 35
a less technical nature than in texts written by experts, and this becomes
especially obvious when looking at longer MeSH terms (2 or more words).
5.2 Japanese and Russian
Since Japanese and Russian were investigated contrastively in the original
article, we here note such findings that are common to the two languages,
while those traits that are characteristic of one of the languages only, are
discussed below, as we discuss which crosslinguistic generalizations can
be made on the basis of the corpus study (section 6).
For Japanese and Russian, mostly other variables were investigated
than in the case of the other two languages of this corpus study. It seems,
however, that Russian sides with English and Swedish in using less per-
sonal pronouns in lay text than in professional text. Arguably, pronoun us-
age differences in these three languages serve the same purpose as the dif-
ferent frequencies of polite and neutral forms in the Japanese texts, where
polite forms are a characteristic of the lay register and neutral forms pre-
dominate in the professional texts.
There are common differences in the use of some (HTML) typographi-
cal elements, supporting the notion that the professional texts are more of
an “information conduit” (mainly one-way) than a communication chan-
nel (for interaction).
5.3 Swedish
The binary division of the examined medical corpora alludes to the poten-
tial target groups represented by health care workers and laypeople. The
two target groups have partly a common pragmatic purpose, namely com-
munication, which needs to be based on maximum mutual understanding
to ensure the best care, partly a separate one, i.e., communication within
their own groups, focused on sharing medical knowledge.
From our frequency based and lexical analysis of the vocabulary it is
also clear that the stock of medical terms in the non-expert texts grows. Ac-
cording to Grabarczyk (1987: 185), “the vocabulary expansion leads to a
greater differentiation of conceptual categories and to a more precise ‘artic-
ulation of reality’ and therefore to the perfection of inter-human commu-
nication”. The relevance of Grabarczyk’s (1987) observation for the issue
of patient empowerment is obvious. The dynamic vision of vocabulary
expansion entails also an increase in medical literacy, but at the same time
it contributes to segregation of health consumers with respect to their initi-
ation in the medical knowledge. To compensate for this knowledge segre-
gation, lexical resources need to integrate lexical and medical knowledge
36 SEMANTIC MINING DELIVERABLE D27.2
in a user friendly and flexible way to suit the actual needs of particular
users.
The number and the diversity of the types of lexical data gathered by
the contrastive analysis of the corpora are also of pragmatic importance
for the construction of an open-source, multidimensional, on-line lexical
resource providing selective and dynamic lexical assistance for health care
consumers. The information included there on words’ morphological,
syntactic and semantic behaviour should be integrated with some basic
and/or advanced encyclopaedic medical information and information on
English equivalents to support information extraction from other lexical
and textual sources. The fusion of all information is a key issue for the
empowerment of health care consumers as well as for the refinement a
number of NLP applications (e.g. generation and health information re-
trieval and understanding; Zeng & Tse 2006).
In this study, we have compared the language in two types of register,
i.e., expert and non-expert Swedish texts in the domain of cardiovascular
disorders. The main question that arises from this work is: what are the
practical benefits, if any, brought about by this study? We believe that
our work provides some guidance for those interested in improving the
readability of health-related information material. It attempts to integrate
a language-independent approach (statistics and frequency criteria) with
a language-dependent approach (vocabulary and its linguistic properties).
We hope that our work will provide some insights and relevant pragmatic
implications on how to bridge the language barrier between health care
consumers and professionals.
We are fully aware that this vocabulary study is just a beginning and is
to be complemented by an extensive analysis of deeper syntactic relations
on sentence level as well as phrase level. An in-depth study of the co-
ordinated and subordinated structures in different sentences/clauses will
be the issues for future work. As Bodenreider & Pakhomov (2003) note,
adjectives may be useful to characterize corpora into genres, and thus, ad-
jectival modification can be exploited in applications such information re-
trieval of biomedical documents. Another relevant research topic is the
extraction of the types of syntactic or/and semantic patterns characteris-
tic of the non-professional corpora in order to re-formulate the content of
expert documents in a user-friendly way. Such patterns can also generate
new information for enriching the lexical resource with semantic relations.
In the near future, we also intend to investigate how readability measures
are related to how consumers use and benefit from material on health care
information websites.

6 Cross-linguistic generalizations
Looking at the individual studies, we are struck by some results that they
have in common. By and large, generally held assumptions about the
differences between more formal (professional) and more informal (lay)
written registers are confirmed by these studies. Hence, in this respect,
at least, they present no real surprises. Their value lies, firstly, in their
cross-linguistic focus and, secondly, in the hard data they present in sup-
port of these assumptions, and in the directions they give us for moving
into hitherto uncharted territory, e.g. more thorough and rigorous inves-
tigations of the syntax of the two kinds of text, particularly with a view
to propose syntactical transformations that are within the reach of today’s
language technology.
One intriguing piece of information that emerges from this comparison
of the English and Swedish corpus investigations is that for the English
“X-Lay” subcorpora, the character of “X” seems to matter. On a number
of variables, the Expert-Lay subcorpus (Merck patients) patterns with the
two English Expert-Expert subcorpora (case studies and Merck medics)
– and with the Swedish expert subcorpus – rather than with the English
Lay-Lay subcorpus (patient testimonials – “stories”) and the Swedish non-
expert subcorpus, or in some cases in-between the two extremes. This
seems to be true at least for the following variables:
• percentage of complex words
• medical (MeSH) term distribution
• word length
• sentence length
• percentage of common nouns
• percentage of verbs
• percentage of personal pronouns (also Russian)
• noun phrase length
This could mean that the simple dichotomy expert – non-expert is actu-
ally too crude, as discussed briefly in section 3.1.2, and should be replaced
by a more many-faceted notion of the kinds of texts involved (see also be-
low). It could also mean, however, that the authors of the Merck patients
material have failed to tune their text to the envisaged readership. Only
further research can clarify this matter.
38 SEMANTIC MINING DELIVERABLE D27.2
6.1 Readability
Readability varies as predicted in the English and Swedish studies, with
professional language being more demanding on the reader than lay lan-
guage.
Readability is an indirect measure of complexity of vocabulary and
syntax. Indirect, because length (in words and sentences) can be assumed
to correlate with complexity, but of course we cannot make texts easier
to read simply by mechanically shortening words and sentences, e.g. by
inserting spaces in the middle of words and sentence punctuation in the
middle of sentences. Readability measures are a symptom of some under-
lying linguistic factor(s), much in the same way that temperature as dis-
played by a thermometer is a symptom; we cannot make our environment
warmer or colder by manipulating the thermometer.
In the context of this work, however, the role of readability could be to
give us a first quick and dirty indication that something needs to be done
with a text in order to make it palatable to a particular group of intended
readers. E.g., even if we cannot of course physically shorten the words in
a text, we might well consider replacing some words with shorter (near)
synonyms. Similarly, on the syntactic level, complex sentences could be
transformed into sequences of main clauses.
6.2 Special terminology
Generally, special terms are more frequent in professional texts, i.e., med-
ical terms as found using MeSH. Nonprofessional texts also contain such
terms, but in this case the terms are more likely to be:
(a) more general in the sense that they coincide with words in general
language (e.g. for body parts);
(b) less specialized in some other way, e.g., they designate a larger
anatomical structure or a class of ailments rather than an anatomi-
cal detail or a specific disease;
(c) not really medical in the narrower sense, i.e., they belong to such
subsections of MeSH as, e.g., Geographical location.
6.3 An inordinate fondness for nouns?
The professional texts in this study generally conform to the oft-noted ten-
dency of using more nouns than everyday (written) language, and, cor-
respondingly, of using less verbs. Medical terminology – like specialized
SEMANTIC MINING DELIVERABLE D27.2 39
terminologies generally, at least in the languages that we have been in-
vestigating – are “noun-heavy”; the majority of the terms are nouns (or
the corresponding relational adjectives) or noun phrases. Verbs tend to
be semantically empty. On the other hand, this is also a characteristic of
formal or bureaucratic language in general, so it is not immediately obvi-
ous whether it is the medical character of the texts which is responsible for
the preponderance of nouns, or simply their formal nature. This has some
implications for how the language of the texts could be made more accessi-
ble to non-specialists. In the case of general formal-bureaucratic language,
there are normally ways of reducing the share of nouns (generally nom-
inalizations) of the texts, by introducing constructions with semantically
non-empty verbs instead.
6.4 Grammar matters
From the corpus studies, we get both direct and indirect information about
grammar – morphology, morphosyntax and syntax – in the investigated
language varieties/registers. This is an area where we have only begun to
scratch the surface, however, and we expect to return to the issue of how
grammatical differences reflect differences in register, or put in another
way, differences in authorship and (perceived) readership of texts.
Here are some grammatical differences that we have found in our cor-
pus study:
• Sentences are generally longer in professional language than in the
lay variety. This statistic was explicitly calculated for the Swedish
corpora, and is indirectly available for the English material, since
one parameter in the calculation of readability indices (Flesch, Lix) is
normally sentence length (in words). Pending a more detailed syn-
tactic analysis, we cannot know if this is due to a greater syntactic
complexity on the sentence level (more subordination) or simply be-
cause NPs tend to be longer in professional texts (see the next item).
We suspect that both factors are present, however.
• Noun phrases tend to be longer in professional texts. This is cer-
tainly connected with the general facts that special terminology is
made almost exclusively of nouns (see section 6.2), and that profes-
sional (and formal, bureaucratic) language favors nouns in general
to a greater degree than everyday language.
6.5 Pragmatic features
There seem to be some pragmatic features which distinguish the two main
kinds of registers investigated, professional and lay texts. The evidence
40 SEMANTIC MINING DELIVERABLE D27.2
for this is mainly indirect, as with some of the grammatical features (sec-
tion 6.4).
The higher frequency of personal pronouns in the lay texts point to a
more personal style in this register. In the case of Japanese, this is also in-
dicated by the different politeness markers found in the two registers. Lay
texts also favor past tense verbs, indicating a narrative style: an unfolding
of events, rather than a statement of timeless facts.
The usage of punctuation marks in Russian supports the notion that
the lay texts are less formal, more “intimate” than the professional texts.
Finally, the conditional mood – expressing (among other things) un-
certainty – seems to be a characteristic of lay texts rather than professional
texts. How this is to be interpreted remains to be investigated in more
detail.
7 Future work
The picture presented here of documents on medical matters falling into
one of two categories is of course a grossly oversimplified one. On the one
hand, the ‘lay’ population is quite diversified in its background knowl-
edge, educational level, etc. On the other, ‘healthcare professionals’ also
make up a heterogeneous body of individuals with different educational
backgrounds and differing communicative needs. What we are dealing
with is a spectrum of texts and a number of communication needs, be-
tween doctors and laymen (the case considered here), but also between
the various professions within the healthcare system. This means that we
need to conduct further investigations of the differential linguistic char-
acteristics of the various communicative settings involved. However, we
are even now in a position to formulate some tentative requirements on
patient-friendly documentation systems, and to advance some recommen-
dations for the creation of such systems.
SEMANTIC MINING DELIVERABLE D27.2 41
Part III
Using language technology for
the creation of patient-friendly
documents
8 Introduction
The generation of patient-friendly documents will become necessary be-
cause of new laws in several European countries. For instance:
• Law on public health no 2002-303 adopted on 4 March 2002 in
France;
• Social Services Act in Sweden, Data Protection Act 1998;
• Access to Health Records Act 1990 and Data Protection Act 1998 in
UK.
According to these laws and acts, hospitals and medical institutions must
be able to provide patients with their clinical documents and, moreover,
these documents should be understandable for patients. As many re-
searchers have observed that there are a number of differences between
expert and non-expert language, the aim of this report is to propose some
recommendations in order to overcome some of these differences and to
create patient-friendly documents.
The recommendations can address different kinds of criteria accord-
ing to the areas concerned. For instance, for computer science they would
concern interfaces, data structures and algorithms; for language technol-
ogy they would describe the choices made when non-linguistic content is
transformed into language (words and terms used, syntactic structures,
document layout, etc) or when linguistic content is modified to better suit
a particular category of reader or listener; for the psychologic area they
would specify the ergonomic characteristics of the interface, etc. The pur-
pose of this report is to specify the recommendations as they can be stated
from the point of view of language technology in order to be used by a
natural language generation system.
In the following, we first define the purpose of creating patient-friendly
documents (section 9). The bulk of this part of the report is devoted to the
description of recommendations (section 10). We then describe the context
in which such documents will be generated, i.e., the Natural Language
42 SEMANTIC MINING DELIVERABLE D27.2
Generation demonstrator (section 11) and general principles of the eval-

9 Purpose of patient-friendly documents
The task of generating patient-friendly documents can be thought of as
fulfilling at least translational (section 9.1) or educational (section 9.2) pur-
poses. Note that these are not mutuallyexclusive, and possibly not exhaus-
tive either.
9.1 Translational purpose
From the translational point of view, the generation of patient-friendly
documents is conceived as a translational problem. In this case, expert jar-
gon, and especially the terms used, are translated into patient language.
Thus, the main resources needed are two-fold lexicons and terminologies
which link controlled terminologies, such as MeSH, Snomed or ICD, to
patient vocabularies.
If a more detailed comparison between expert and non-expert docu-
ments is performed, it appears that at other linguistic levels (morphol-
ogy, syntax, etc) more differences can be observed. Thus, the translation
can also be performed at these additional levels. In this case, the system
should aim at transforming the morphological, grammatical, syntactic etc.
structures as well. Translation at these additional levels requires addi-
tional resources and databases.
In section 10, the recommendations devoted to the translational pur-
pose are marked (t).
9.2 Educational purpose
The educational purpose of generation of patient-friendly documents goes
beyond “simple” translation. The aim is then not only to adapt the con-
tent for patients but also to explain to them the objective of treatments and
procedures, the meaning of diseases, the anatomy of an organ and its sur-
rounding tissue, etc. In this case, the aim is to help patients to understand
their illness and the usefulness of medical treatment, and, in this way, to
make the interaction between medical staff and patients more efficient.
The resources needed for this purpose are multi-fold. According to the
solutions chosen, they and can be provided by different media (i.e., text,
image, video).

In the section 10, the recommendations devoted to the educational pur-
pose are marked (e).
10 Recommendations
In this section, we address the recommendations which can be used for
the creation and detection of patient-friendly documents and their evalu-
ation. These recommendations are formed of a set of criteria from differ-
ent levels of the content and structure of documents: morphology (sec-
tion 10.1), lexicon and terminology (section 10.2), syntax (section 10.3),
personalisation (section 10.4) and document layout and presentation (sec-
tion 10.5). These criteria define a preliminary coarse grouping of prob-
lem areas, which however turns out to correlate well with a grouping of
the recommendations, according to the specific solutions and resources in-
volved. It is important to note that these different levels and criteria partic-
ipate all together in the creation and description of expert and non-expert
documents, and that they are interrelated inside the discourses which are
specific to experts and to non-experts.
At each level of criteria:
• we first present observations of differences between expert and pa-
tient languages as they emerged from the research studies,
• and then propose solutions suitable for the adapting of medical doc-
uments to patients’ needs.
These recommendations have mainly been compiled from the previous
literature survey (Åhlfeldt et al. 2006) and from the corpus study described
in part II of this report. The legal aspect, that is to whom the generated
documents can be distributed, is not addressed here.
10.1 Morphology
The morphology level addresses word formation processes: Definition of
the morphological components used for the creation of “new” words and
their analysis. Note that this level is related to the level of lexicon and
terminology (sec. 10.2), as words formed at the morphological level will
further be used for the creation of terms.
10.1.1 Observed problems
It has been observed that medical jargon has a tendency to use Latin terms
(Surján & Héja 2003; Krivine 2005; Kokkinakis & Toporowska Gronostaj
2006):
44 SEMANTIC MINING DELIVERABLE D27.2
{axilla, armpit}, {derm, skin}, {adip-, fat}
as well as large number of abbreviations and acronyms. Additionally, Bo-
denreider & Pakhomov (2003) show that longer words are an indication of
technical terminology. But according to the Swedish corpus study (Kokki-
nakis & Toporowska Gronostaj 2006 and section 4.2.3 above), in Swedish
documents, there is no important difference of the use of compound forms
in expert and non-expert documents, which is due probably specifically to
this language.7
10.1.2 Solutions
For the generation of patient-friendly documents at the morphological
level:
(t) terms and words with local (English, French, Swedish, etc) roots
should be preferred. The paraphrasing with the MorphoSaurus
(Markó, Schulz & Hahn 2005; Schulz 2007) tool or with synonyms
recorded in various biomedical terminologies, such as Snomed,
MeSH, can be helpful for this purpose.
(e) anyway, if used, Greek and Latin roots should be explained.
10.2 Lexicon and terminology
The level of lexicon and terminology addresses the creation and especially
usage of medical terms in order to introduce and describe medical con-
cepts.
10.2.1 Observed problems
At the lexical and terminological levels, many previous studies have ob-
served differences between expert and non-expert documents. The results
indicate that a doctor’s choice of vocabulary affects patient satisfaction
immediately after a general practice consultation and that using the same
vocabulary as the patient can improve patient outcomes (Williams & Og-
den 2004). Thus, the common finding states that the terminology used by
medical doctors should be adapted to patient knowledge (Bouhaddou &
Warner 1995; Waisman et al. 2003; White, Singleton & Jones 2004).
7But note that “compounds” and “long words” are two largely independent param-
eters. True, a compound will on the average be longer than a simplex word, but there
are longer and shorter compounds, just as there are longer and shorter simplex words,
and it is a fair assumption that the longer compounds will be found more often in the
professional part of the corpus.
SEMANTIC MINING DELIVERABLE D27.2 45
For instance, in previous research it has been noted that patients could
not recognise the equivalence between several synonymous terms, as in
the following examples:
• {bleeding, hemorrhage}
• {broken, fractured}, {break, fracture}
• {heart attack, myocardial infarction}
• {stitches, sutures}
• {diarrhoea, loose stools}
• {cast, splint}
While with other terms, patients have difficulties in defining them, e.g.:
metastasis, meningitis, lethargy, virus, hypertension, strep throat,
herpes, tumor, Pap smear, uterus, fever (Thompson 2005), rheuma-
tism, ...
In sum, any technical medical term can potentially present understanding
problems for patients.
10.2.2 Solutions
For the generation of patient-friendly documents at the terminological and
lexical level, several solutions are possible:
(e) Use of explanations through a special discharge nurse as well as use
of written information (Waisman et al. 2003);
(e) Use of multimedia which is supposed to provide a comfortable en-
vironment to learn about medical problems (Miyawaki et al. 1995).
Notice that previous projects (Magic (McKeown et al. 1997), Med-
View (Torgersson & Falkman 2002), Persival (Elhadad & McKeown
2001)) attempted to do so, but often different media were not inte-
grated;
(e) Use of pictures and graphical material for the explanations;
(e) Systematic use of definitions of technical terms as corpora analysis
has suggested. In order to collect definitions of medical terms, it
is possible to use medical web sites and portals which exist in sev-
eral countries and languages, and which provide (directly, or link to)
publicly available resources:
46 SEMANTIC MINING DELIVERABLE D27.2
– the MedLinePlus portal8 of American governmental health web
sites;
– the Health on the Net Foundation9 portal lists over 1,200,000
accredited web pages in numerious languages;
– the Swedish web site of the National Board of Health and Wel-
fare10 covers about 150 general terms with their definitions and
comments;
– the Cancer Research portal11 in the UK covers various terms re-
lated to this area;
– the French portal CISMeF12 indexes over 12,000 web pages in
French.
(t) Use of patient terms, compiled into “problem lists” (Lauteslager
et al. 2002; Miller et al. 2003; Bui et al. 2004). Often, these patient
“problem lists” are bootstrapped manually from medical consulta-
tion notes (from patient emails or other) and then matched to exist-
ing controlled terminologies (Campbell & Payne 1994; Hales, Schoef-
fler & Kessler 1998; Smith, Stavri & Chapman 2002; Brenna & Aron-
son 2003; Tse & Soergel 2003; Plovnick & Zeng 2004; Fabry et al.
2005). Notice that only a few resources with patient terms are avail-
able for wide usage and that only the MedlinePlus resource, included
in the UMLS, seems to provide the actual alignment between expert
and patient terms. Some of these resources are:
– the UMLS (NLM 2003) resource includes such a layman termi-
nology, MedlinePlus (Zeng & Tse 2006), compiled from the Med-
linePlus portal. The MedlinePlus covers over 1,400 terms;
– the Consumer Health Vocabulary Initiative13 partners gather
patient oriented resources: i.e., MedlinePlus, ClinicalTrials.gov,
Centers for Disease Control: Topic Index and Food & Drug Adminis-
tration: Information for Consumers;
– the Medical WordNet (Smith & Fellbaum 2004) initiative, which
seems to be currently under development, would propose a
resource of layman oriented medical terms aligned with the
WordNet network of synsets (Fellbaum 1998);
– the Wikipedia14 resources offer explanations and encyclopeadic

SEMANTIC MINING DELIVERABLE D27.2 47
information on various terms in several languages;
– the Swedish terminology bank of the National Board of Health
and Welfare15 currently covers about 600 search terms recom-
mended for use in communication within health care services
and in communication with patients;
– the terminological bank of the Swedish Council on Technology
Assessment in Health Care16 currently covers about 200 terms.
(t) Use of terms paraphrased with the Morphosaurus (Markó, Schulz
& Hahn 2005; Schulz 2007) tool or the ones which can be obtained
from series of synonymes as recorded in various biomedical termi-
nologies, such as Snomed, MeSH, etc:
myocardial infarction: cardiac infarction, heart attack, infarction
of heart.
It seems that patients find technical terms reassuring and respect doc-
tors who use them (Ogden et al. 2003). In this respect, the educational
aspect of patient documents should be preferred. In this case, expert doc-
uments will remain nearly intact, which means that the information con-
veyed would not be affected. But, at the same time, it will be necessary
to add explanations and definitions for patients could understand these
documents.
In order to make decisions automatically about which terms should be
explained the findings about empirical evidence about difference in us-
ages of terms by doctors and patients is helpful.
10.3 Syntax
The syntax level deals with sentence structure and use of part-of-speech
categories when constructing sentences. There are very few investigations
focusing on the syntactical level of medical documents.
10.3.1 Observed problems
As for sentence structure and complexity it is correlated with the readabil-
ity of documents, i.e., the fact whether is it easy or not to understand the
document for a patient.
For instance, Ownby (2005) investigates several aspects of readability,
especially sentence complexity and the use of passive voice, and shows
15<http://app.socialstyrelsen.se/termbank>
16<http://www.sbu.se/ordlista/list.asp>
48 SEMANTIC MINING DELIVERABLE D27.2
that expert and non-expert documents are different in these respects. Pas-
sive constructions and non-finite clauses are thus known to be represen-
tative of scientific texts (Sager, Dungworth & McDonald 1980). Williams
(2003) also shows that sentence and word length influence the readabil-
ity of documents. Sentence complexity can also be observed in the use
of punctuation (Krivine et al. 2006) (i.e., the use of commas, semi-colons,
colons, parentheses, exclamation marks, question marks, quotation marks,
etc.). Thus, as reported in part II of this report, Krivine et al. (2006), Kokki-
nakis & Toporowska Gronostaj (2006) and the OU NLG group thus have
observed that sentences are longer when they are created by experts. E.g.
for Swedish, the token/sentence ratio is 18.7 in expert texts and 14.8 within
non-expert texts. The Flesch readability index (Flesch 1948) computed by
Kokkinakis & Toporowska Gronostaj (2006) and the OU NLG group con-
firms that the readability of expert documents is lower, compared to non-
expert documents, as the length and complexity of sentences and words
in them are higher.
The use of conditional structures (i.e., introduced by if) in patient docu-
ments has been observed in Swedish (Kokkinakis & Toporowska Gronos-
taj 2006), Russian and French (Krivine et al. 2006). But this seems to affect
particularly the content of documents and less the way the content is pre-
sented.
As for the use and distribution of part-of-speech categories, Richard-
son (1996) observed that expert language uses nouns instead of verbs and
adjectives instead of nouns. Indeed, a high frequency of nominalisations
is characteristic of scientific texts (Nordman 1992).
Moreover, Bodenreider & Pakhomov (2003) have explored the be-
haviour of adjectival modifiers across the two written genres using texts
from Medline17 and the Mayo clinic18. They found that a much greater
range of adjectives was used for the wider audience. Grabar & Zweigen-
baum (2003) observed the productivity of denominal adjectives when they
occur in the same document with their base nouns:
{stomach/N, stomachal/A}, {diabetes/N, diabetical/A}, {asthma/N,
asthmatic/A}
The study has been conducted in French on a general language newspa-
per (Le Monde) corpus and a medical corpus collected from the medical
portal CISMeF. They found that such adjectives are more productive and
frequent in the medical corpus. Their use is then correlated with the use
of their base nouns. This observation can be explained by the fact that
such adjectives are components of medical terms, which are widely used
17<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.giv/entrez>
18<http://www.mayoclinic.com>
SEMANTIC MINING DELIVERABLE D27.2 49
in specialised texts. For instance, in such terms, nouns and their adjec-
tives, which refer to the human anatomy, can be used in order to localise
diseases, procedures, etc:
aortic valve prosthesis, injury of subclavian vein, intravenous injec-
tion
Kokkinakis & Toporowska Gronostaj (2006) and the OU NLG group
investigated the use of verbs in expert and non-expert documents, finding
e.g., that Swedish expert documents contain respectively 10% and 1% of
main and auxiliary verbs, while the non-expert documents in the Swedish
corpus contain 12.7% and 2.9% of these categories (see section 4.2.3 above).
The use of verbs is thus more common in patient documents. As correla-
tive to this fact, the use of pronouns, addressed here as “personalisation”
(section 10.4), is also more frequent in non-patient documents. As more
correlation to this fact, the use of nouns is less frequent. Indeed, in this
case, verbs such as (investigate, inform, observe) will be preferred to corre-
sponding nouns (investigation, information, observation).
10.3.2 Solutions
For the generation of patient-friendly documents at the syntactical level,
several solutions are possible:
(t) Content can be organised and formulated using simple and short
sentences (Williams 2003).
(t) The sentences should not contain passive, infinitival structures.
(t) Noun phrases which encode terms can be syntactically transformed
through the POS tagging, shallow parsing and then transformation
rules, for instance with Faster (Jacquemin 1999)
tracheal stenosis ⇒ stenosis of the trachea
catheter ablation of tissue of heart ⇒ excision with catheter of
tissue of the heart
(e) Anyway, if the use of long sentences is preferred, for instance in or-
der to not affect the meaning conveyed, these sentences can be il-
lustrated with additional information, such as definitions and para-
phrases (sec. 10.2), graphical material (sec. 10.5), etc. The access to
the information encoded by such sentences can be interactive so that
the user could read or listen to them again and again.
50 SEMANTIC MINING DELIVERABLE D27.2
10.4 Personalisation or use of personal pronouns
What we call personalisation is the presence of the reader or audience in
the document, often through the use of personal pronouns like you, he,
they, etc. This criterion corresponds to the level at which the sentences
are included in the conversational situations and at which the interaction
between speakers and the discourse are formed.
10.4.1 Observed problems
Krivine et al. (2006), Kokkinakis & Toporowska Gronostaj (2006) and the
OU NLG group have observed that pronouns are more frequent in non-
expert documents compared to expert documents. Indeed, the use of pro-
nouns allows the creator of the documnet to make the content more per-
sonal, while the scientific and expert literature remains “abstract”.
As we noticed in section 10.3, the use of pronouns is correlated with the
frequent use of verbs and infrequent use of nouns. Moreover, several per-
sonal pronouns (1st singular and plural, and 2nd singular and plural) seem
to be one of the most efficient criteria for the automatic discrimination be-
tween expert and patient documents (Krivine et al. 2006). Notice that this
observation will not be suitable for the discrimination, as expert literature,
of discharge letters written by general practitioners to specialists and vice
versa. Actually, these letters show high use of personal pronouns.
Notice additionally that Japanese patient-oriented documents show
the frequent use of “forms of address” (Tomimitsu 2005; Krivine et al.
2006).
10.4.2 Solutions
For the generation of patient-friendly documents at the personalisation
level, the following solutions can be adapted:
(t) Sentences should be generated so as to contain personal pronouns
and corresponding syntactic structures. In this way, patients should
feel more directly addressed by the documents, and may be more
involved in the process of communication with experts. If so, they
can feel more involved in the caregiving process as well.
(t) The sentences can contain structures which would reflect the spoken
language and address patients in a more informal or “polite” way:
well, let’s say, actually, ...
SEMANTIC MINING DELIVERABLE D27.2 51
10.5 Document layout and presentation
“Document layout and presentation” refer to the graphical and logical or-
ganisation of documents. In the case of html documents, layout can be
organised through the usage of the html tags and css files.
10.5.1 Observed problems
Krivine et al. (2006) observed that patient documents show a more com-
plex and sophisticated presentation of information. This observation relies
on several html tags: image capturing <img>, table capturing <table>,
lists <ul> and enumerations <ol>, hypertext tags <a>, and tags for
putting strings into bold <b> and italic <i> characters. Although these
tags are not always used in the expected way, they are much more fre-
quent in patient-oriented documents, as it has been observed in Russian
and French corpora.
10.5.2 Solutions
For the generation of patient-friendly documents at the level of document
layout and presentation, the following solutions can be adapted:
(t) Generation of text with at least minimal structure and itemisation
which would help the reading of the document;
(t) Generation of dialogues, thereby adding a complementary modal-
ity, which could potentially help patients to understand the logical
sequence of events and relationships between the medical concepts
involved;
(e) Use of graphical material (i.e., images and pictures) in order to il-
lustrate the concepts involved (medical devices, body structure and
position of injuries, diseases, procedures, etc), which adds an addi-
tional modality. But notice that, according to Hameen-Anttila et al.
(2004), pictograms did not help children understand patient infor-
mation. Possibly the results would have been different if the pictures
had been better and they had been used in a better context, i.e. in real
information leaflets;
(e) Use of video material in order to better describe and illustrate medi-
cal procedures;
(e) Propose supplementary (hyper)links to more related information.

10.6 Summary
At the different levels of document content and structure, observed
through the contrastive analysis of expert and patient documents, we pro-
pose ways for the adaptation of expert content for patients. Often several
ways are possible and not mutually exclusive. We distinguish especially
the translational and educational purposes of patient-oriented documents
which both allow adaptation of the content of documents for patients.
It seems that the educational purpose is more suitable that the transla-
tion as it would not affect the content but propose additional information
necessary for the understanding of expert statements.
It is remarkable, however, how conflicting the evidence is in the area
of adapting medical documents to patient (Åhlfeldt et al. 2006: sec. 7.2.6).
Thus, several medical informatics studies (Skinner, Strecher & Hospers
1994; Strecher et al. 1994; Campbell et al. 1994; Osman et al. 1994) found
positive effects of tailoring documents to patients’ needs. On the other
hand, studies involving the use of NLG systems (Jones et al. 1994; Lennox
et al. 2001; Reiter, Robertson & Osman 2003; Jones et al. 2006) failed to
demonstrate significant effects of tailoring. Note that there were a number
of differences between the studies (outcomes, medical areas, information
supports involved). Other studies should be conducted. Additionaly, it
seems that in the cancer area, which is characterized by more complex
treatments and surgery and where there may not be such direct ways in
which education can help patients, it is difficult to demonstrate the bene-
fits of tailored information (Jones et al. 1994; Jones et al. 2006).
11 “Proof-of-concept” NLG demonstrator
This section describes requirements for a proof-of-concept demonstration
system for generating patient-friendly summaries and scripted dialogues
from simulated breast cancer patient chronicles. These will be read out
by autonomous agent characters and rendered as short movie clips to be
watched on a computer. This demonstrator uses clinical material prepared
during the ongoing UK CLEF project (Hallett & Scott 2005).
We do not describe “requirements” in the normal computer science
sense but rather research requirements for evaluation of the demonstra-
tor; i.e., how will we measure whether the system achieves its research
objectives. During the short time span for development (i.e., 10 months),
the NLG group from the Open University, UK, has started to address some
of the relevant research issues. The recommendations proposed in the sec-
tion 10 are addressed where possible.
SEMANTIC MINING DELIVERABLE D27.2 53
11.1 Context of Use
We believe that watching short movie clips describing medical case histo-
ries very similar to their own will involve patients in a vicarious learning
experience. That is, an experience where they will benefit and learn from
watching autonomous agent characters discuss a case history. If a patient
were to watch one of these just before her next consultation with a doctor,
it could potentially help her in a number of ways:
• by reminding her of her own case history;
• by giving her practical examples of the meaning and usage of medi-
cal terms relating to her case;
• and (in the case of the scripted dialogues) by demonstrating how to
ask practical medical questions relating to her case.
11.2 Input
The OU NLG group already uses a simulator developed for the ongoing
project CLEF (Hallett & Scott 2005) that simulates “chronicles” of treat-
ment for breast cancer patients in a relational database and generates sum-
maries for doctors. The WP27 NLG demonstrator uses the same chronicle
simulator database as input from which it generates summaries for pa-
tients.
Figure 5: An example of chronicle database tables and semantic links
The chronicle database has a number of tables describing: medical in-
terventions, investigations, problems, etc. These are indexed by simulated
patient IDs. It also contains a relations table that semantically relates en-
tities in the other tables to one another, e.g. an investigation entry in the
investigations table can be related to a problem entry in the problems table
54 SEMANTIC MINING DELIVERABLE D27.2
by an entry of the relations table that links them in an INDICATED_BY
relation (see figure 5). This means that an investigation took place and
found the patient was suffering from a problem such as cancer (provided
that additional fields in the investigation and problem records show that
the investigation was completed and the problem exists). Our generator
uses the links in the relations table to search the other tables and choose
interesting content for the patient summaries.
11.3 Output mode 1: Monologue Summaries
Patient summaries are generated and read out by an autonomous “news-
reader” agent (see figure 6). Commercial text-to-speech software is em-
ployed to make the agent ’speak’ the generated text. The Loquendo text-
to-speech system, used in our demonstrator, <http://:>www.loquendo.com
is available in many languages, e.g. British English, German, French and
Swedish.
The summaries can be saved as movie files that can be played on a com-
puter and viewed on the screen. The summaries will describe episodes in
a simulated patient’s chronicle. For instance, the simulated patient might
have had some tests done and results of the tests may have indicated that
the patient had cancer. The patient may then have had some surgery to
remove the cancer and further treatment, such as chemotherapy to kill
remaining cancer cells. The summary would describe these events and
explain the medical terms involved.
Figure 6: Autonomous “newsreader” agent for reading patient summaries
11.4 Output mode 2: Scripted Dialogues
Monologue summaries are transformed by rules in the NLG system into
scripted dialogues (i.e., similar to scripts for theatrical plays). These are
acted out by autonomous agent characters (see figure 7) and saved, played
and viewed as before.
SEMANTIC MINING DELIVERABLE D27.2 55
Figure 7: Autonomous agents “acting” a scripted dialogue
11.5 NLG Technology
For the proof-of-concept demonstrator, the architecture is relatively sim-
ple. Content selection consists of SQL queries based on our investigations
of the semantic relations in the chronicle database. A document struc-
turing algorithm constructs semantic structures, each of which is repre-
sented by a “medical episode” template with fixed semantic relations be-
tween “medical entities” objects which are built from the results of the SQL
queries and fill slots in the episode template. Medical terms are looked up
in a table of term definitions which are built into “gloss” objects which
also fill slots in the episode structures where they are linked by "expla-
nation" relations. Rules map monologue semantic structures to dialogue
structures (essentially these assign existing parts of the semantic structure
to dialogue turns and add some additional “question” turns). Realisation
is achieved through simple string processing with reference to a simple
discourse history which maintains a list of entities mentioned so far in the
document. The output is formatted as web pages with embedded Active
X commands to control the autonomous agent characters. Movies are pro-
duced from these using screen-capture software.
The system outputs consist of short sentences and short words. Where
medical terms are used, explanations are included. Term definitions are
taken from the Cancer Research UK patient information website and mod-
ified slightly to agree with tense and to use simpler language, where ap-
propriate. This and the two alternative presentation modes should fit the
requirements we specified in section 10.

12 Objectives for the "proof-of-concept" NLG
demonstrator
Watching the monologue and dialogue patient chronicle descriptions
could help patients in a number of ways. Our evaluation will compare
the effectiveness of the two NLG outputs on each of the following objec-
tives:
• communicate descriptions of case histories to patients;
• explain medical terms to patients;
• encourage patients to ask questions during consultations;
• generate outputs that patients enjoy and find helpful;
• and generate outputs that patients find easy to use.
Our hope is that this combination of objectives will have the benefit of
increasing accessibility, especially for patients with little medical knowl-
edge, or poor literacy and numeracy. It will also save doctors’ time by
providing an additional backup source of explanation for patients.
The first two objectives concern effective communication; i.e. the gen-
erated outputs should describe and convey the information in the simu-
lated patient chronicles and the relevant medical terms in a manner that
patients can understand. Obvious issues here are how to express medical
information in an understandable way, how much medical detail to in-
clude and to what scientific depth medical concepts should be described.
On one hand, we require that the system should not patronise adults by
describing concepts in a childish way, nor should it repeat information that
they already know. On the other hand, it can be reassuring for patients to
have their medical knowledge confirmed and repeating information by
summarising it is promoted as good practice in doctor-patient commu-
nication (Silverman, Kurtz & Draper 1998). In an evaluation, we could
determine whether patients and doctors like or dislike the generated de-
scriptions, and why, by asking them. We could also evaluate whether the
descriptions are understandable by asking comprehension questions.
In their guide for communicating with patients, Silverman, Kurtz &
Draper (1998) advocate that before explaining medical information to a
patient, a doctor should assess a patient’s prior knowledge and the ex-
tent of her/his wish for information. In an ideal world, our system would
elicit information about how much medical knowledge patients possess,
and want to acquire, before generating explanations. However, obtain-
ing this information is problematic. Obviously we cannot expect patients
SEMANTIC MINING DELIVERABLE D27.2 57
to fill in lengthy questionnaires about their medical knowledge and how
much they want to know each time we generate descriptions. Further-
more, asking patients whether they understand terms would give inac-
curate results because people overestimate their own medical knowledge;
Chapman et al. (2003) asked 150 members of the public questions about
cancer terms and found that only 52% understood that the phrase “the
tumour is progressing” was bad news, nevertheless the participants were
fairly confident that they understood it. Our own corpus comparison of
doctor-authored vs. patient-authored documents found that some terms
are commonly used by both doctors and patients, some terms are com-
monly used by doctors but not patients, and some are commonly used by
patients but not doctors. We should make use of these statistics, as well
as data from studies such as Chapman et al. 2003 in an algorithm which
the NLG system would use to make a decision about which terms require
explanations to be generated, and which do not.
Our second and third objectives have an educational aspect, i.e. to
teach patients new medical terms, to equip them with language relevant
for their consultations and (in the case of the dialogue output) to show
them examples of how to ask questions during consultations. We hope
that the latter will involve patients in a vicarious learning experience
and encourage them to ask more questions, as demonstrated by Craig
et al. (2000). In our evaluation, we could question patients to determine
whether they would ask more questions in a consultation before and after
they view the generated material.
Our final two objectives concern usability. During evaluation, we can
also determine whether patients find the system usable via a question-
naire.
13 Conclusion
On the basis of the previous literature survey and corpus study, we have
formulated a set of recommendations for adapting expert clinical docu-
ments for patients. The proposed recommendations can fit to translational
or educational purpose. These are not mutually exclusive and can be com-
plementary, but in order to not alter the original expert medical informa-
tion the educational purpose should be preferred. The proposed recom-
mendations concern several levels of the content and structure of docu-
ments: Morphology, lexicon and terminology, syntax, personalisation and
document layout and presentation. At each level, specific solutions and
resources are necessary.
We described as well a prototype Natural Language Generation
demonstrator through which the recommendations can be implemented,
58 SEMANTIC MINING DELIVERABLE D27.2
and gave main the principles of the evaluation of this demonstrator. The
demonstrator will first be applied in the area of breast cancer for the gen-
eration of documents in order to help patient to understand their clinical
case and to improve the communication between patients and physicians.
Part IV
Perspectives
Several perspectives emerge from the work presented in this deliverable.
If, in the future, a more detailed corpus analysis is conducted then
other criteria may emerge from this study, enabling us to make further
contributions to the task of adapting expert documents for patients.
Detection and creation of specific resources (vocabularies, terminolo-
gies, database of definitions, etc.) is necessary for the generation of
patient-friendly documents. Creation of such resources is a specific and
time-consuming task. The importance of this task should not be under-
estimated.
The effective implementation of several or all of the recommendations
within the NLG demonstrator is another perspective. It will allow us to
evaluate the efficency of the presented criteria.
The NLG demonstrator under development currently generates pa-
tient documents in English. As an interesting future development, we
intend to to adapt this demonstrator to other languages, such as French,
Swedish or German. This research will involve, at least: the detection and
selection of the resources needed for such a demonstrator; the translation
and adaptation of content within the languages in this group; the selection
of and translation of the medical terms involved; and the ability to recover
definitions for terms.
