Abstract. This paper presents an early experimental work on BNC Text Categorization (TC) 
with Latin etymologies as features, emphasis on spoken and written texts. Two aims 
achieved in this study: (1) to explore discriminative new linguistic features rather than lots 
of noise-bringing “bag-of-words” (BoW). (2) to build up a base step to represent texts in 
distinct types of linguistic features with different weighting scheme rather than a plain 
feature vectors of BoW. The experiments disclose a notable distinct distribution pattern of 
Latin etymologies in spoken and written BNC texts. The performance of a home-made 
classifier based on the probability distribution ranges of Latin etymologies reaches a 
precision of 72.31% and recall of 73.22% on BNC spoken texts and precision of 73.31% 
and recall of 69.98% on BNC written texts. 
Keywords: Text Categorization, Latin Etymologies, Discriminative Features.

1 Introduction 
Text Categorization (TC) is the task of classifying natural language texts into a predefined set 
of semantic categories (Lan et al., 2006). Features selection is always a bottleneck in the tasks 
of TC, especially the common used BoW introduces a large features space, some of the features 
are redundant, some of them bring noise. The current TC studies are based on features like 
words/phrases frequencies (Olsson and Douglas, 2006), therefore, need (1) features selection 
algorithms such as Information Gain (Wang et al., 2004; Lee and Lee, 2006; Olsson and 
Douglas, 2006; Shang et al., 2007), Mutual Information (Wang et al., 2004; Pei et al., 2007), χ
2
 
(Wang et al., 2004; Olsson and Douglas, 2006; Shang et al., 2007), Maximum Entropy (Nigam 
et al., 1999; B. Chen et al., 2008) etc. A good review on the state-of-art feature selection 
techniques can be found in (Liu and Yu, 2005). However, as stated by (Mukras et al., 2007; 
Shang et al., 2007), these routine feature selection methods may fail to identify discriminatory 
features, particularly when they are distributed over multiple ordinal classes or especially like 
χ
2  
(Olsson and Douglas, 2006) are known to be misled by infrequent terms; (2) features 
transformation technique like Term clustering (Lin and Kondadadi, 2001; Beil et al., 2002), 
Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI) (Wu and Gunopulos, 2002; Kontostathis and Pottenger, 2006) 
so that  the texts can be represented in features vectors; (3) because of this kind of

representation of document, usually need to employ computationally expensive learning 
algorithms from machine learning like Naïve Bayes Classification (Wang et al., 2004; J. Chen 
et al., 2008), Support Vector Machine Classification (Wang et al., 2004; Lan et al., 2006; 
Shang et al., 2007), linear classification (T. Zhang and Oles, 2001; J. Zhang and Y. Yang, 
2003), KNN (Lan et al., 2006; Olsson and Douglas, 2006; Shang et al., 2007), Neural Network 
(Yu et al., 2008) etc. A thorough survey can be found in (Sebastiani, 2002). As stated by (D. 
Zhang and W. S. Lee, 2006), the learning algorithms even the verified most de facto SVM 
algorithm can be neither effective nor efficient to take all selected features straightforwardly. 
This study wishes to explore and verify discriminative features beyond words/phrases 
frequencies based on linguistic analysis and have not been reached yet up to now and limit the 
efficient features set as small as it can be. As stated by (Rogati and Yang, 2002), “The results 
we obtained using only 3% of the available features are among the best reported, including 
results obtained with the full feature set”. In addition, this study provides a base step for the 
future work in which we do not want to deem classified texts as simple as a feature vectors of 
“bag-of-words”, but as different levels of linguistic information, such as the investigated one in 
this study, which is the probabilities of the words having Latin-etymologies in the classified 
texts.  
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the approach proposed. 
Section 3 evaluates the proposed method. And Section 4 opens a discussion and presents the 
outline of the future works.  
2 The Method 
Two lexicographical resources are used in this study. The Collins English Dictionary (CED) is 
a collection of total 128 different languages of etymological knowledge for contemporary 
English, which includes Latin, French, Greek etc. CED contains 249,331 entries which are 
finally found 48,593 words with etymological origins. Another resource is BNC corpus which 
is a 100 million word collection of samples of written and spoken language from a wide range 
of sources, designed to represent a wide cross-section of Modern British English built from 
1991 to 1994. The version used in this study is the BNC XML Edition, released in 2007. 
Recall the observation that a majority of Latinate words are normally used in more formal 
speech and written texts. The first experiment is constructed to verify that the probabilities of 
Latin etymologies are distributed in distinct ranges for BNC spoken and written texts. The 
principles of the experiment is to find exclusive ranges of the probability distribution in Latin 
etymologies for spoken and written texts, therefore, we conducted the experiments on different 
unified size of texts. The approach has three steps: (1) Extract <word, language-etymology> 
pairs like <impress, Latin> from CED as the word list (named wordlist_ety) which contains 
total 48,593 such kind of pairs in the final version. A language list of total 1,362 valid 
languages is used to eliminate the pseudo languages in the above <word, language-etymology> 
pairs. (2) Extract headwords from each text of a given BNC category, which will be further 
refined against the top-2000 stop-word-list discussed in Section 2.1. The refined headwords 
will be processed based on the “wordlist_ety” to summarize their language etymologies which 
is associated with the frequencies, total number of tokens in each text, as well as the local 
probabilities of sub-languages (such as New Latin, Late Latin, Medieval Latin etc) and of 
reduced languages (such as Latin). The sample outputs like < Late Latin, 7, 123, 0.056911> and 
<Medieval Latin, 19, 158 0.031646>, and the reduced one like < Latin, 62, 159, 0.018868>. (3) 
The above statistical values are passed to a home-made range classifier (RangeClassifier) which 
takes a step of 0.05 as the Latin etymology probabilities to automatically seek the best ranges 
based on the different evaluation schemes of precision, recall and F_Score.

2.1 Preprocessing 
BNC texts are originally in uneven size from the minimum of 8KB each to the maximum of 
19,738KB each, in another word, the total number of words in each text is different which 
brings bias when assigning a local value (probability in this study) to the examined features 
(Latin etymologies in this study). In order to achieve a consistent weighting scheme, such as 
consistent probability in investigated features against a unified text size, each BNC text is 
firstly transferred into even sized one counted in the number of words.  
Another preprocessed work for evaluating the performance of the proposed classifier is to 
divide the corpus into training and testing parts. This job is done by randomly selecting 80% of 
texts from each category and another exclusive 20% of texts from the same category. 
Finally, to filter the so called stop-word features from the texts, a filter function is applied to 
generate the top-2000 frequent words calculated against the whole BNC corpus. 
2.2 Features of Latin Etymologies in BNC Texts 
Challenging tasks in text categorization: (1) which features should be selected and (2) what 
type of values to be assigned to the selected features. Well discussed features include single 
tokens/words (Nigam et al., 1999; Olsson and Douglas, 2006), keywords (Wang et al., 2004; 
Anette, 2006), bi-grams/n-grams (Mansur et al., 2006; Kanaris and Stamatatos, 2007), noun 
phrases (Liao et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2006), and syntactic patterns (Lewis, 1992; Johannes et 
al., 1998). Most of the above feature selection requires more engineering effort such as the 
parsing of the texts so that the target syntactic patterns can be identified successfully. 
Furthermore, the classification performance relies on the qualities of the identified features. 
Selected features are assigned a numerical value to show their significance to the 
classification task. Summary of term weighting schemes include binary feature (BI), term 
frequency (TF), inversed document frequency (IDF), TF.IDF, TF.χ
2
, TF.RF (relevance 
frequency) etc borrowed from information retrieval. 
Rather than the reported features, this study examines the frequencies of the words having 
Latin etymologies in the running texts and so far has not been reported. Assigning a so-called 
local probability which is calculated using the number of words with Latin etymologies divided 
by the total number of tokens in the same text. Rather than a feature vector representation of 
texts, each text is represented by the features of the words with Latin etymologies and assigned 
the value of their probabilities against the total number of tokens in the text. All texts under a 
given category contribute a probability ranges for that category which brings a possible distinct 
probability ranges for different categories. The experiments show the existence of such distinct 
ranges for the categories of BNC spoken and written (Table 6a), but multiple overlapped ranges 
for the sub-categories under written (Table 6b). Table 1 and Table 2 show the distribution 
difference of Latin etymologies (Latin-ety) on BNC spoken-written and sub-written texts.

From Table 1, the distribution probability of Latin etymologies in the informal speech texts 
(Conversation), which is 5.91%, is distinct lower than in the written texts, which is 10.82%, as 
well as in the formal speech texts (OtherSpoken), which is 13.63%. 
2.3 RangeClassifier 
The classifiers in the most reported literals on text categorization come from Machine Learning 
algorithms like Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, Naïve Bayes, rule-based learners 
etc which have been proved to be successful in handling feature vectors of texts representation. 
In this study, each text has been reduced into a one-dimensionality feature of Latin etymologies 
in values of local probabilities against the total number of tokens in the running text. Thus, a 
task-based dedicated classification algorithm is implemented to automatically learn the best 
distribution pattern of the proposed features in representation of the texts. Given a range 
(within the wide of 0.05 difference between two ranges) of Latin etymology probabilities, 
RangeClassifier starts from the range (IndexMode) which the most number of texts in the 
category fall in, extends in bi-direction of the left index (IndexL)and the right index (Index)t, 
stops when the best F-score achieved. Table 3 is the algorithm of RangeClassifier in Step three.

The second set of the experiment builds up the best ranges for each category according to 
the training texts, the ranges are then used to classify the testing texts. To well verify the 
performance of RangeClassifier, a 5-fold cross validation scheme is applied. Table 5a/b, and 
Table 6a/b show the best ranges in average measured by precision, recall and F_Score against 
the text size of 4000 words, and 6000 words respectively.

4 Evaluation 
RangeClassifier is tested on the testing data with the number of documents shown in Table 4 
with the variations of the texts size from 1,000 to 11,000 in the step of 1,000. Its performance is 
evaluated by precision P, recall R and F_Score F as defined:

Figure 1 and Figure 2 show the variations of precision and F-score with the size of texts on 
the testing set for spoken-written and sub-written categories. Both figures show that the 
precision increases with the increasing of the text sizes, but the trend moderates after the size of

5 Discussion and Future Work 
The current experiment proves that the features of the different probability distribution on Latin 
etymologies can be used to classify the BNC Conversation and Written, achieves the F_Score 
of 72.76% on conversation and of 71.61% on written. However, the result is not good (36.02% 
of precision for text size of 10,000 words) on the category of OtherSpoken which is mixed with 
formal and informal speeches, while the conversion is consisted of unscripted informal 
speeches. Hence, we conclude that distribution of Latin etymologies is distinct in informal 
spoken and written texts which can be used as a good feature for classifying spoken in informal 
and written.  
To the fact that the performance of this study is not as competitive as the reported studies 
such as around 69% in F_Score using KNN algorithm and 80% in F_Score using SVM in (Lan 
et al., 2006), up to 90% in F_Score using SVM and 83% in F_Score using KNN in (Shang et al., 
2007), another possible future job is to explore other different levels of linguistic features (such 
as the words having Latin etymologies against the other bag-of-words), the different features 
may be assigned a different weighting value to identify their significance.
