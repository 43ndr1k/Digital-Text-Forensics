ABSTRACT
We explore the application of stylometric methods developed for modern texts to rhymed
medieval narratives (Jacob van Maerlant and Lodewijk van Velthem, ca. 1260–1330).
Because of the peculiarities of medieval text transmission, we propose to use highly
frequent rhyme words for authorship attribution. First, we shall demonstrate that these
offer important benefits, being relatively content-independent and well-spread over texts.
Subsequent experimentation shows that correspondence analyses can indeed detect
authorial differences using highly frequent rhyme words. Finally, we demonstrate for
Maerlant’s oeuvre that this highly frequent rhyme words’ stylistic stability should not be
exaggerated since their distribution significantly correlates with the internal structure of
that oeuvre.
STYLE AND AUTHORSHIP
Most statistically or computationally supported research into authorship
attribution is nowadays style-based, convinced ‘that by measuring some
textual features we can distinguish between texts written by different
authors’ (Stamatatos, 2009, p. 538). The basic assumption of such
stylometric research is consequently that each author has a unique set of
linguistic characteristics or a ‘stylome’ (Van Halteren, Baayen, Tweedie,
Haverkort & Neijt, 2005) that can be quantitatively distinguished from

any other author’s style. In this paper we shall focus on the possibilities
of style-based authorship attribution for medieval narratives. Although
authorship attribution has many relevant applications in the domain of
historical studies, it is rarely applied to pre-modern data. In our case
study we shall investigate a corpus of rhymed narratives (by Jacob van
Maerlant and Lodewijk van Velthem) from the medieval Low Countries
(ca. 1260–1330).
An innovative aspect of this research is that it is restricted to rhyme
words, instead of plain words as is common in present-day authorship
attribution, because plain words are typically vulnerable to corruption by
medieval scribes. For present-day authors, highly frequent words have
engendered a lot of scholarly interest, since they would contain reliable
indications about authorship. In the first part of this paper, we shall
therefore assess whether highly frequent rhyme words could be suited for
medieval authorship attribution. Note that many contemporary author-
ship studies tacitly assume that an author’s stylome remains relatively
constant over time as well as across different texts, topics and text
varieties. This supposition has however been challenged (Rudman, 1998).
It has been doubted whether an author’s style is necessarily constant
(Holmes, 1998; Forsyth, 1999; Juola, 2007; Argamon, 2008; Stamatatos,
2009; Luyckx & Daelemans, 2011). In the final part of this paper, we will
therefore attempt to determine to what extent the distribution of highly
frequent rhyme words is affected by non-authorship related factors in the
large oeuvre of a single medieval author.
AUTHORSHIP ATTRIBUTION AND MEDIEVAL LITERATURE
Although computational authorship attribution is surrounded by a
lively discussion elsewhere, the discussion is nearly absent in medieval
philology (500–1500), which is remarkable. One characteristic of
medieval data is namely its problematic survival. For a variety of
reasons (e.g. fires) a lot of important resources such as manuscripts have
not survived or only in a severe state of damage. Therefore, scholars
often lack meta-data on their texts: if a manuscript survives fragmenta-
rily, it is often difficult to determine when or where it was produced. As
far as authorship is concerned, we often possess the least information
in medieval texts. Many texts are of unknown or disputed authorship
and their attribution – to known authors or to the authors of other

anonymous texts – is therefore an important issue. Because of the
particular transmission of medieval texts, authorship attribution for them
is, however, anything but straightforward.
Before the advent of the printing press in Western Europe all copies of
a particular work were manually produced by scribes (Salemans, 2000).
Many medieval manuscripts that survive nowadays are in fact copies (of
copies) of the original author’s text; the original ‘autographs’ have rarely
survived. Manual copying was an error-prone activity, so that scribes
unwillingly introduced mistakes in a copy, ‘corrupting’ the authorial text
(Roos & Heikkilä, 2009). No standard spelling or language existed, so
that spelling was phonological, reflecting a scribe’s personal dialect or
regional spelling habits (Kestemont, Daelemans & De Pauw, 2010).
Apparently, scribes saw no difficulties in adapting their exemplar’s
spelling and language and with each copy a text risked an increased
deviation from the original (Spencer & Howe, 2001). Below is an example
(Table 1) of how one line from the Rijmbijbel, one of the texts dealt with
below, survives from a series of parallel manuscripts (Kestemont & Van
Dalen-Oskam, 2009). Note how scribes have introduced subtle variations
in the text or sometimes even changed the wording.
Recent research has shown that the influence of scribes might be even
larger than previously assumed (Van Dalen-Oskam & Van Zundert,
2007). The alterations that scribes introduced tend to be systematic and
often move beyond mere innocent spelling or dialectal adaptations. In a
number of case studies, it has been shown that medieval scribes had a
‘style’ of their own (Kestemont & Van Dalen-Oskam, 2009). Apparently,

scribes enjoyed a large freedom in adapting texts, even to such an extent
that their appropriation of texts can be modeled. This raises the issue to
what extent the stylistic traits of an original author are preserved in
subsequent copies. The strong impact of scribes suggests that the features
that are traditionally used in authorship attribution might be of
questionable relevance for medieval texts, since these are likely to
contain markers for scribal, rather than authorial identity (Kestemont,
2010b).
One interesting and practical bypass for this problem has been
suggested: rhyme words (Besamusca, 2003). Throughout the Middle
Ages a good deal of the literature was rhymed, an acoustic quality of
texts that was of course important for a semi-literate culture, in which
literature was received through oral recitation rather than silent reading.
For instance in the medieval Low Countries, the rhymed couplet was the
preferred verse form for most of the narrative literature until well into the
late medieval period (Lie, 1994). The rhymed couplet (aabbccdd . . .) was
often used to structure medieval epics of a larger size. What is interesting
is that rhyme words tend to be a stable element in medieval text
transmission, very robust to scribal corruption (Kestemont, 2010b).
Scribes generally refrained from manipulating the underlying rhyme
words of a text (Besamusca, 2003), as is also clear from Table 1. It is of
course cumbersome to try and change the rhyme words of a text, if one
is not to rewrite a considerable piece of it. Even if scribes did change
the spelling of rhyme words, the underlying lexemes were often left
untouched.
It therefore makes sense to apply stylometric methods to the lexemes
(lemmas) of words in rhyme position, since these are likely to contain
non-contaminated indications about the original authorship of texts. The
number of possible rhyme word combinations in a language is moreover
limited: authors were bound to often recycle rhyme words. It is not
inconceivable that they would display individual predilections for a
subset of these words, and use them as ‘stopgaps’ or ‘mnemonics’, once
they had proven useful. Frequently recurring rhyme words could
therefore function as the ‘fingerprint’ of an author. The objective of
this paper is therefore to study these rhyme words by means of a
representative case study and determine whether it is feasible to apply
stylometric methods to them. Note that we shall study the use of rhyme
words in isolation from the combinations they appear in (e.g. pairs in
the case of the couplet). Although rhyme combinations could contain

markers of authorial style too, they fall outside the scope of the present
study.
CASE-STUDY: MAERLANT AND VELTHEM
Our case study is taken from the medieval Low Countries and focuses on
the surviving works of two medieval Dutch authors (Jacob van Maerlant
and Lodewijk van Velthem). Jacob van Maerlant (ca. 1240 - ca. 1300)
was undoubtedly one of the most influential authors of the medieval Low
Countries – one medieval poet called him the ‘founding father of all poets
who wrote in Dutch’ (Van Oostrom, 1996). Maerlant has left us an
extensive oeuvre of narrative texts. The following schema (Table 2)
introduces the texts included in our corpus. Our corpus is described in
detail at the end of this paper.
In this schema, the texts have been ranked according to their date of
composition, suggested by the current state of the art in the research field
(Van Oostrom, 1996). Some specific problems have to be taken into
account. Both M2 and M3 survive in two unique manuscripts and for
both of them there are indications that they might be heavily corrupted
by the compilers of these manuscripts (Besamusca, Sleiderink & Warnar,
2009). It will therefore have to be determined whether these versions

sufficiently preserve the original style of the author. In M4 Maerlant
included a text known to be written by another author, Segher
Diengotgaf (Kestemont, 2010a). Because of the unclear status of this
interpolation, we have excluded this part of M4 from our corpus.
Regarding M5, it has been doubted whether Maerlant has actually
written it – his name only appears in two of the three surviving
manuscripts – and moreover its date of composition is sometimes
doubted (Van Oostrom, 1996). Although recent studies do not seem to
doubt this anymore, this issue needs special attention. The technique of
authorship attribution especially lends itself for addressing it.
It should be noted that the size of Maerlant’s oeuvre is fairly large for
a medieval author. Selecting a contemporary oeuvre that parallels
Maerlant’s is not without problems. Lodewijk van Velthem (beginning of
the fourteenth century) seems the safest option. Velthem was a great
admirer of Maerlant, even to such extent that he has been characterized
the executor of Maerlant’s literary testament (Van Oostrom, 1996). Only
two works survive that can be attributed without any doubt to Velthem
(Table 3).
Both works are continuations of two of Maerlant’s works: V1 is, for
instance, the sequel to M9 (see Table 2). V2 firmly builds upon M2 and
is in fact extant from the same unique manuscript. The lack of an
independent tradition for M2 has sometimes raised the question to what
extent Velthem altered Maerlant’s original text (Besamusca, Sleiderink &
Warnar, 2009). Note that the same is true for M3: it survives in a single
manuscript, probably compiled by Velthem. Especially in this case, it is
often claimed that Velthem might have manipulated Maerlant’s M3 to a
large extent.
Because of the literary proximity between these authors, this corpus
serves as a good test case for authorship attribution. Our hypothesis is
that, if rhyme words can serve as reliable indicators of authorship, it
should be possible to distinguish the texts containing the typical rhyme
word ‘fingerprint’ that each author has left on them. The rhyme words in

this corpus have been tokenized and lemmatized (Kestemont et al., 2010).
All the experiments below are restricted to these lemma tags (i.e. the
underlying lexemes), in order to abstract away from superficial spelling
variation introduced by scribes. The schema in Table 4 presents some
general facts about the lemmatized versions of the texts and rhyme words
in this corpus.
AUTHORSHIP AND HIGH-FREQUENCY ITEMS
Although additional linguistic characteristics (such as syntax or character
n-grams) are widely studied, lexical features remain popular in author-
ship attribution studies (Stamatatos, 2009). In these studies, text samples
are represented as vectors, consisting of a fixed number of parameters
indicating the normalized frequencies of a set of words. The main
advantages of lexical features are that (a) their performance is generally
acceptable; (b) their extraction generally requires little linguistic
preprocessing (except tokenization); and (c) their stylistic relevance is
often easy to interpret. Note that authorship attribution based on lexical
features often does benefit from the inclusion of additional (e.g. syntax-
based) feature types but that these other features types in isolation rarely
outperform lexical features (Van Halteren et al., 2005; Luyckx &
Daelemans, 2011). One feature type that generally does outperform

lexical features are character n-grams (Luyckx & Daelemans, 2011).
However, because of scribal interference, these features are difficult to use
for medieval authors (Kestemont & Van Dalen-Oskam, 2009).
Not all words are traditionally included in analyses, and feature
selection is used to decrease the dimensionality of a problem by
representing only the most relevant features. One obvious feature
selection method is the restriction to the n most frequent items
(Stamatatos, 2009). Only the n items that are most frequent in the entire
data set are used in the representation of text samples, an approach that
is again simple and language independent (at least, for most western
languages). This feature selection method often yields excellent results
and sometimes even outperforms more refined selection methods.
Although many values for n have been proposed in the literature,
ranging from 30 to 1000 (Stamatatos, 2009), researchers often limit
themselves to a small number of frequent items, often less than 100
(Holmes, 1998). The reason for this is that the first hundred or so highly
frequent words from any natural language corpus tend to consist of
function or stop words, belonging to closed linguistic classes such as
articles or prepositions. These highly frequent items are of distinct
relevance in authorship studies because they are, among other things,
typically (Stamatatos, 2009):
– used by all authors in a corpus (reliable base of comparison);
– to a lesser extent related to content than less frequent words (such as
topic-specific nouns);
– not under an author’s conscious control (robust to imitation);
– statistically reliable because of their high frequency;
According to the literature, representing text samples by their highly
frequent lexical items and analyzing how these items are distributed in
different texts seems to be a rather simple but reliable and well-anchored
way of attributing texts to authors.
Interestingly, these ideas have a close art-historical parallel in the views
of Giovanni Morelli (1816–1891). Many historical paintings have
survived anonymously, hence the large-scale research into the authorship
attribution of pictorial works. Morelli was among the first to suggest that
the attribution of, for instance, a Quattrocento painting to some Italian
master, could not happen based on ‘content’. How Christ was depicted in
a crucifixion scene or what kind of coat Mary Magdalene was wearing,

seemed all too much dictated by contemporary fashion or stylistic
influences. He proposed to back off to inconspicuous details such as ears,
hands and feet: such ‘functional’ elements were highly frequent in nearly
all paintings because they were largely content-independent. It is a
beautiful illustration of the stylometric findings discussed, that according
to Morelli, authorship attribution in art history should be based on such
frequent though inconspicuous elements – a painting’s function words.
THE DISPERSION OF ‘STOPGAPS’
As argued by the well-known linguist George K. Zipf, the words in any
natural language corpus tend to be characterized by the following
regularity: if the words from such a corpus are sorted in a list by
decreasing frequencies, the word frequencies will be inversely propor-
tional to their rank in the list (Zipf, 1949). Zipf formulated a series of
famous laws to capture these regularities. A typical expression of this law
can be visualized by ordering the words in a corpus according to their
overall frequency and plot these words as points in a two-dimensional
space, with the logarithm of their rank on the vertical axis and the
logarithm of their frequency on the horizontal axis (Manin, 2009). The
result (at least, the fitting regression line) will resemble a straight line with
a slope that approximates71. Zipf’s laws should be handled with care:
they are not a universal constant and they are highly dependent on the
nature and size of text samples (Baayen, 2001; Köhler, 2005; Tuzzi et al.,
2009). Nevertheless, the inverse relationship between rank order and
frequency is interesting for authorship studies with their strong emphasis
on the small ‘crest’ of highly frequent and well-spread items. Applied to
rhyme words, we would like to find out whether rhyme word vocabulary
has a similar crest of highly frequent, well-spread items that could be
used for authorship attribution. In terms of poetics, we would expect
such a crest to consist of ‘stopgaps’ or a nifty set of relatively vague and
content-independent rhyme words that authors often use because of
their generic employability. The notion of stopgaps has invited a lot of
consideration in traditional philology, but so far has rarely been explored
from a quantitative perspective.
If we plot the Zipf-curve (log rank as a function of log frequency) for
the ranked list of rhyme words in our corpus (Figure 1), we see that these
rhyme words seem to follow a Zipfian distribution. Note that the slope of

the fitted regression line in Figure 1 is lower (71.61) than the value of
71 in the ‘classic’ Zipf curve. However, fitting a linear model in which a
word’s logarithmic frequency is predicted by its logarithmic rank yields a
highly significant outcome (F(1, 5478)¼ 113700, p5 .0001, adjusted R2:
0.95), demonstrating a linear relationship between these two variables in
the current data set. It is important that rhyme words show a ‘Zipf-like’
distribution, a first indication that rhyme words as well have a crest of
highly frequent, functional stopgaps that can be used in authorship
attribution.
High-frequency words are considered interesting in authorship
attribution, not because they are highly frequent in individual texts or
oeuvres, but also because they tend to be frequent in all texts and
oeuvres. All authors need to use e.g. definite articles and prepositions.
These words thus ‘scale’ well to different texts, topics and oeuvres: they
tend to be relatively independent from e.g. text variety, frequent and well
spread over text samples. These three aspects are of course related: words
can only be highly frequent and well spread over a large corpus, if they
are indeed independent of text variety and vice versa. For the time being,

we cannot know for sure whether rhyme words display the same
characteristics, although the Zipf-like distribution in Figure 1 suggests
this to be the case.
Suppose, however, that a particular rhyme word is extremely frequent
in one specific large text in the corpus (note that some texts are
considerably larger than others, see Table 2). In that case, the rhyme
word might pop up in the list of most frequent words in the corpus as a
whole, although it is actually only frequent in one text and will not ‘scale’
very well to other texts. If we are to use highly frequent rhyme words
for medieval authorship attribution, we first should determine whether
these frequent rhyme words share the important characteristics of
content-independence and good spread with their non-rhyme counter-
parts in modern texts. In the remainder of this section we shall use two
procedures to determine this: firstly, the inverse document frequency, a
weighting measure from information retrieval that depends on the mere
occurrence of words (i.e. a Boolean value) in a collection of text samples,
and secondly, the coefficient of variation that considers the actual
frequency (i.e. real number) of words in samples.
These two measures we shall propose hereafter are strongly related to
the concept of polytextuality (or polytexty) in quantitative linguistics.
This is a modern systems-theoretical notion that has been coined in the
framework of Synergetic Linguistics (Köhler, 1986; 2005). It considers
the dispersion of linguistic (e.g. lexical) elements over text. This
framework is especially relevant with respect to our specific research
question. Note that the mere frequency of a lexical item depends on the
communicative relevance of its meaning(s)/function(s) (Köhler, 2005) – a
function word is frequent because it fulfills a communicatively important
function. Note that frequency is, theoretically speaking, necessarily a
function of dispersion but that this does not hold the other way around.
From a theoretical point of view, high-frequency words need not have a
high degree of dispersion (although this will often be true in practice).
Essentially, our research question as such essentially relates to one of
Köhler’s synergetic laws: if a rhyme word is frequent in the whole corpus,
is it then also frequent in parts of that corpus (Köhler, 1986)?
The first measure we can use in this respect is the inverse document
frequency (IDF). This weighting measure is used in information retrieval
to find out how specific a term is to a given document in a certain

Highly frequent words tend to be not document-specific and thus
generally have a low IDF. Words that are rather document-specific, such
as for instance hapaxes, tend to have high IDF’s. Therefore, there is
generally a strong correlation between the rank of a word in a frequency
list and its IDF. In terms of quantitative linguistics IDF is a simple
transformed proportion that relates to a term’s polytextuality: the lower
a term’s IDF, the more ‘polytextual’ (communicatively relevant) it is
(cf. Köhler, 2005). Note that neither the logarithm nor its base is in fact
extremely important in the calculation, although this particular
implementation remains standard in information retrieval.
To investigate whether this correlation would also hold true for rhyme
words and to avoid the pitfall that a high-frequency rhyme occurred only
in one text or even part of that text, we divided all texts in our corpus in
equally-sized samples of 1000 rhymes, which yielded a total number of
184 samples for the corpus. Subsequently we listed the rhyme words
occurring in these samples, ranked by their overall frequency in the
corpus and collected for each rhyme word its relative frequency in each
individual sample. Subsequently, we calculated the IDF for each word in
the ranking in each of these 184 samples. By working with equal sample
sizes we disentangled frequency and spread: high-frequency rhyme words
that are well-spread across the set of 1000 samples should have a lower
IDF than equally high-frequency rhymes that are restricted to fewer
samples. Below, we have plotted the rank of these rhyme words and the
corresponding IDF for these words in the collection (Figure 2).
As is clear from this figure there is indeed a significant positive
correlation between the frequency rank of a word in the corpus as a
whole and its IDF over samples of that corpus (F(1, 5599)¼ 36550,
p5 .0001, adjusted R2¼ 0.87), indicating that rhyme words that are
relatively more frequent in the corpus are generally less ‘sample-specific’
than words with a relatively lower frequency in the corpus as a whole.
Hence, the higher the overall frequency of a rhyme word, the better its
spread.
Nevertheless, this way of working arguably overestimates the spread of
words. First of all, since not all works are of equal length, longer works

are able to contribute more samples than shorter works. Secondly, the
amount of Maerlant data severely outbalances the amount of data from
Velthem. We therefore performed two subsequent analyses on subsets of
the corpus. In the first one, we dropped the shorter texts (M2, M3, M5)
and divided the first 10.000 rhyme words of the texts into samples of
length 1000 (80 in total). We then performed the same IDF analysis on
these samples as above. In a second analysis, we performed the IDF
procedure on a selection that was balanced between Maerlant and
Velthem, using 1000 word samples (56 in total) of the first 14.000 lines of
4 texts (M1, M9, V1 and V2), granting an equal share to both authors.
The results of these procedures were nearly identical to the initial one and
are therefore not discussed further for the sake of brevity.
Note that IDF has one drawback as a tool for polytextuality-related
measurements: it is based on the mere occurrence of a word in a given
document (Boolean value) and does not consider the actual frequency of
the word in that document (real number), so that it doesn’t matter
whether the words occurs 20, 200 or 50.000 times in a given document.
Another, arguably more fine-grained means of measuring a word’s
Fig. 2. Inverse document frequency versus word rank for 5601 rhyme words in 181 samples
of 1000 rhyme words and the corresponding linear model (formula: IDF¼ 0.65þ

dispersion is the coefficient of variation (CV). This relatively simple statistic
measure calculates the ‘relative variability’ in a series of observations
and is defined as the ratio of the standard deviation over the mean for
a series of observations (Lewontin, 1966). Consider a dummy corpus
that only uses 5 words, occurring in five samples of equal size (Table 5).
Clearly, the CV of a word captures its dispersion in this dummy corpus:
the lower a word’s CV, the better its spread; the higher a CV, the more
unstable the word’s occurrence. A CV of 0 would mean that the word is
equally frequent in all samples, i.e., that the standard deviation in the
nominator of the ratio is 0. In terms of quantitative linguistics, a word’s
CV seems a fairly faithful way to capture its dispersion or ‘polytextuality’
(in fact, it seems more faithful than IDF which only considers Boolean
occurrences of a word). We have applied the CV-measure to the same
subcorpora as used in our IDF analysis. For instance for the first analysis,
we first divided the texts in the corpus in samples of equal size, again
using 184 samples of 1000 rhymes. Then, we created a list of all words
occurring in those samples, ranked from frequent to less frequent. Next,
we walked through the frequency list, calculating the CV for all words in
the samples. The results are presented in Figure 3. We performed the
same analysis for the subcorpora that we also used with the IDF measure.
Again this yielded no significant differences with respect to this trend.
These results too (Figure 3) reveal a strong positive correlation between a
word’s overall frequency in the corpus and its CV over samples of the
corpus (F(1, 5599)¼ 69170, p5 .0001, adjusted R2¼ 0.93).
The outcome of this section shows that the distribution of high
frequency rhyme words (i.e. their degree of polytextuality) seems to offer
the same benefits as high-frequency non-rhyme words in modern texts:
they are frequent throughout the corpus and display a good dispersion
over individual samples and oeuvres, suggesting relative content-
independence and good scalability from one text to another. Hence,
they are reliable indices for authorship attribution of medieval texts. We
will now turn to this issue.

experiment with a Principal Components Analysis (PCA) or Correspon-
dence Analysis (CA), based on the n most frequent lexical items in the

corpus (Holmes, 1998, pp. 113–114). These are unsupervised statistical
procedures that try to transform a number of possibly correlated
variables into a smaller number of uncorrelated variables or dimensions,
often for the purpose of visualization. Their main advantage is that they
can be easily applied to any corpus, since they are language-independent
and require little preprocessing. Nevertheless, when plotting texts in the
lower-dimensional space of the first dimensions (called ‘components’ or
‘factors’) resulting from such an analysis, texts of identical authorship
tend to cluster. We performed a CA (Nenadić & Greenacre, 2007) of our
corpus, selecting 81 samples of 2156 lines, so that the shortest text (M5)
would be fully included. We used the 50 most frequent rhyme words in
the corpus. When plotting the first two dimensions resulting from the CA
we get the results shown in Figure 4. Analyses with different numbers
(between 50 and 150) of rhyme words yielded similar results. Note that
we have only plotted the texts in these plots (the ‘rows’ in the CA’s) and
left out the features (the ‘columns’) in order not to overload the plots
with information.

Note that two clusters appear in Figure 4: the first dimension is
horizontally separating Velthem’s works (V1, V2) from the rest of the
works in the corpus. Interestingly, M3 is far closer to Velthem’s works
than Maerlant’s: as we mentioned in the introduction, there were serious
doubts as to whether Maerlant’s style was still present in M3, since the
compiler of the manuscript (Velthem) might have corrupted the text to a
large extent. This CA strongly suggests that this is indeed the case. M2,
on the other hand, does not seem to have suffered an equally large
stylistic contamination and so far seems to reflect Maerlant’s style rather
faithfully. Note that M5 – a text whose provenance has occasionally
been doubted in the past – does not jump out in the analysis and seems
to blend in neatly with the rest of Maerlant’s texts. Although this
analysis by itself (with only one control author) cannot be used as
proof for Maerlant’s authorship of the text, it certainly does not offer
additional reasons to doubt the traditional attribution of M5 to
Maerlant.

INTRA-OEUVRE STABILITY
The fact that such a large share of Maerlant’s oeuvre is included in the
data set enables some interesting intra-oeuvre analyses. It would be
informative to inspect the stability of authorial traits in his texts. The
result of CA of Maerlant’s texts in the corpus, again for the 50 most
frequent rhyme words (with 68 samples of 2156 rhymes) is presented
Figure 5. Analyses for other numbers of highly frequent rhyme words
(between 50 and 150) revealed strongly similar outcomes.
Here, we see three clusters emerging from the corpus: M1, M2 and M4
versus M5 and M6 versus M7, M8 and M9. In order to determine
whether this clustering effect is in fact significant, we have computed the
Tukey’s Honest Significant Differences between the positions of the
samples from these three supposed clusters (respectively CHIV, HIST
and DIDAC) in both dimensions of the CA (Figure 6). Importantly, this
method considers all pair wise comparisons between the three groups we

have defined, while still reporting conservative p-values (Baayen, 2008).
This way of working has been inspired by the work of Juola (2007), using
bivariate statistics to demonstrate that the positions of works from
the oeuvre of one author showed a pattern when plotted in a lower-
dimensional space (obtained with Multi-Dimensional Scaling).
Figure 6 demonstrates that there is generally a strong correlation
between the samples’ coordinates and the three clusters we have visually
distinguished: with these statistical tests, all differences whose range does
not intersect zero are significant, which is true for all of them, except the
difference in the first dimension between on the one hand M1, M2 and
M4 and on the other handM7,M8 andM9, i.e., the comparison between
Maerlant’s chivalric and historiographical works (p¼ .62, all others
p5 .0001). A non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis rank sum test – also for
higher numbers of rhyme words in the analysis – further supported the
effect that the positions of samples from the three clusters show
significant differences in both dimensions of the CA (1st dimension:
w2(2)¼ 18.55, p5 .0001; 2nd dimension: w2(2)¼ 53.14, p5 .0001).
The bottom line of these statistical results is that this analysis sets out
from a feature set of highly frequent rhyme words that are suited for
authorship attribution – as demonstrated above – but that this need not
imply that this same feature set should display stability or uniformity
within the oeuvre of one author. On the contrary: the result of a
correspondence analysis of these highly frequent rhyme words clearly

shows that their distribution over Maerlant’s texts reflects the internal
structure of his oeuvre. M1, M2 and M4 were Maerlant’s first three
works and they all belong to the text variety of chivalric epics. M5 and
M6, Maerlant both wrote in the middle of his career but both these texts
have a very ethical, didactic character. M7, M8 and M9 were the last
works Maerlant wrote but all three of them seem to belong to the genre
of historiography (or hagiography). Note that the mutual differences
between chivalric and historiographic texts are less outspoken, especially
in the first dimension, than the differences between these two groups and
the didactic group. From the point of view of poetics, this makes sense
since texts from the historiographic and chivalric genres tend to be
characterized by a similar kind of narrativity – in the end, they both ‘tell
stories’ – and can thus be expected to employ similar highly frequent
words to express a sequence of actions.
CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE RESEARCH
In this paper we have explored the application of stylometric methods
developed for modern texts to medieval narratives. Because of the
peculiarity of medieval text transmission, highly frequent words are an
unreliable base for authorship attribution. We have therefore proposed
to use the highly frequent rhyme words in these narratives, since these are
likely to contain markers for authorial identity. In the first section we
have demonstrated that highly frequent rhyme words offer the same
benefits for authorship attribution as normal highly frequent words in
modern texts: two analyses (based on the inverse document frequency and
coefficient of variation) show that they are relatively content-independent
and well-spread over our corpus.
Further experimentation suggested that rhyme words are indeed suited
for medieval authorship attribution. An unsupervised correspondence
analysis of frequent rhyme words in the corpus was able to detect the
authorial structure in our data, furthermore reflecting (and supporting)
the state of the art in the traditional secondary literature about these texts.
Importantly, however, while highly frequent rhyme words thus seem to
offer the same benefits as function words, their stability within one
author’s works should not be exaggerated. The results of a correspon-
dence analysis of the highest frequency rhyme words in Maerlant’s
oeuvre revealed a significant correlation with its internal meta-structure.

Even if these ‘stopgaps’ seem suited for authorship attribution because of
their content-independence, they seem indeed only relatively content-
independent. Further research is needed to determine to which extent
such intra-oeuvre differences interfere with inter-oeuvre differences. For
medieval as well as present-day authors, it is clear that the challenging
task of cross-text variety authorship attribution should be among
stylometry’s main priorities in the coming years. The current state of
the art clearly cannot exclude the possibility that computational
authorship attribution might only be reliable within the ‘comfort zone’
of a single text variety.
CORPUS DESCRIPTION
The selections from M9 and V1 are discussed in Kestemont (2010b) (but
without the passages therein that are of doubtful provenance, i.e. the
Heelu-interpolations and Book 4 of the fifth part). For the demarcation
of the excluded Segher-part in M4, see Kestemont (2010a). The versions
of M6 and M7 are the complete digital versions from the Corpus-
Gysseling, maintained and annotated by the Institute for Dutch
Lexicology (Leyden). The rest of these texts have been entirely harvested
in their digital form from the standard editions on the Cd-rom
Middelnederlands (1996). Note that for some texts (such as V2) only a
representative sample is used. The Maskeroen-passage was not included
in M2 (Besamusca, Sleiderink & Warnar, 2009). The enriched version of
the corpus will be made available for download in the public domain via
the corresponding author’s homepage.
