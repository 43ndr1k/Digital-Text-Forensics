Abstract
This paper reports an experiment in authorship attribution
in which statistical measures and methods that have been
widely applied to words and their frequencies of use are
applied to rewrite rules as they appear in a syntactically
annotated corpus. The outcome of this experiment sug-
gests that the frequencies with which syntactic rewrite
rules are put to use provide a better clue to authorship
than word usage. Complementary methods focusing on
the high-frequency head and the low-frequency tail of the
distribution independently reveal a higher resolution than
traditional word-based analyses, and promise enhanced
accuracy for authorship attribution.
1. Introduction
A number of recent contributions to authorship attri-
bution are based on words and their frequencies of
occurrence (see, for example, Burrows (1992, 1993),
Holmes and Forsyth (1995) and Holmes (1994) for a
general review of methods for authorship attribution).
This comes as no surprise, as the statistical analysis of
word frequencies requires minimal textual preprocess-
ing. Nevertheless, precisely those words which have
proved to have a high discriminatory resolution in the
seminal work by Burrows (1992, 1993), the so-called
function words (a, the, that, and, but, ..., etc.), appear
to tap into the use of syntax. This suggests it might be
profitable to study the use of syntax directly.
We designed a statistical experiment using syntacti-
cally annotated corpus material to investigate the dis-
criminatory potential of syntactic rewrite rules for
authorship attribution. We followed tradition, as exem-
plified in the study by Mosteller and Wallace (1964), in
that we compared texts of unknown authorship with
texts of which authorship is beyond doubt. In our
experiment, however, the authorship of all texts was
known, albeit initially only to the experiment leader,
van Halteren, and not to Tweedie and Baayen, who
carried out the analyses. This considerably simplifies
the process of evaluating the accuracy of the methods
we have used.
The texts, their syntactic annotation, and the details
of the design of our statistical experiment, are intro-
duced in Section 2. In Section 3, we set ourselves a

baseline by studying the accuracy of word-based meth-
ods. In Section 4, we show that analyses that exploit
the frequencies of syntactic rewrite rules instead of the
frequencies of words have an increased discriminatory
potential. Some evidence that the frequencies of
rewrite rules are less subject to intratextual variation
than the frequencies of words is discussed in Section 5.
Our conclusions are presented in Section 6.
2. Experimental Design
Our investigation makes use of material from the
Nijmegen corpus (Keulen, 1986). This corpus com-
prises a series of texts and text fragments ranging from
texts on cell biology (scientific), psychology (popular
scientific), and literary criticism to crime fiction, drama,
and on-line tennis reports, all originating in the mid-
sixties (see Table 1). Texts from this corpus have been
syntactically annotated with two different analysis sys-
tems, all texts with the CCPP system (Keulen, 1986)
and a substantial subset with the TaSCA system
(Oostdijk, 1991).
For our main experiment, we restrict ourselves to
two texts from the Nijmegen corpus, both of the same
register, crime fiction. We make this choice because of
the results of a pilot study, described in Section 2.1,
which revealed that differences in register may over-
ride differences in authorship: texts in different regis-
ters or text types by one author may differ more than
texts written by different authors in the same text type.
A positive side-effect of this restriction to the crime
fiction texts is that we can use the TaSCA annotation,
which is more detailed and which uses a more consistent
descriptive model. Section 2.2 describes the TaSCA
analyses and the form in which they were used in the
experiment. The exact setup of the authorship attribu-
tion experiment, finally, is described in Section 2.3.
2.1 Register and Authorship
It is well-known that not only differences between
authors, but also differences in register or text type are
reflected in the relative frequencies of linguistic vari-
ables, many of which are syntactic in nature (Biber,
1995). Before considering questions of authorship, we
therefore need to have some idea of the range of varia-
tion in the use of language for one author writing in
different registers, and for different authors writing in

consistent across a text. Interestingly, some gross differ-
ences in register are nicely reflected in the use of the
highest-frequency words. For instance, the drama chunks
(6, 7) cluster together in the upper left corner, the crime
fiction appears more or less in the lower left quadrant of
the plot (1, 2), and the scientific texts (3, 4, 5) appear at
the right. Importantly, Fig. 1 clearly reveals that for one
author differences in register can be much stronger than
differences within a register between texts of different
authors. The literary criticism of Stewart/Innes (3)
patterns more closely with the chunks on psychology (4,
popular scientific) and even cell biology (5, scientific)
than with his own novel (1), which is much more similar
to the other novel, written by Allingham (2).
On the other hand, the panels on the bottom row of
Fig. 1 show that when we take the third principal com-
ponent into account, the texts by Stewart/Innes (2, 3)
reveal negative scores where the other texts tend to
show up with positive scores. In fact, on PCA 3, the
chunks by Stewart/Innes and the texts by Allingham
are quite well separated. Thus there are subspaces
where the texts of one author may cluster, side by side
with subspaces where they pattern quite differently.
Figure 1 suggests that the first two dimensions, the
dimensions that account for most of the variance,
primarily capture variation in register. Scientific prose
and literary criticism appear with positive scores;
drama, tennis reports, and crime fiction, which contain
substantial amounts of direct speech, appear with nega-
tive scores on PCA 1. The biology texts and the drama
are separated from the psychology and crime fiction,
respectively by PCA 2. But after removal of this regis-
ter-bound variance, author-specific differences emerge
on PCA 3 (see Binongo (1994) for similar conclusions).
Although the third principal component separates
the two novels quite well, the question remains to what
extent this success is co-determined by the properties
of the texts from other registers that happen to be
included in the analysis. Would similar results have
been obtained if a random selection of texts from
another random set of registers had been included?
We have left this question to future research, and have
opted for a controlled experiment on authorship attri-
bution within a single rcgister.i In what follows, we will
therefore concentrate on the novels by Allingham and
Innes, both crime fiction.

the same register. Hence, we ran a pilot study on the
full range of texts available in the Nijmegen corpus, in
which we examined the relative frequencies of the
most frequent function words and their CCPP word
category codes. These texts are listed in Table 1,
together with their size in word tokens. Of special
interest for our examination is that Innes and Stewart
are one and the same person: for his fictional work,
Stewart uses the pseudonym Innes.
We divided each text into chunks of exactly 2,000
words and discarded the remaining smaller final
chunks. For each of the resulting fifty-nine chunks, we
calculated the relative sample frequency of the fifty
most frequent words in the pooled texts. Thus, each
text fragment appeared as a single observation in a
fifty-dimensional space. We used principal components
analysis' to explore the most important dimensions of
variation. Five components emerged from the analysis,
the first explaining 33.5%, the second component
9.90/0, and the third 8.6% of the variance, respectively.
The fourth and fifth principal components jointly
account for 8.4% of the variance. Figure 1 presents the
scatterplots for the first three principal components.
First consider the panel for PCA 1 and PCA 2, the
upper left-hand panel of Fig. 1. Clearly, chunks from the
same text tend to cluster. For instance, the chunks of the
text on cell biology (5, scientific) all occur at the centre
right-hand edge. This suggests that the way in which an
author exploits the most frequent function words and
their associated syntactic constructions is reasonably

(henceforth sample A) and from M. Allingham's The
Mind Readers (henceforth sample B). Both samples
have been syntactically annotated with the TOSCA
annotation scheme. In this section, we outline this
annotation scheme and the way in which we trans-
formed the annotated texts into sequences of rewrite
rules.
The syntactic annotation is exemplified in Fig. 2,
which shows the analysis assigned to the sentence He
walks his dog in the park. On each node we find labels
describing the semantic and syntactic properties of the
corresponding constituent. The label on the right in the
first line in the node represents the syntactic category,
i.e. the general nature of the constituent itself. The
label on the left in the first line represents the syntactic
function, i.e. the role the constituent plays in the imme-
diately dominating larger constituent. The labels on
second and further lines represent additional attributes
deemed interesting in the descriptive model. Consider,
for instance, the node immediately to the left of the
word park. For this node, the syntactic category is
'Noun' (N), meaning that the constituent park itself is a
noun. The syntactic function is 'Noun Phrase Head'
(NPHD), meaning that the constituent park functions as
the head of the constituent the park. The attributes for
park, finally, are 'Common' (com) and 'Singular'
(sing). A full list of all labels is given in Tables A1-A3
in the Appendix.
In order to enable the application of techniques for
words and their frequencies of use to syntactic trees it
was necessary to translate part of the information pre-
sent in each analysis tree into a pseudo-word sequence.
The question, then, is which part. We have used two
criteria to decide which information to include. The
first criterion requires selection of the most important
information. The second criterion requires the result-
ing pseudo-words to be as similar to normal words as
possible. The second criterion led us to exploit the
individual rewrites (combinations of a node and its
immediate constituents), since these are the building
blocks of the tree in the same way as words are the
Literary and Linguistic Computing, Vol. 11, No.3, 1996
building blocks of sentences. The first criterion led us
to focus first on the category label (e.g. NP), then on the
function label (e.g. su) and only last on the attribute
labels (e.g. sing) on the nodes.
For an exact choice of the information to use we
counted the number of pseudo-word tokens and types.
The total number of rewrite tokens in the two texts of
our main experiment was 46,403.3 Using only the cate-
gory labels, e.g. (for a noun phrase like the park)
NP~ DTP + N
led to 2318 types. Adding the function labels at the
right hand side, e.g.
NP~ DT:DTP + NPHD:N
increased this number to 2732. Addition of the func-
tion label on the left hand side as well,
PC:NP ~ DT:DTP + NPHD:N
raised the number to 4194. As the resulting type-token
ratio was fairly close to that for the normal words of
our samples, this is the labeling we decided to use. For
the example sentence of Fig. 2 this leads to the follow-
ing sequence of rewrites:
-:TXTU ~ UTT:S + PUNC:PM
UTT:S ~ SU:NP + V:VP + OD:NP + A:PP
SU:NP ~ NPHD:PN

2.3 Design of the Main Experiment
For our experiment, we had available the samples A
and B in normal word form (with TaSCA wordclass
tags) and in pseudo-word form as described in Section
2.2. For the evaluation of authorship attribution tech-
niques, we split the two texts into fourteen labelled
samples and six unlabelled test samples. The two
pseudo-texts were both divided into ten parts, such
that a new part was initiated at the first text unit sepa-
rator after 2,500 pseudo-words (including separators).
All parts were about the same size, except for the tenth
part of sample B, which contained only 2,254 pseudo-
words. The normal word versions were split in such a
way that they represented the same stretch of text as
the corresponding pseudo-word samples. The first
seven parts of each pseudo-text were provided as
labeled samples: AI-A7 and BI-B7. The remaining six
parts were provided as test samples: 01 (=AI0), 02
(=B10), 03 (=B8), 04 (=A8), 05 (=B9) and 06
(= A9). All correspondence information was withheld
from the experimenters.

We now have six test samples for determining the
discriminatory accuracy of authorship attribution tech-
niques. Demanding correct attribution of, for instance,
five out of six samples is not sufficient since the proba-
bility of getting at least five right by random assign-
ment is 7/64 (0.109), a value which in our opinion is too
high. In order for a technique to be found sufficiently
accurate, therefore, it must provide the correct attribu-
tion for all six test samples. The probability of getting
this result purely by chance is a mere 1/64 (0.016).
Although this is already a rather rigorous criterion, we
also wanted to ensure independence of accuracy of
assignment and our particular choice of unknown text
fragments. We therefore further required that a
successful method should in fact group all twenty
samples including the test samples into two clearly
distinguishable clusters.
The values of both D and K are primarily determined
by the high end of the frequency distribution structure.
They quantify the repeat rate of the samples.

with N the number of tokens, V(i, N) the number of
types which occur i times in a sample of N tokens, and
v the highest frequency of occurrence. Another mea-
sure was proposed by Simpson (1949), who focused on
the probability that two words randomly selected from
the text are the same. This measure is defined as
3.1 Measures ofVocabulary Richness
Various measures of vocabulary richness have recently
been applied to questions of authorship attribution
(see Holmes and Forsyth (1995) for application to the
Federalist Papers, Holmes (1992) for Mormon scrip-
ture, and Holmes and Singh (1995) for aphasic speech
patterns). These measures are of interest because,
unlike measures such as the sample mean frequency,
they are robust with respect to differences in text size.
In this study, we consider five of these measures, the
first of which was proposed by Yule (1994). It is
defined as:
3. Setting the Baseline: Word-Based Methods
The intuition underlying our approach to authorship
attribution by means of the frequencies of rewrite rules
is that the rewrite rules are a more precise clue to
authorship than the function words that have been
exploited in the seminal studies by Burrows (1992,
1993). In order to evaluate potential gains in accuracy
by changing from function words to rewrites, we need
to know the success rate of word-based authorship
attribution for the same task. We therefore carried out
two analyses, one based on measures of vocabulary
richness along the lines of Holmes and Forsyth (1995),
and one based on the fifty most frequent words follow-
ing the approach of Burrows (1992, 1993).

as in 'Yes, indeed,' Mrs Gillingham corroborated, which
occurs fourteen times in sample A. Even these simple
numbers are already indicative of the pattern that will
become apparent below: A is not as strongly focused
on the highest-frequency rewrite rules as B, and
instead shows a greater richness in the use of low-
frequency rewrites.
We translated the syntactic rewrite information in
the samples into pseudo-words. The main reason for
this was that the existing software is likely to expect
words rather than the complex (and long) expressions
that make up rewrites. For the translation, we sorted
the rewrites accordingly to their frequency (cumulative
over both samples) and named them accordingly. Thus,
the most frequent rewrite becomes W0001, the second
most frequent one W0002, etc. as shown in Table 2.
The translated rewrite rules were presented in the orig-
inal order in which they appear in the samples. In addi-
tion, text unit separators (S) were inserted to indicate
which pseudo-words together formed a pseudo-sen-
tence (i.e. which rewrites jointly form an analysis tree).
As a result, the experimenters received the following

where V(N) denotes the number of different types,
was used initially to examine the vocabulary of Latin
judicial authors. R takes into account the probability
that the author will re-use a given type in the text
rather than choosing a new one. Its dependence on
V(l, N), the number of hapax legomena, may add
useful information. Another measure that is sensitive
to the low end of the frequency distribution was pro-
posed by Sichel (1975):
S = V(2, N)/V(N). (4)
By means of this measure we take the number of dis
legomena, the words which appear twice in the text,
into account.
Finally, we examined a variable which has measured
vocabulary richness with success in various field.
Proposed by Brunet (1978), it is defined as:
W = NV(N)-a, (5)
where a is a parameter, usually fixed at 0.17, such that
W is approximately constant and independent of N.
Values for K, D, R, S, and W were calculated from the
word frequency distributions of the twenty text sam-
ples in our experiment. In this way, we obtained twenty
observations in a five-dimensional space. We used
principal components analysis to select the most rele-
vant dimensions. The analysis revealed three signifi-
cant dimensions, which explain 48.5%, 41.5%, and
9.3% of the variance, respectively. The first two dimen-
sions are shown in panel A of Fig. 3. The measures W
3.2 The Fifty Most Frequent Words
We next carried out two principal components analyses
on the individual sample relative frequencies of the
fifty most frequent function words in the pooled sam-
ples Al-7 and B1-7. In the first analysis, we considered
the frequencies of the fifty most frequent words
(excluding proper names) without considering their
word category and attribute labels. All twenty text
samples were jointly considered in the PCA. Panel B
of Fig. 3 plots all twenty samples in the plane spanned
by the first two principal components, which explain
24.3% and 12.6% of the variance. Four other principal
components emerged as explaining at least 5% of the
variance. Jointly, they accounted for 28.2% of the vari-
ance. Only the first principal component separates the
texts by A from the texts by B. This figure shows that
this raw analysis does remarkably well. Except for the
test sample 02, which is by B, but which, according to
a discriminant analysis with the labelled samples as
training samples, is equally likely to be by A or B, both
the known samples and the test samples are well sepa-
rated in two distinct clusters.
In the second analysis, homographs receiving differ-
ent word category and attribute labels in the TOSCA
analysis were analysed as different words. For instance,
and with the code CONJN ('conjunction'), and and with
the code CON ('connective') were counted as two dif-
ferent types. This approach is more in line with the
methodology of Burrows (1992, 1993), who, for exam-
ple, carefully distinguishes between subordinating that
and demonstrative that.
Panel C of Fig. 3 shows that all samples by A and B
are now well separated in the plane spanned by the
first two principal components, which account for
28.8% and 12.2% of the variance, respectively. It is the
first component that crucially distinguishes between
the two authors. The function words that are most
highly correlated with this component are listed in
Table 3. The texts by author B tend to make more use
of him and of coordination with and and but (as in the
cat AND the mouse, while author A favors but and and
as connectives (as in BUT he said that . . .), as well as the
auxiliary would. What we find, then, is that the CON
and CONJN functions of and and but should be carefully
distinguished if the required level of accuracy is to be
achieved. Note, however, that the distinction between
(r = 0.956) and R (r = -0.915) are strongly correlated
with the first dimension (PCA 1), K and D (r = -0.947
for both variables) are strongly correlated with the
second dimension (PCA 2). This figure shows that
there is a general separation of authors on the second
dimension. Nevertheless, the test samples 02 and 05,
both by B, cluster with the fragments of A, and sample
A3 patterns with B on the second dimension instead of
with A. Thus, this approach fails to meet our criteria
for accurate classification in two ways. It fails to
achieve a high accuracy for the test samples (a misclas-
sification rate of 2/6), and it fails to separate all frag-
ments adequately (a misclassification rate of 1/14). This
result seriously questions the discriminatory potential
of methods based on summary statistics of vocabulary
richness for purposes of authorship attribution.

one that does not appear in, for example, Burrows
(1992). In fact, this distinction is entirely due to the
descriptive model used in the TOSCA syntactic analy-
sis. The crucial role of this distinction in our analysis
underlines the importance of the syntactic environment
in which a function word appears. Furthermore, if the
accuracy of attribution increases by introducing more
and more syntactic distinctions into the word based
analysis, then this supports our hypothesis that it is
useful to consider the frequencies of syntactic construc-
tions directly rather than indirectly via the function
words.
4. Syntax-Based Methods
To evaluate the potential of a syntax-based approach,
we proceed as follows. In Section 4.1, we evaluate the
use of measures of vocabulary richness, but now
applied to the frequency distributions of syntactic
rewrite rules. In Section 4.2, we consider the discrimi-
natory potential of the highest-frequency rewrite rules.
Finally, in Section 4.3 we investigate how the lowest-
frequency rewrite rules can be exploited for authorship
attribution.
4.1 Measures of Vocabulary Richness for Rewrites
As before, values for K, D, R, S, and W were calcu-
lated, this time on the basis of the syntactic rewrite fre-
quency data from the twenty text samples. A principal
components analysis revealed two important dimen-
sions, of which the first explained 61.7% of the vari-
ance, and the second 21.7%. The resulting plot is
shown as panel D in Fig. 3. It is clear that a fairly good
inter-authorial separation is achieved by the two com-
ponents. Except for B7, all samples by B cluster in the
lower left corner. The samples by A appear with the
higher values on both dimensions. Examination of the
correlation structure indicates that R (r = 0.890) and K
(r = - 0.828) are almost wholly responsible for the
first principal component, while D (r = - 0.558) and S
(r = 0.523) are responsible for variation in the second.
The unknown samples are clearly within the A and. B
regions of the plot and their attributions are correct.
A and B differ most notably in their K and R values.
Most texts by A have high values of R and low values
of K, the reverse holds for the texts by B. In other
words, the samples by A are characterized by high pro-
portions of hapax legomena (R) and by a low repeat
rate (K). For B, repetition and relatively little innova-
tion are typical. The same kind of pattern appears in a
126
weakened form on the second dimension, where posi-
tive scores indicate a high proportion of dislegomena
[S = V(2,N)/V(N)] and a low repeat rate (D).
The principal components analysis is successful in
correctly classifying all the unknown samples, and
thereby satisfies our first criterion for accuracy.
However, even though all but one of the twenty sam-
ples is correctly classified, a success rate of 95%, our
second criterion is not satisfied. A different selection of
unknown text fragments might have included the mis-
classified text B7, and hence would have led to a failure
with respect to our first criterion. Nevertheless, it is
clear that we have achieved an accuracy which is con-
siderably improved compared with the corresponding
word-based analysis discussed in Section 3.1.
4.2 The Fifty Most Frequent Rewrite Rules
Are the fifty most frequent rewrite rules in the pooled
vocabulary of rewrite rules of authors A and B equally
informative as the fifty most frequent words? The
results of a principal components analysis of the rela-
tive frequencies of the fifty most frequent rewrites in
our samples are summarized in panel A of Fig. 4. It can
be seen that the samples from the second text (Bl-B7,
02, 03, 05) cluster in the upper left corner of the plot,
while the fragments by A appear to the right. While
the two components shown jointly explain 36% of the
variance, it is clear from this figure that the first princi-
pal component is the main discriminator. It is highly
correlated with the rewrite rules WOOOI (r = - 0.832)
and W0002 (r = - 0.817) listed in Table 1, as well as
with WOOlS (r = 0.826, PC:NP ~ NPHD:N) and W0013 (r
= 0.758, SUB:SUBP ~ SBHD:CONJN). Thus, it would
appear that B is using WOOOI and W0002 often, while
A is using W0013 and WOOlS more frequently. The
only fragment by A that strays in the direction of the B
cluster is A3.
Panel B of Fig. 4 shows that, according to a discrimi-
nant analysis, A3 reliably sides with the samples by A.

be the relative frequency of hapax legomena, in text j
falling in category L, with respect to the total number
of hapax legomena in j summed over all forty-nine cat-
egories. The relative frequency :Hi,j measures the extent
127
hapax legomena to the total number of tokens:
V(l,N)/N. In other words, peN) = V(l,N)/N estimates
the rate at which new units appear, the rate at which
the vocabulary of units increases. With respect to dis-
tributions of syntactic rewrite rules, this growth rate
peN) estimates the probability that an author will pro-
duce a new rewrite rule that she/he has not yet used
before. In other words, P(N) taps into an author's syn-
tactic creativity, and can be used to gauge how well an
author has mastered the possibilities offered by the
grammar.
Does peN) have a good discriminatory resolution for
authorship attribution for our experiment? Text A
appears to make a more productive use of syntax than
text B, as both YeN), the total number of different con-
struction types, and peN) are significantly higher for A
[YeN) = 2114, peN) = 0.090] than for B [yeN) = 1883,
peN) = 0.074].4
Not surprisingly, this difference in construction rich-
ness carries over to the seven known samples of A and
B. After correcting for the differences in size of the
twenty text samples, a classification tree analysis
(Breiman et al., 1984) on the basis of peN) correctly
assigns all test samples. This positive result is counter-
balanced by a rather imperfect classification of the
known samples, for which the same classification tree
reveals a misclassification rate of 2/14. Interestingly,
using YeN) instead of peN), again corrected for differ-
ences in sample size, a misclassification rate for the
known samples of 1/14 is obtained. As before, all test
samples are correctly assigned to their respective
authors. Although peN) and YeN) clearly capture
important differences between our two authors, they
are by themselves unable to satisfy the criteria we have
set ourselves, namely, to obtain a classification with a
misclassification rate of 0120.
To increase our sensitivity to author-specific differ-
ences in the use of the lowest-frequency rewrite rules, a
subclassification of the hapax legomena is required. To
do so, we sorted all rewrite rules, irrespective of their
frequency, according to their left-hand side, the infor-
mation appearing to the left of the arrow in the rewrite
rule. Some left-hand sides L appear in a great many
different rewrite rules, others appear in just a few
rules. We selected the left-hand sides with more than
ten different right-hand sides for further analysis.
There were forty-nine such left-hand sides in the
pooled twenty text fragments. Let Li(i = 1, 2, ..., 49)
denote the set of rewrite rules with the i-th left hand
side, and let hi,jU = L 2, ...,20) denote the number of
rewrite rules in text sample j belonging to set L, that
occur once only in sample j and that do not occur in
any of the other text samples (a hapax legomenon
occurring in sample f). Furthermore, let
We may therefore conclude that an analysis of the
highest-frequency rewrites satisfies both our criteria for
accurate authorship attribution: correct assignment of
all test samples, as well as a good separation of all
known samples. Note that the syntax-based analysis
does not point to the use of and and but as conjunc-
tions and connectives as the most important clues to
authorship, as emerged in the enhanced function-word
analysis. Instead, the use of verb phrases with no auxil-
iary verbs and the use of subjects realized by pronouns
emerge as primary discriminants. This suggests that the
two approaches may be complementary.
4.3 The Discriminatory Potential of the Lowest-
Frequency Rewrite Rules
The methods that we have used thus far exploit differ-
ences in the frequencies of the highest-frequency
rewrite rules, either directly, as in the analysis based on
the highest-frequency rewrites, or indirectly, via mea-
sures of the repeat rate such as D and K, which are also
influenced mainly by the higher-frequency types. In
this section, we pursue the hypothesis that robust clues
to authorship identity should also emerge on the basis
of the hapax legomena, the rewrite rules with the low-
est possible frequency of use. This hypothesis is
grounded in three considerations. First, if authors can
be distinguished on the basis of the highest-frequency
rewrites, they should also be distinguishable given the
lowest-frequency rewrites. Second, words in the high-
est frequency ranges often have properties that are
atypical for the population as a whole (see Baayen and
Sproat, 1996). Hence, it is potentially rewarding to
examine whether enhanced discriminatory power can
be obtained by turning to the lowest-frequency types.
Third, since the likelihood of storage in memory
increases with frequency of use, and since awareness
builds on memory, it is in the highest frequency ranges
that conscious and deliberate wording and syntactic
phrasing may be expected, leading to variation that is a
function of, for example, narrative development rather
than of an author's unconscious habitual use of lan-
guage. Taken jointly, these considerations, which per-
tain primarily to word usage, but which may also carry
over to the highest frequency rewrites, suggest that the
lowest frequency ranges might provide a clue to
authorship that is less contaminated by conscious
rhetorical manipulation and thematic structuring that
probably affect the higher-frequency units of analysis.
In Section 3.1, we have seen that global measures
such as Sand R are not sensitive enough for our pur-
poses. These measures, which are functions of the
numbers of dislegomena and hapax legomena respec-
tively, have been developed as characteristic 'con-
stants' that should reveal minimal variation as a
function of the sample size N. Possibly, this property of
constancy underlies their low discriminatory potential.
Hence, it is useful to consider statistics for low-fre-
quency units that are more sensitive to variations in
lexical richness.
Among the low-frequency units, the hapax legom-
ena, the units which occur once only, are of special
interest. Good (1953) has shown that the likelihood of
observing an unseen type is estimated by the ratio of

markedly from the development expected on the basis
of the urn model for word frequency distributions.
The same technique can be applied to the vocabu-
lary of rewrites. Figure 5 shows the difference between

points in 'token time' for author A (top) and author B
(bottom) using words (right) and rewrite rules (left).
Observe that the error scores are significantly larger
for words than for rewrite rules. This observation holds
not only for the absolute magnitudes. The relative size
of the error scores compared with V(k) is also signifi-
cantly larger for words than for rewrites.' What these
findings suggest is that the use of syntax is indeed more
uniform than word usage. As we expected, narrative
structure influences the non-random way in which we
use words to a much greater extent than the way
in which we use rewrite rules. This is in line with our
intuition that as we move from the relatively concrete
domain of words into the more abstract domain of
syntax, the use of elementary units becomes less
subject to conscious manipulation and thematic devel-
opment.
Note, however, that this does not imply that the use
of syntax in our texts is completely random. We still
find that for smaller sample sizes the expected number
of types is larger than the observed number of types.
And more detailed investigations reveal that there are
rewrite rules (fifteen in A, ten in B) of which it is clear
that their use is significantly (P < 0.01) concentrated in
a smaller number of fragments than expected under
chance conditions.?
Interestingly, there are also differences between
authors A and B in the developmental profile of the
error scores displayed in Fig. 5. The bottom panels (B)
reveal a semi-circular pattern both for words and for
rewrite rules. The pattern for A is far less regular,
notably for words, but also to some extent for rewrites.
The pattern for B appears to be characteristic for fairly

to which the syntactic creativity unique to a particular
author (or text sample) manifests itself in the i-th set of
rewrite rules.
A principal components analysis on the (20,49)
matrix of relative frequencies Jfi,j revealed the pattern
shown in panel C of Fig. 4. The first principal compo-
nent is highly correlated with the left-hand side UTI:S (r
= 0.96), the second principal component with the left
hand sides CJ:CL (r = - 0.66), RPDU:S (r = 0.63), RPGT:S
(r = -0.63) and V:VP (r = 0.63). All test samples are
correctly classified, and the samples by A and those by
B appear well separated by the diagonal from upper
left to lower right. This visual impression is strongly
supported by discriminant analyses. Panel D of Fig. 4
shows the separation effected by applying discriminant
analysis to the raw scores of three left-hand rewrite
sides, UTI.COORD, CJ.S, and RPDU.S, which are already
sufficient to distinguish between the samples by A and
those by B. Many other (small) subsets of left-hand
sides can be found that also separate the two authors
quite well, including the rewrite sets singled out by the
principal components analysis. Similar separation of
the two authors can be achieved by applying discrimi-
nant analysis to the PCA scores. Interestingly, this is
the only principal components analysis where we found
that standardization (that is, using the correlation
matrix instead of the covariance matrix) did not lead to
improved results. This suggests that this technique,
which satisfies our two criteria for accurate authorship
attribution (correct assignment of test samples, and
overall classification accuracy) is more robust than the
techniques that exploit the highest-frequency rewrite
rules.
5. Variability in Word Usage and the Use of
Syntax
Our experiment suggests that syntactic annotation pro-
vides excellent clues for authorship attribution, and
that measures focusing on syntactic creativity are espe-
cially promising. But why do analyses that are increas-
ingly sensitive to syntactic differences lead to more
accurate results? First, as we have hypothesized above,
by focusing on syntax we are tapping into the more
abstract, largely unconscious and hence most revealing
habits of our authors. Second, the use of syntactic rules
might be subject to intra-textual variation to a lesser
extent than the use of words. This would tie in with our
first explanation: as a textual property becomes more
abstract and less directly manipulable, it is more likely
to be uniformly (randomly) distributed. And if it is
more uniformly distributed, it is a more reliable clue
for authorship attribution.
The hypothesis of the more uniform use of syntax
can be tested by making use of a technique developed
in Baayen (1996). It is a well-known property of word
frequency distributions that the expected vocabulary
size calculated for the initial M tokens of a text may
differ substantially from the observed vocabulary
size V(M). Baayen shows that narrative structure and
thematic organization and the concomitant non-
uniform use of key words in novels give rise to a devel-
opment of the vocabulary size that may differ

straightforward narrative development, while the pat-
tern observed for A suggests a more complex narrative
structure (see Baayen, 1996). Although the effects of
narrative structure cannot be eliminated by turning
from words to syntax, it nevertheless appears to be the
case that syntax-based analyses are less likely to be
foiled by idiosyncrasies of particular parts of the text
than analyses based on word usage.
6. Discussion
Our investigation has revealed a consistent pattern in
the differences between the authors A and B. A has a
greater vocabulary size than B, both with respect to
words and with respect to syntactic constructions.
Similarly, A makes more use of morphologically com-
plex words than B,7 and finally, narrative development
in A appears to be more complex than in B. Across the
board, A reveals a more creative use of the possibilities
of English. Since A (Stewart/Innes) is a literary critic
as well as a writer of crime fiction, this difference
comes as no surprise. It is this difference that has
enabled us to tease apart text samples written by Innes
from text samples written by B (Allingham).
However, in the current study, the discovery of such
a consistent pattern of differences is of secondary
importance. After all, this is basically a methodological
study, and the focus has been on how the differences
between authors are best observed. To this end, we
have compared traditional word-based methods with
syntax-based methods. An increase in classification
accuracy could be observed for the more syntactically
aware methods. We interpret this result as confirming
our initial intuition that the use of function words for
classification purposes is an economical way of tapping
into the use of syntax, but that the direct examination
of the frequencies of syntactic constructions leads to a
higher discriminatory resolution. This hypothesis
received explicit support from an additional analysis
demonstrating that the use of rewrite rules is less vari-
able within texts than the use of words. This indicates
that more robust results may be expected with syntax-
based methods than with word-based methods. In
addition, both the high-frequency head of the rewrite
frequency distribution as well as its low-frequency tail
provide independent converging evidence for author-
ship, thus confirming the reliability of the syntactic
approach.
Our analyses have furthermore revealed that meth-
ods based on the frequencies of large numbers of
types, either high-frequency types or the lowest fre-
quency types, are substantially more accurate than
methods based on summary statistics of vocabulary
richness. The latter methods pick up the main trends,
but they fail in that they give rise to higher misclassifi-
cation rates.
Since all this means that the proposed syntax-based
methods need an advanced level of annotation, we are
faced with the question how these methods can be used
in actual authorship attribution practice. With the gen-
eral lack of syntactically annotated text material, it is
unlikely that the works in question are available in
such an annotated form. An optimistic solution would
Literary and Linguistic Computing, Vol. 11, No.3, 1996
be to mark exactly those properties which our experi-
ment shows to have high discriminatory value, e.g.
coordination at utterance level (urr:COORD). It is very
likely, however, that the most discriminatory proper-
ties will vary with the author pair (or group). Until
more research has shown that there is indeed a specific
set of highly discriminatory properties, it is safest to
annotate the texts as extensively as possible" and let
the statistical techniques select what is most interest-
ing. Such annotation will generally entail substantial
time investment," but it does lead to an increase in clas-
sificatory accuracy.
Apart from the advantages of syntax-based methods
our analyses have also shown the need for closer exam-
ination of the relative importance of register-specific
and author-specific variation. Our exploratory pilot
study revealed that register variation masks author-
specific variation on the most important principal com-
ponents. Nevertheless, after register variation has been
partialed out, author-specific variation emerges with
surprising clarity. Evidently, more systematic investiga-
tion of author-specific variation against the back-
ground of register variation is extremely promising for
cross-register authorship attribution. In the light of the
overall success of our experiment, syntactically anno-
tated multi-register corpora such as those used by
Biber (1995) in his studies of register variation are
especially promising as frames of reference for ques-
tions of inter-register authorship attribution.
Notes
1. Unless stated otherwise, all principal components analyses
made us of standardized scores (i.e. analysed the correla-
tion structure instead of the covariance structure). In
almost all our analyses, standardization led to greatly
improved classifications.
2. The attribution task in this experiment is obviously much
simpler than in the case that a large number of texts from
many different authors written over a large number of
years have to be compared. We cannot guarantee that
techniques that yield accurate results in this experiment
will also be useful in more complex cases. We may, how-
ever, expect that techniques that are inaccurate even for
the present simple case will not be accurate either for
more complex cases. Furthermore, it seems plausible that
techniques that prove to be more accurate for simple cases
might also prove to be more accurate for complex ones.
3. Note that the number of rewrites (46,403) is 4% smaller
than the number of tokens (48,477), including punctua-
tion), but 16% larger than the number of words (39,866,
no punctuation). This means that the sample sizes in the
experiment will vary with type of data used. The number
of rewrites is equal to the number of non-leaf nodes in the
analysis trees. In a descriptive model which uses consis-
tent binary branching, the number of rewrites would be
equal to the number of tokens minus the number of trees.
However, in the TOSCA model, which allows multiple
branching as well as single branching, the number of
rewrites cannot be expressed as a simple function of the
number of tokens. Multiple branching decreases the num-
ber of rewrites, whereas single branching increases the
number of rewrites. These two effects appear to balance
out for our texts, where 48,477 tokens in 3688 sentences
lead to an expected number of 44,789 rewrites for binary
branching. The actual number, 46,403, is only 4% higher.

two-sided proportions test with continuity correction). In
line with results reported in Baayen (1994), especially the
use of adverbial -ly appears to be a good discriminant,
leading to an overall misclassification rate of only 1/20.
8. A variable here, obviously, is the annotation scheme to be
used for this. We have shown the TaSCA scheme to yield
good results, even without the use of the attribute labels
(any readers wishing to apply this scheme should contact
Hans van Halteren). We expect other schemes (as long as
they are fairly detailed) to do as well, although the differ-
ences in annotation may lead to shifts in the most discrim-
inatory properties. It is not possible to compare text
properties if the texts have not all been annotated in the
same scheme.
9. We are not very optimistic about the use of fully automatic
parsers, but follow-up research should not disregard this
possibility.
