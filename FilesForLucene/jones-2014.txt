Back translation: an emerging sophisticated cyber strategy to
subvert advances in ‘digital age’ plagiarism detection and
prevention
Michael Jones* and Lynnaire Sheridan

Wollongong, Wollongong, Australia
Advances have been made in detecting and deterring the student plagiarism that
has accompanied the uptake and development of the internet. Many authors from
the late 1990s onwards grappled with plagiarism in the digital age, presenting arti-
cles that were provoking and established the foundation for strategies to address
cyber plagiarism, including software such as TurnitinTM. In the spirit of its prede-
cessors, this article presents a new, less-detectable method of cyber-facilitated pla-
giarism known as ‘back translation’, where students are running text through
language translation software to disguise the original source. This paper discusses
how this plagiarism strategy attempts to subvert academic attempts to detect
plagiarism and maintain academic integrity in the digital age, before presenting
useful detection tools and then critiquing three classroom plagiarism management
approaches for their usefulness in the current digital and educational context.
Keywords: plagiarism; assessment design; academic integrity; back translation;
student equity
Why has plagiarism flourished in the digital age?
The concept of plagiarism is not a modern phenomenon. It has been practiced for as
long as the art of writing itself has. Shakespeare seems to have misappropriated text
as others have misappropriated from him (Julius 1998; Thomas 2000). Writers such
as Newton, Leibniz and Calculus have also been accused of plagiarism (Heather
2010). Writers and poets in sixteenth century England were lamenting their loss of
ownership as the rights to their work passed from author to agent upon completion
(Sutherland-Smith 2010). This began a bevy of copyright suits and laws until owner-
ship of text became more certain in the mid-eighteenth century (Park 2003).
The term plagiarism derives from the Latin plagiarus meaning ‘kidnapper’
(Walker 1998). This was built into English law in 1710 where the product of the
author was regarded as the author’s ‘child’. In misappropriating an author’s text, the
offender was seen as kidnapping the words and ideas from the originator
(Sutherland-Smith 2010).
The nature of plagiarism has changed since the arrival of the digital age. Plagia-
rism was once a difficult and time-consuming enterprise which tended to focus on
acquiring material from print-based sources (Carroll 2002; Lea and Jones 2010).
This misappropriation of text required real effort and its poor return on investment

promoted greater honesty (Ellery 2008). Now, armed with an abundance of
electronic journals and literary information on the internet (Bennett 2005), it is only
too easy for honest and dishonest students alike to find, copy and paste relevant text
into their own academic submissions (Simon et al. 2004).
Today, we are dealing with what Barbrook (2002) labels the ‘Napster generation’
(279). To put this into perspective, if students feel no qualms in downloading
(or pirating) movies and music, and not seeing legal and cultural deterrents to the
practice, what imperatives are in place for them to treat text any differently? Culwin
(2006) and Mirow and Shore (1997) found that, through the process of cutting and
pasting from the web and changing a word here or there, students assume ownership
and originality for the text they have borrowed. While this research is now quite old
– given the current generation of web-savvy students – it is still relevant in regard to
student beliefs of ownership. Other research finds that students consider that copying
from the internet is less dishonest than taking text from books; that the internet is a
free zone, where copying is permitted; and that copying from the internet is harder
to detect (Flowerdew and Li 2007).
To add to the increasingly liberal environments which are nurturing plagiarism,
we now have internet sites where students can procure cheap papers or where they
can be custom written to order (Bennett 2005; McKeever 2006; Selwyn 2008). Stu-
dents can take information from blogs (Selwyn 2008) or can scan print material with
hand-held scanners (Underwood and Szabo 2003). ‘The range of dishonest practice
is limited only by students’ abilities to use technology creatively’ (Underwood and
Szabo 2003, 470).
The effect of these increased opportunities for cheating not only diminishes stu-
dent academic labour; they also impact on student equity, and reduce reading, think-
ing, reflection, creativity and originality (Bennett 2005; Ellery 2008). Equity is a
particularly problematic issue. When honest students discover they are competing
with students who cheat, they feel compelled themselves to plagiarise to maintain a
level playing field (Underwood and Szabo 2003; Park 2004; Lancaster and Culwin
2007; Sutherland-Smith 2010).
On the other side of this issue, the educators who enforce academic integrity are
becoming increasingly reluctant to punish and intervene (Sharman and Wilshire
2007). This stems from several reasons, among them the increased workload
involved in detection and conviction; the stress and unpleasantness of pursuing a
charge of plagiarism (de Jager and Brown 2010); the ethical dilemma based on the
university’s position as a provider of education, not as distributer of punishment
(Ashworth, Bannister, and Thorne 1997); the economic pressure on academics to
maintain pass levels and enrolment numbers; and the lack of bite within universities
who maintain a rhetoric of ‘plagiarise and be punished’ but who are reluctant to fol-
low through on their convictions usually due to a highly risk-averse position
(Bennett 2005; Sharman and Wilshire 2007).
Student plagiarism is not only a problem that affects a large proportion of stu-
dents, the problem is also growing: ‘There is mounting evidence that student
cheating in general, and plagiarism in particular, are becoming more common and
more widespread’ (Park 2003, 471). Research by McCabe, Trevino and
Butterfield (2001), which looks at the growth in plagiarism over a period of
30 years, found that student plagiarism is becoming increasingly problematic,
leading Hart and Friesner (2004, 89) to find that: ‘plagiarism may now be a seri-
ous and endemic problem’. The British newspaper The Telegraph reported that

‘More than 17,000 incidents of [serious] cheating were recorded by universities
in the 2009–2010 academic year’; this represents an increase in 50% over four
years (Barrett 2011).
Re-visiting papers such as Austin and Brown’s (1999) article specifically exam-
ining internet plagiarism and Duggan’s (2006) editorial overview of plagiarism
issues (emerging from a UK conference titled Prevention, Practice and Policy) in
this same journal and subsequent discussions, it is clear that many of the issues they
discussed continue to emerge in articles on plagiarism today but, in many aspects,
there have been some advances and new strategies have been developed to combat
internet-facilitated plagiarism, such as TurnitinTM software. This said, in discovering
the phenomenon of back translation, it is clear that it is important to keep on top of
emerging plagiarism and examine how students attempt to subvert the digital plagia-
rism prevention strategies that, increasingly, have been put in place from the early
2000s onwards. This discussion also provides an opportunity to see how evolving
strategies, such as cross-language plagiarism detection software, might come to the
fore in the coming years.
Back translation a new ‘cyber-based’ form of plagiarism
The usual method by which students plagiarise is for the student to copy a section
of text, from a journal article for instance. They then paste this into their own work,
asserting that the completed collage of blended writing is their own authentic crea-
tion. The degree of plagiarism that might apply, in cases such as this, differs accord-
ing to the proportion of text which has been ‘borrowed’, by the amount of
‘paraphrasing’ or word altering that has occurred, and by the degree of referencing
the student has included acknowledging original ownership.
Discovering this common form of plagiarism is reasonably simple. However, it
is not foolproof. Students usually leave signposts and indicators which draw the
examiner’s attention. These indicators include: inconsistencies in style; font;
sentence structure; dates of sources or material within the text; spelling styles
(American and English); and students’ writing abilities (Carroll 2002). Students’
argument can be off subject, referring to aspects which digress from the desired
objective or do not address the requirements of the assessment. Harris (2001) finds
that the structure and density of the sentences within the student’s work may also
reveal the likelihood of plagiarism: the greater the variation in sentence length, the
more probable it is that plagiarism has occurred. He states that:
Software analysis of student essays shows that college freshmen usually have an aver-
age sentence length of about 15 to 17 words…As writers improve, sentence structures
tend to grow more complex and hence sentence lengths increase. (Note that there are
exceptions such as business prose and journalese, which set short sentences as a goal.)
Generally, however, if the sentences of an entire paper or a section of a paper are
unusually long you may want to give the paper a second look for other clues to copy-
ing. Finally, if the sentences vary in average length by paragraph, that is also cause for
concern. (69–70)
A more recent development in techniques for student plagiarism – especially for
those attending English-speaking institutions from non-English-speaking back-
grounds – is to make use of the advanced technologies now available on the internet
to translate the text they cut-and-paste in the hope that their cheating will be
completely disguised. With tools such as Babelfish or Google, students can easily

convert the English language text that they have copied to a different language
(Spanish for example) and then retranslate these converted words back into English.
An example of how this works can be seen below. In this example a very famous
passage of text taken from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (2004) has been selected. The
authors then translated this text into Spanish through Babelfish (http://babelfish.
yahoo.com/):
English Original:
I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its
creed: ‘We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal.’ (1)
Spanish Translation:
Tengo un sueño que un día esta nación se alzará y vivirá hacia fuera el significado ver-
dadero de su credo: ‘Llevamos a cabo estas verdades para ser evidentes en sí, ese todos
los hombres somos equal.’ creados;
Retranslation into English:
I am a sleepy that a day this nation will raise itself and live outside towards the true
meaning of its creed: ‘We carry out these truths to be evident in himself, those all the
men we are equal’. Created;
It is clear from this illustration, since we are reasonably familiar with the original
text from Dr. King, that this translation is flawed and somewhat preposterous. How-
ever, while we may argue its legibility, it would be hard to accuse this student of
plagiarism. The text does not look like it has been copied. Instead it looks poorly
written, and perhaps poorly understood.
If, however, we took a less notable segment of text and translated it similarly,
we would find that the text becomes more difficult to spot for plagiarism and for
fidelity. This is illustrated in the following passage taken from Williams (2005):
English Original:
While many universities around the world would probably claim that their publicly sta-
ted policies and procedures will act as a deterrent to any student contemplating plagia-
rism, their publication alone is unlikely to cut any sway with would-be plagiarists. In
North America, however, the punitive systems in place to discredit plagiarists tend to
be an integral part of university-wide honour codes that, effectively implemented, can
make students think long and hard about engaging in plagiarism. These university
‘honour codes’ have a long history, and they are treated very seriously by the authori-
ties. (8)
Spanish Translation:
Mientras que muchas universidades en todo el mundo demandarían probablemente que
sus políticas y procedimientos público indicados actuarán como impedimento a cualqu-
ier estudiante que comtempla plagio, su publicación solamente es poco probable cortar
cualquier sacudimiento con los plagiarios supuestos. En Norteamérica, sin embargo,
los sistemas punitivos en el lugar para desacreditar a plagiarios tienden a ser una parte
integrante de los códigos universidad-anchos del honor que, aplicados con eficacia,
pueden hacer que los estudiantes piensan largo y duro en el acoplamiento a plagio. Es-
tos códigos del honor del `de la universidad tienen una larga historia, y son tratados
muy seriamente por las autoridades.

comtempla plagiarism, its publication is only little probable to cut any shaking with
the supposed plagiarists. In North America, nevertheless, the punitive systems in the
place to discredit plagiarists tend to be an integral part of the university-wide codes of
the honor that, applied with effectiveness, can do that the students think length and it
last in the connection to plagiarism. These codes of the honor of `of the university have

English Retranslation (after applying a spellchecker – including grammar):
Whereas many universities anywhere in the world would demand probably that their
indicated policies and procedures public will act like impediment to any student who
contemplate plagiarism, its publication is only little probable to cut any shaking with
the supposed plagiarists. In North America, nevertheless, the punitive systems in the
place to discredit plagiarists tend to be an integral part of the university-wide codes of
the honour that, applied with effectiveness, can do that the students think length and it
last in the connection to plagiarism. These codes of the honour of the university have
one long history, and are treated very seriously by the authorities.
A student who has submitted a passage similar to that would be seen as having poor
English language skills, and the passage or paper would be dismissed accordingly. It
is also likely that the person marking the essay will expend time and energy correct-
ing this student’s grammar. It is unlikely the examiner would assume that the pas-
sage was entirely plagiarised, with little, if any, student input – which is entirely the
case here.
Given the likelihood that students in an increasingly internationalised tertiary
education setting may trade on their poor English skills as a reason for the paper’s
lack of coherence, and that examiners may likewise consider that poor writing qual-
ity has resulted from the writer’s poor grasp of the language, detection of plagiarism
in such cases is not as simple as it is for more typical forms of plagiarism.
Back translation subverts existing plagiarism prevention
Back in 1999, Austin and Brown suggested that papers could be evaluated for digi-
tal plagiarism via general sight evaluation (analysis of writing style), then suspicious
texts could be further investigated using digital technology ranging from searching
the sources that might have been used by students through to starting to use the then
emerging plagiarism detection software. We will now demonstrate how back transla-
tion has subverted initial detection as well as the advanced plagiarism detection soft-
ware that is now in common use.
Back translation impedes analysis of writing style
Even in approaches to detected off-line plagiarism, instinctual or formal analysis of
writing style has proved useful to tertiary educators. As argued above, one of the
key strategies of back translation is to confuse the reader by disguising plagiarism as
a language competency issue. With increasing numbers of international English as a
Second Language (ESL) students attending English-speaking institutions (Coughlan
2011; Hurst 2013), there has never been a better time perhaps to use this ruse.
Back translation thwarts TurnitinTM
A common tool employed for the detection of plagiarism, a targeted response to the
misuse of digital content, is TurnitinTM (turnitin.com). This tool provides a

content-matching function to rate student papers on their proportion of originality.
When TurnitinTM was compared with manual detection of plagiarism, the average
examiner missed four of five occurrences of plagiarism which were subsequently
identified by TurnitinTM (Jocoy and DiBase 2006). This, and similar findings, have
inspired the uptake of automated plagiarism detection software in academic institu-
tions worldwide.
The increasing use of automated plagiarism detection means that students who
engage in deliberate plagiarism have had to develop new strategies to make their
plagiarism difficult to detect. A study of first-year business students by Koshy
(2008) found that students would deliberately misspell words when submitting docu-
ments to TurnitinTM to avoid text-matching detection. Eleven per cent of her partici-
pants agreed with the statement ‘It is more important to avoid text matching than
plagiarism’ (Koshy 2008, 8).
The emergence of back translation is yet another response to students’ under-
standing that current software is designed to match text used in assessments word
for word with external sources. Back translation subverts detection software by
changing the words but keeping the essence of the concept. It cleverly conceals the
source as detectable elements of the original text are literally ‘lost in translation’.
Furthermore, when back translation is used by students from an ESL background,
grammatical errors are expected and somewhat permissible thus adding to the sub-
terfuge. The challenge then often becomes ‘certifying the absence of plagiarism’, as
(Evans 2006, 87) describes it.
Existing and emergent strategies to detect back translation
By acknowledging the existence of back translation, rather than perceiving it as an
English language issue, it is possible (even with existing tools and technologies) to
detect it via proactive analysis of writing style and observing the development of
writing. In the future, evolving cross-language tools may lead to a TurnitinTM
multilanguage equivalent or yet more sophisticated tools to detect plagiarism includ-
ing the use of back translation. Each of these strategies will now be explained.
Analysis of writing style
Proactive analysis of writing style can include deliberate collection of student-
writing samples as a point of reference for future assessable work or using intrinsic
analysis software.
Sampling writing styles
While the most basic approach to writing style analysis may be considered low-tech
and old fashioned, in 1999, Carnevale proposed the collection of samples of a stu-
dent’s natural writing style for future comparison with subsequently submitted
assessments to detect plagiarism. This is still pertinent today to back-translation.
As back-translation might appear to be simply poor writing, the concept of col-
lecting samples of a student’s writing at the beginning of a course does seem to be a
useful way to develop a point of reference for confirming or dismissing plagiarism
in assessments where back-translation has been used, as a student’s actual abilities
can be compared with the assessment language and style.

If this approach was adopted, the written sample of work could be spontaneously
announced and collected in class. It could be a non-assessable piece of work with
loose time limits, perhaps summarising the first few weeks of class’ topics. The doc-
ument would contain the student’s natural grammatical style and language level as
there would be no opportunity for external input or back-translation. It would be an
authentic piece of work with which to compare future assessment tasks.
This said, comparing style manually and within a group assignment setting
would still be time consuming, but if treated as a reference for benchmarking ques-
tionable student submissions, it would be viable.
Intrinsic analysis software
Most automated plagiarism detection software (including TurnitinTM) currently uses
extrinsic analysis, that is, ‘finding near-matches to a text in a database of texts’
(Stamatatos and Koppel 2011, 2). The alternative is intrinsic detection. This method
focuses on writing style, and strives to determine whether the text was generated by
multiple authors, rather than the single student author who is claiming the work is
authentic (Stamatatos and Koppel 2011).
For detection, Carnivale (1999) referred to software designed to determine the
authentic authorship of work based on writing style so, potentially, labour-intensive
manual comparisons of written documents may not be necessary. Maurer and Zaka
(2007) refer to a similar software tool called Cloze. Traditionally, the term ‘cloze’ is
associated with language comprehension activities that require students to fill in
blanks in a text using words that satisfactorily complete the meaning. In this case,
the student’s original work is turned into a cloze passage text with every fifth word
removed before requiring the same student to fill back in the missing words. This
can test whether the student produced the work, because according to Maurer and
Zaka (2007)
it has been proven through hundreds of experiments that a person that has written the
document will fill in words more than 80% correctly, while persons who have not writ-
ten the text will not manage more than some 50% correct fill-ins at most! (2).
Whether it would be appropriate to apply such a Cloze test to all students, or just
suspicious cases, is not clear in terms of its labour intensiveness and perceptions of
equity or victimisation.
Observation of text development
Austin and Brown (1999) suggested that students’ exhibit writing to teachers as it
develops; today, the authors propose that a less labour intensive and intrusive
method is now possible. Might the use of the tracking elements of wikis, for exam-
ple, aid in plagiarism detection both in single and multiple student-authored assess-
ments?
Wikis
Weingarten and Frost (2011, 52) explain that ‘wikis add a dimension of
meta-analysis to the activity: on most wiki platforms, contributions and edits are
logged, so that the history of the process that produced the text can be retraced and

examined’. The authors propose that the use of wikis for student assessment devel-
opment might illustrate examples of cutting or pasting into the document as well as
whole paragraphs of poorly written materials (potentially back-translated) suddenly
appearing in blocks. When a document does not appear to be being written, but
instead, pasted in chunks, further evidence of originality could be requested from
the student.
Also, back-translation in group work may become identifiable. Currently, it is
possible that an unsuspecting group member might edit out flaws in back-translated
text by correcting back-translated text, which was simply perceived as work of poor
quality, in the production of a polished final draft of an assessment. A wiki would
monitor the arrival and editing of that text into the assessment. How labour-intensive
wiki monitoring might be is unclear.
Cross-language plagiarism detection software
To match student ingenuity, there have also been further technological advances
in the development of tools much more closely aligned with attacking the
cross-language element of back translation. Beyond tools designed for English,
cross-language plagiarism detection is a growing area of research fundamentally
focused on how to compare documents across different languages (Ceska, Toman,
and Jezek 2008, 83).
Ceska, Toman and Jezek (2008, 84) developed a software model designed to
detect plagiarism across languages even where some words were replaced in the
final plagiarised text with synonyms. They achieved this by creating a multilingual
database of words which could match synonyms across European languages; text
matching could then take place independent of the language. It was important to
‘choose such features that can be employed in most of languages regardless of the
grammatical rules they apply’ (Ceska, Toman, and Jezek 2008, 86). Using Czech
and English as a starting point, they found that their model across languages had no
negative impact on the accuracy of plagiarism detection.
These sophisticated models may hold the key to detecting multilingual plagia-
rism including back-translation, but, as at 2011, ‘cross-language plagiarism is an
important direction of plagiarism detection research but is still in its infancy’
(Potthast et al. 2011, 59). It is important to note that the cross-language software has
not been specifically targeted to address back-translation. In many cases, it has
emerged as a response to a debate in translation literature where there are concerns
about whole pieces of work being translated into a new language with no acknowl-
edgement of the original author of the work. Whilst there is also some discussion of
‘translation plagiarism’, defined by Kent and Salim (2009) as ‘translation of a sen-
tence in the source language in the way that ends up using almost the exact same
words as the original source used by the original author’ (Kent and Salim 2009, 39),
this is still quite different from our back-translation scenario where the text is ‘laun-
dered’ through internet translation software rather than being an unintentional trans-
lation back to the original language. Back-translation, however, obviously stands to
benefit from this technology.
While these ideas have been proffered, overall, back-translation and its detection
are rarely touched on in the literature, thus much more empirical research needs to
be undertaken on this plagiarism strategy and its potential detection.

Philosophical approaches to classroom management of plagiarism
Accepting that back-translation exists, the authors consider it important to re-visit
the overarching approaches to classroom-level plagiarism management and their rel-
evance to the current educational and digital context.
It is acknowledged that plagiarism needs to be institutionally managed, as part of
sustaining academic integrity, and that classroom educators do not control the entire
framework from policy to punishment. If preventing plagiarism is the creation of ‘an
environment where, regardless of the motivation, the chances of detection and pun-
ishment are uncomfortably high’ (Williams 2005, 8), individual classroom teachers
actually cannot prevent plagiarism. Instead, it is presented here that they can choose
to work with plagiarism (embrace it), deter it or avoid it.
Embrace plagiarism: legalise it for learning purposes
This takes a ‘legalise’ rather than ‘criminalise’ approach and has emerged very much
as a response to the digital environment and its current real-world use. Jones (2009)
refers to increasing calls for academics to embrace a new world where copying of
text is not considered plagiarism. Her commentary was based on the book ‘Free Cul-
ture’ by Lessig, who does believe in acknowledgement that facilitates rather than
inhibits creativity, advancement and, by default, learning (Lessig 2004).
Whilst the authors are not comfortable to endorse a carte blanche approach, it is
understood that if plagiarism became an authorised student activity, it could be used
specifically to achieve student-learning goals.
Deter plagiarism: teach morality and garner good academic conduct
Philosophically, deterring plagiarism is ‘the creation of a (perhaps, Utopian) envi-
ronment where students never feel motivated to plagiarise’ (Williams 2005, 8). Edu-
cating students on issues associated with academic integrity, including plagiarism,
and engaging them in the process of establishing codes of conduct or abiding by an
institution’s honour code is purported as a means of creating such an environment
(Jones 2009). Ideally, it creates a student culture that will not tolerate plagiarism
and, where this fails, punishment of offenders is severe acting as a deterrent to
others (Williams 2005).
The premise for this approach is that, while many strategies can be put into place
to maintain academic integrity striving to rule out plagiarism, there may always be
new ways to cheat: ‘Trust and student honesty thus remain central to a successful
academic system’ (Evans 2006, 87). This is a proactive approach aimed at broadly
supporting academic integrity that remains relevant today.
Avoid plagiarism: design it out
Good assessment design has long been considered a stalwart in plagiarism preven-
tion. While myriads of assessment design techniques exist in the academic literature,
we would like to present a higher level classification of the key approaches and their
current relevance, particularly in light of back translation:
(1) Supervise: As plagiarism fundamentally cannot occur in an examination set-
ting, a shift in assessment from written assignments to examinations would

prevent plagiarism (Carnevale 1999; Jones 2009). Although this would hold
true for back-translation, it is often not a practical option.
(2) Personalise: Davis (2011) suggests the personalisation of assignments. This
means that the task relies upon the student’s personal experience or perhaps
data or information which is provided by the lecturer or generated by the
students in an earlier phase of the work. The nature of the assessment means
that it cannot be copied year to year or downloaded from any external
sources. Sterngold (2004) similarly suggests that the assignment could be
based on a guest lecturer or a site visit, again, unique events that preclude
plagiarism.
(3) Change: Alter (slightly or extensively) assessment tasks for each student
cohort to ensure that submission of an earlier piece of work for the same
course would not meet the current assessment criteria (Harris 2001).
(4) Restrict: Provide students with a limited list of academic sources that they
can use to complete the assessment task, so only these may be used and
cited. As the sources are well known to the teacher, students will understand
that copying is futile (Harris 2001).
(5) Create: Focus assessment tasks on activities that are not usefully supported
by plagiarism. Austin and Brown (1999) suggested that having students cre-
ate rather than write would prevent plagiarism. The following assessment
task provides an example of this technique: ‘You are the founder of the
world’s first iron-ore plant on the moon. Explain the five most important
steps you would put in place to ensure a safe working environment, and
explain each in detail’. In this task, the students must create their own logi-
cal work rules, and in so doing will contrive arguments to support these
ideas.
(6) Formative: Addressing one root cause of plagiarism, Sterngold (2004) sug-
gested that assessments be divided into portions rather than larger tasks. His
rationale is that last-minute time pressures associated with large assessments
are conducive to plagiarism. By helping students to manage their time and
breaking down tasks, and assessing these formatively, the reliance on plagia-
rism may be reduced.
Reflecting on all the recommendations of the digital plagiarism combatants of the
late 1990s and early 2000s, and considering today’s context, assessment design
based upon techniques presented above has – in contrast to other strategies –
remained relevant despite the enormous digital change in the last decade.
Conclusion
The emergence of back translation as a sophisticated cyber strategy demonstrates an
attempt by some students to subvert advances in ‘digital age’ plagiarism detection
and prevention. This paper has discussed strategies that will work to detect back
translation but has also taken a look at classroom plagiarism management.
For plagiarism to be eradicated, if that was ever possible, approaches based on:
embracing a culture of free thought; creating a moral student culture with honour
codes; and good assessment design that avoids plagiarism altogether may need to be
part of a comprehensive multipronged strategy. In acknowledging this, planning
assessments with a view to designing out plagiarism will perhaps have the greatest

potency towards countering back-translation, as an emerging form of plagiarism,
and thus gives classroom academics a pragmatic strategy for dealing with it on a
day-to-day basis, particularly as tools like Turnitin begin to show cracks and are no
longer a deterrent to all students.
Indeed, as we move into what some are calling the post-digital age, ‘The state of
being in which you assume the digital instead of marvelling at it’ (http://nextberlin.
eu/2012/01/what-is-post-digital/), we suspect that designing out plagiarism via good
assessment design will continue to stand steady while many other aspects of educa-
tion change in light of continuing global change in the digital space.
