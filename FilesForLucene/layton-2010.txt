Abstract—Authorship attribution is a growing field, moving
from beginnings in linguistics to recent advances in text mining.
Through this change came an increase in the capability of
authorship attribution methods both in their accuracy and
the ability to consider more difficult problems. Research into
authorship attribution in the 19𝑡ℎ century considered it difficult
to determine the authorship of a document of fewer than 1000
words. By the 1990s this values had decreased to less than
500 words and in the early 21𝑠𝑡 century it was considered
possible to determine the authorship of a document in 250
words. The need for this ever decreasing limit is exemplified
by the trend towards many shorter communications rather than
fewer longer communications, such as the move from traditional
multi-page handwritten letters to shorter, more focused emails.
This trend has also been shown in online crime, where many
attacks such as phishing or bullying are performed using very
concise language. Cybercrime messages have long been hosted on
Internet Relay Chats (IRCs) which have allowed members to hide
behind screen names and connect anonymously. More recently,
Twitter and other short message based web services have been
used as a hosting ground for online crimes. This paper presents
some evaluations of current techniques and identifies some new
preprocessing methods that can be used to enable authorship
to be determined at rates significantly better than chance for
documents of 140 characters or less, a format popularised by
the micro-blogging website Twitter1. We show that the SCAP
methodology performs extremely well on twitter messages and
even with restrictions on the types of information allowed, such
as the recipient of directed messages, still perform significantly
higher than chance. Further to this, we show that 120 tweets per
user is an important threshold, at which point adding more tweets
per user gives a small but non-significant increase in accuracy.
I. INTRODUCTION
The Internet has typically facilitated shorter forms of com-
munication more easily than traditionally longer forms such as
handwritten letters and essays. One example of a shorter form
of communication online is Internet Relay Chat (IRC) rooms,
which provides a text based ‘chatting’ service, where users
post short messages to a ‘chatroom’ which is then readable
by all users in this chatroom. A typical message in IRC is
very short and it is common for individual messages to be
a single sentence or less. Twitter has surged in popularity in
recent years and now reports that it receives over 50 million
messages (called tweets) per day [34]. Twitter is a micro-
blogging website and allows users to post messages with
1Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/
the restriction that posts must be 140 characters or less in
length. Another social network based website, Facebook2 has
many different forms of communication between users such
as instant messaging, internal messages and wall posts, with
most of these forms of focusing on shorter messages. Many
other websites include comments sections, such as YouTube3
and blogs, which are typically focused on shorter messages.
There is a clear trend overall towards shorter messages on
the Internet, which is also shown in other technologies, where
short message services (SMS) have become a very popular use
of mobile phones.
This trend of shorter online messages is also seen in cyber-
crime where crimes such as phishing and cyberscams usually
occur with shorter messages such as fraudulent emails [27],
forum posts [2], underground IRC rooms [33], on Facebook
and Twitter, as well as many other websites [1]. Cybercrim-
inals attempt to use these websites and web services to gain
information that can lead to identity theft or identity fraud [1].
Internet based chat rooms and forums have been known to be a
tool used by cybercriminals to sell stolen identity information;
sell and buy malware and botnet access; and, also to trade in
illegal pornography and copyrighted materials [2]. Cybercrime
is a growing area of crime and has been recognised as a
priority by many governments, such as the Australian Federal
Government[10].
As law enforcement agencies (LEAs) attempt to track down
and monitor cybercriminals using these technologies, it is
becoming increasingly important to determine the authorship
of a message as technologies such as fast flux make it
increasingly difficult to track down offenders using network
based tools[13]. Accurate authorship attribution of such shorter
messages help LEAs to prosecute these criminals [9]. Illegal
resources have been shared on Internet forums for many
years with very little description and some criminals write
about their crimes under anonymous authorship either to gain
notoriety or to profit from their crimes [2]. To be able to track
and determine the authorship of these messages would provide
a large leap in the ability of LEAs to prosecute criminals based
on Internet postings.

It is widely considered in the literature that people exhibit
particular trends in their writing which in turn reveals facts
about them, such as their age, gender and personality traits
[4]. An example of a stylistic marker is the use of ‘txting’
shorthand such as 2nite4 and the use of emoticons such
as :-) [6]. It has been shown repeatedly in the literature
that determining the particular author from a set of candidate
authors is possible by looking at the documents that each
author has written and matching a new document of unknown
origin to a profile built of each author [14], [23], [26], [29],
[32], [35]. This process is known as authorship attribution and
is part of the field of authorship analysis which includes author
profiling [4], similarity detection [22] and authorship intent
determination [17].
Authorship attribution has its roots in stylometry, before
much of the work in the field moved to simple statistical
analysis [28]. With the exponential increase in computing
power, the 20𝑡ℎ century saw a drastic rise in the complexity
of the statistical analysis of documents and also a gradual
shift towards machine learning methods [31]. By the 21𝑠𝑡
century, a majority of the work in authorship analysis is
now performed using complex statistical analysis that would
not have been computationally feasible just 50 years earlier
[18]. This increase in complexity also saw a decrease in the
required length of a document to achieve good accuracies in
classification. As an example, 19𝑡ℎ century authorship studies
considered blocks of 1000 words to be a lower limit on the size
of a block of text to analyse [25], and that even larger blocks
were needed to removing accidental irregularities in writing
style. By the 1990s 250 words, a quarter of the previous
limit, was considered a limitation on the length of a document
that could be attributed accurately [11], however more recent
work has been able to break this barrier and achieve reliable
authorship attribution in 250 word documents [3].
The reduction in the length of a document required has
increased the scope of available applications. Where as early
work in authorship attribution focused on documents of longer
length such as the Federalist papers [28], more recent work is
able to look to online documents such as blog posts [26] and
at even shorter length forum postings [2]. The shorter required
length has increased the viability of authorship attribution
in an important area of online activity, cybercrime related
documents.
The work presented here is closely related to an area
of text mining called ‘chat mining’ [19], in which Internet
based discussions are mined for certain information such as
authorship. This area is motivated strongly, as this research
is, by investigations into cybercrime [24] due to the need for
information to help LEAs to conduct and prosecute offenders
online, where direct attribution of attacks is often obfuscated
using online anonymity tools such as the use of proxies or
botnets.

A. Research Questions
In the presented research, we extend the field of authorship
analysis towards determining the authorship to one of the
shortest forms of communication currently in use - a tweet.
A tweet is the name given to a post from the website Twitter,
which is an example of a micro-blogging website in which
users post messages about whatever topic they wish, but are
limited in the number of characters they can use for a single
tweet. This limit is 140 characters for Twitter, which is the
limit used in this research. We are motivated by the continued
use of shorter messages in cybercrime and aim to determine
the viability of authorship analysis on these shorter messages
in order to help investigations into these crimes. To those
goals, this research aims to answer the following questions:
1) How effective is an existing leading authorship attribu-
tion technique (SCAP) at attributing tweets to a given
author?
2) What properties of tweets enable or prohibit effective
authorship attribution in tweets with respect to a cyber-
crime investigation?
3) Does splitting individual author’s authorship profiles into
a set of sub-profiles provide a significant benefit over
using a ‘complete’ author profile?
4) How many tweets per author are needed for an accurate
profile of an author is there a threshold in which in-
creasing the number of tweets provide a non-significant
accuracy gain?
The rest of this paper will follow this outline. The next section
will provide an overview of Local 𝑛-grams and the SCAP
methodology, which is one of the current leading methods
in authorship analysis on structured text. The methodology
that was used for the experiments will then be presented in
section III, followed by the results from those experiments in
section IV. The outcomes from those results will be discussed
in section V along with the conclusions which will outline the
contributions made in this paper in detail.
II. LOCAL 𝑛-GRAMS
Modern authorship analysis typically uses machine learning
algorithms to investigate multiple variables and their rela-
tionships to the authorship of the documents in the training
corpus. This type of learning closely follows other machine
learning methods, such as a classification framework for
authorship attribution [15] or a data clustering framework
for similarity detection [21]. Differences to many other data
mining applications are usually in the first stages of the data
mining process, such as feature extraction from the text of
the document [35], document preprocessing methods [20] and
specific distance metrics [16]. These differences relate directly
to the method of calculating the distance or similarity between
two documents in the corpus. This is necessary as authorship
analysis is performed on text documents and many machine
learning algorithms deal specifically with numbers and vectors.
Once distance is able to be measured between documents, this
limit is overcome and a large range of data mining methods,
2
such as classification or clustering algorithms, are able to be
used to generate models of the data.
Using character level 𝑛-grams to develop author profiles
has proven to be a successful method of translating a corpus
of documents into a set of models for authors [16]. Once
the models are generated as 𝑛-gram distributions, the best
matching author is decided by finding the nearest profile,
calculated using a distance metric that accounts for the 𝐿
most frequent 𝑛-grams in a document and the frequency with
which they occur. These frequency lists are compared on the
assumption that documents written by the same author use the
same 𝑛-grams with a similar overall frequency. This work is
an extension of a previously derived method [7] which was,
at least computationally, ahead of its time. The results in [16]
are significantly above chance rates, with many experiments
achieving results above 80% authorship attribution accuracy
and all experiments outperforming previous results on the
same authorship attribution problems.
The use of 𝑛-grams for authorship attribution was furthered
in work by [12], which removed the complex distance metric
in [16], replacing it with a simple set intersection based metric.
The distance between a document and an author’s profile is
the size of the intersection between the set of the top 𝐿 most
frequently occurring 𝑛-grams for the document and profile.
The Simplified Profile Intersection (SPI) was shown to be
an effective distance metric for evaluating the authorship of
the source code of computer programs, a highly structured
form of written document. SPI either outperformed or equalled
the relative distance (RD) given in [16] in all of the given
experiments and is shown to be more robust than the RD when
the profile size (𝐿) increases for smaller values of 𝑛.
SPI is used as part of the Source Code Authorship Profile
(SCAP) methodology [12], which proceeds as following:
1) Divide the known corpus into training and testing doc-
uments
2) For each author:
a) Concatenate all training documents per author into
a single document
b) Calculate the top 𝐿 most frequent 𝑛-grams for the
combined document
c) This list is the Simplified Profile for this author
3) Each testing document is assigned to the profile with the
largest SPI similarity
To determine the best guess for attribution of testing docu-
ments, each testing document is profiled as a list of the 𝐿
most frequently occurring 𝑛-grams. To calculate the similarity,
the normalised size of the intersection of each user’s profile
and the testing document’s 𝑛-gram list is used, the user profile
with the highest similarity is declared the best match for the
given document.
III. METHODOLOGY
This research presents an exploratory look into authorship
attribution of tweets, aiming to investigate the viability of
authorship attribution on these shorter messages. Using a col-
lection of tweets collected from publicly available feeds (see
subsection III-A) the SCAP method will be applied directly to
the raw text of the messages. Other information, such the date
a tweet is posted, will not be used while the author of a tweet
will be used for the classification class only. All usernames
are assumed to be for a single author, although this is not
verified in the dataset collection. The accuracy will be tested
as described in subsection III-B and then an investigation of
the attributes of tweets relating to the semi-structured nature of
tweets will be performed, described in subsection III-C. Once
this has been performed, the impact of using sub-profiles will
be investigated as outlined in subsection III-D. Finally, the
impact of the number of tweets on the accuracy of SCAP will
be in investigated using the methodology outlined in section
III-E for both profiles and sub-profiles.
A. Tweet Dataset
The tweet dataset used is a collection of 14,000 Twitter users
and their most recent tweets as of February 20105. The most
recent 200 tweets for each user were collected. The users were
collected by searching twitter for a random function word from
the list in [35] and collecting the usernames of each tweet that
was returned by Twitter’s search engine. This list of returned
values is the most recent tweets posted to Twitter containing
the search term.
Function words were search for over 4 days in regular 15
minute intervals, collecting over 56,000 usernames, of which
14,000 were selected at random for the dataset. For each of
those usernames up to a maximum of 200 hundred tweets.
The dataset contains the username, date and contents for each
tweet, although the date is not used in these experiments. Only
publicly available tweets were collected and any user with
a private profile would not have been returned in the initial
search and was therefore excluded from this dataset.
B. Applying SCAP
To determine the viability of performing authorship attri-
bution on tweets, a preliminary experiment was performed
where the SCAP methodology was applied directly onto the
tweets dataset outlined in section III-A. This experiment
aims to answer the first research question of this research;
how effective is an existing authorship attribution technique
(SCAP) at attributing tweets to a given author? For the test,
50 authors were selected at random from the dataset described
in subsection III-A and their tweets comprise the sample used,
giving an average chance rate accuracy of approximately 2%.
Ten fold cross validation was used for dividing the corpus
into training and testing documents The tweets were divided
into ten random sub-samples over the entire sample and are
therefore not normalised for author balance.
The SCAP method takes two parameters, the values for 𝐿
and 𝑛. Values of 𝐿 were selected by searching a wide range
of values and narrowing searches around interesting values.
Values for 𝑛 were selected to be between 2 and 7 as this is
comparable to values found in the literature [22]. The better
5A copy of the dataset can be obtained by contacting the authors.
3
values were determined by finding the highest mean values
and testing if they are significantly better than other values
for the parameters.
C. Structural Investigation
Tweets are a semi-structured form of text and while the
structures are entirely optional, they are used regularly. There
are two main types of structure in tweets [8], which are:
∙ @replies: To direct a message at a user with a given
username, include @username in the tweet
∙ #tag: To give a message a tag, which can be used for
searching and grouping similar messages across different
people, include #tagname in the tweet
To investigate the impact of these structures on the accuracy
of the system, an experiment was run that removes most of
the information in these structures, in order to answer the
second research question; what properties of tweets enable or
prohibit effective authorship attribution in tweets with respect
to a cybercrime investigation? It could be reasonably expected
that in some cybercrime settings, a cybercriminal posting
anonymously would be careful not to reply to regular contacts
or apply their normal tagging to their tweets. For this reason,
it is important to consider how effective authorship attribution
can be when this information is not included.
Another reason to consider tweets without this information
is the lack of authorship choice in using these structures. To
direct a tweet at the user with username example user123,
the tweet will include @example_user123. The decision
to use a directed reply is a decision made by the user, but
15 of the characters in the structure (the username) were
used without any authorship decisions by the author of the
tweet. For a 140 character tweet, there is a large portion of
the message that the user did not actually ‘author’. A similar
problem occurs with the tagging syntax, where tag names can
also account for over 10% of the message in some case. This
could have an effect on the overall accuracy of the SCAP
method which would be uncovered through this experiment.
To determine the impact of these parts of the message
on the overall accuracy of the profile based method, three
preprocessors were used that perform the following actions:
∙ At preprocessor: Replace all instances of @username
with @
∙ Hash preprocessor: Replace #tag with #
∙ Both preprocessor: Both At and Hash applied
These preprocessors aim to remove some of these extra clues
that could be contained in tweets. For instances, by convers-
ing with different people, the @username structure could
contain more information about the choices a user’s friends
make about their Twitter username. These choices could be
related to demographic information and convey information
that could help the authorship analysis process. The difference
in accuracy after applying these preprocessors determines the
importance of this information in enabling or prohibiting
authorship attribution in tweets.
D. Sub-profiles
The SCAP methodology, described in section II, works
by finding a profile of an author that is ideally dense, in
that documents by the same author are very similar to each
other. Additionally, author profiles should be well separated
from other profiles as ideally documents by different authors
are less similar than each other. A set of profiles with this
characteristic is likely to accurately classify future instances,
as they will be classified to their nearest author. A measure of
how well data is formed in this way is the silhouette coefficient
[30] which is typically used in unsupervised learning. The
silhouette coefficient is near 1.0 for dense, well separated
clusters and near -1.0 for clusters that heavily overlap and is
defined for each individual point (an overall score is calculated
by taking the mean for each point in a dataset). The silhouette
coefficient for profile 𝑝, where 𝑎𝑝 is the mean distance between
all documents in 𝑝 and 𝑏𝑝 is the mean pairwise distance to the
nearest profile of another author, is defined in equation 1. The
Silhouette Coefficient for a set of profiles is simply the mean
of the silhouette coefficients for each profile within the set.
𝑠𝑝 =
𝑏𝑝 − 𝑎𝑝
𝑚𝑎𝑥(𝑎𝑝, 𝑏𝑝)
(1)
To evaluate the quality of the profiles, the silhouette co-
efficient will be used to evaluate the profiles by measuring
the internal profile distance compared to the distance between
profiles. Profiles with a poor silhouette coefficient may be
composed of separate ‘sub-profiles’, clusters within the profile
of similar instances. These sub-profiles may have a high
silhouette coefficient if considered separate from the other sub-
profiles for a given user. If this is found to be the case then the
accuracy of the overall system should improve, as the profiles
and sub-profiles would have a higher silhouette coefficient
and therefore a better chance at accurately classifying future
documents.
To calculate sub-profiles, the 𝑘-means clustering algorithm
is run for two clusters and the silhouette coefficient is calcu-
lated for the resulting sub-profiles within the authors profile.
The mean intra-sub-profile distance (𝑎), is compared against
the mean distance between the two sub-profiles (𝑏) and the
mean silhouette coefficient for the author’s sub-profile is
calculated. A positive silhouette coefficient implies that the
two sub-profiles are distinct and they are used to profile the
author. If the resulting silhouette coefficient is negative or zero,
then there is some overlap between the sub-profiles. The sub-
profiles are discarded and the author is profiled using a single
profile only.
To compensate for the randomness of the results obtained
by the 𝑘-means algorithm, the 𝑘-means++ seeding algorithm
was used, as was a number of trials for the sub-profiling
of each author. The 𝑘-means++ seeding algorithm [5] was
used to seed the initial clustering for the 𝑘-means algorithm.
While the seeding from 𝑘-means++ reduces the need for a
large number of trial runs, there is still an element of chance
in arriving at the best partition, even with just two clusters.
To compensate for this, 30 number iterations of 𝑘-means are
4
performed with randomised starting values for each user and
the highest silhouette coefficient is used, given that it is a
positive value.
The use of sub-profiles will be evaluated using the same
process as described for the preliminary SCAP application in
section III-B. Profiles will be generated for each author and
then each profile will be tested to see if a number of sub-
profiles can more accurately describe the user’s writing style.
Once the sub-profiles have been generated, testing instances
are classified according to the closest profile or sub-profile
and the accuracy of the system will then be evaluated using
10 fold cross validation.
E. Restricting the number of tweets
To answer the final research question, the number of tweets
per author will be reduced to determine the impact of this
number on the final accuracy. The SCAP methodology on
the twitter dataset with no preprocessors will be used for this
experiment. Values between 20 and 200 will be used in steps
of 20, to account for the range up to the 200 tweets per user
limit that was available in the original dataset. A consistent
reduction is expected in the overall accuracy after applying the
SCAP methodology as above using 10 fold cross validation.
Further to this expectation, a 𝑡-test will be performed to
determine whether adding more tweets significantly increases
the accuracy. This test determines whether there is a critical
threshold for the number of tweets that should be met, before
adding tweets is less effective overall.
IV. RESULTS
A. Benchmark SCAP Accuracy
To answer the first research question posed in subsection
I-A, in the first experiment the SCAP methodology is applied
directly to a sample of tweets from the collected dataset. The
SCAP methodology was applied as outlined in subsection
III-B and the results are listed here. The parameters to the
SCAP methodology provide the largest issue, as two param-
eters must be searched. Results given in [12] suggest that
the parameter space is probably smooth but non-linear. For
this reason, a wide range of values were searched for 𝐿 and
ranges near interesting values were searched in more detail.
For the values for 𝑛, previous results in [22] indicate that
values between 2 and 7 inclusive should be sufficient to gain
effective results, particularly for English-tending datasets such
as the one used here6.
A preliminary search on values for 𝐿 showed little dif-
ference between 𝐿 values, which is considered due to the
size of the individual tweets. This result is unsurprising when
comparing using values of 𝐿 between 200 and 3000, as
reported in [12], which is well above the 140 character limit
for an individual tweet. A search for 𝐿 values less than 200
returned no significant differences in the resulting authorship
profiles, as diversity within an author is not significant. For
6The dataset is primarily English due to the use of English function words
in the search, however there are other languages present in the dataset.

this reason, all 𝑛-grams are included, so 𝐿 can be considered
as any value more than the maximum number of distinct 𝑛-
grams for any author.
Values for 𝑛 were searched between 2 and 7 inclusive and
at this point the scores achieved were progressively lowering.
Table I show the overall mean and standard deviation of the
cross fold validation performed using SCAP for each value
of 𝑛. This highest mean is for 𝑛 = 4, and is significantly
different than 𝑛 = 5 (difference of 0.01, 𝑝-value of 0.267)
but not significantly different than 𝑛 = 3 (difference of 0.021
and 0.021 as the 𝑝-value7). Overall, this accuracy of 0.729 is
significantly higher than the chance rate of 0.02 and a high
benchmark for future experiments.
B. Structural Clues
The results of the SCAP method after applying each of
the three preprocessors (At, Hash and Both) are presented
in table II. The results after applying Both preprocessors
were on average 27% less accurate than their corresponding
‘raw’ results (without applying the preprocessor). For the
At and Hash preprocessors the reduction was 26% and 1%
respectively. This indicates that the tags applied to tweets do
not contain much authorship information, while the replies
contain quite a bit of information which is likely due to
other users that an author frequently converses with. The
network of other users that a given user converses with are
therefore important clues for determining the authorship of
tweets and removing these clues poses a significant decline
in the accuracy of the SCAP methodology. Even without the
network of people a user converses with, an accuracy of over

0.555 was still achieved, significantly higher than chance rates
for the 50 users in each test.
C. Sub-profiles
The results for the benchmark experiments showed a good
deal of inter-author separation. Analysis of the twitter users
with the silhouette coefficient [30] is given in table III and
indicates that the ratio between authors is similar to the ratio
within a given author’s profile. This indicates that the profiles,
while distinct enough to achieve the high results found in
the benchmark experiments, still have some ambiguity in the
boundaries between one user and another. Further to that, it
shows that having values of 𝑛 too high overfits the data, as
higher 𝑛 values lead to more distinct clusterings but not to
higher accuracies as tested in subsections I and II. For this
reason, it is important not to use the silhouette coefficients
alone to justify the selection of a value for 𝑘, rather to test
that the increase is significant over the smaller values.
The results after applying sub-profiling are given in table
IV. Two clusters were chosen for each user using the above
procedure There is a small but non-significant increase for
most methods and values of 𝑛. Upon observation, there are
two reasons that could cause this. The first is that each of the
sub-profiles is generated using a lesser number of tweets than
the full profile, which could be a factor in the overall accuracy.
Secondly, the silhouette coefficients listed in table III are high,
suggesting that sub-profiling is separating already dense author
profiles.

D. Restricting the number of tweets
To answer the final research question, the number of tweets
per author was limited to quantity between 20 and 200 inclu-
sive, in steps of 20 tweets. The results of the accuracy, after
applying SCAP on the tweets without any preprocessing, are
given in table V. It can be shown that the accuracy increases
with an increasing number of tweets, with the exception of 120
tweets per user. This increase over 140 tweets is not significant
and also marks the lowest values where this is not the case.
For less than 120 tweets, adding another 20 tweets increases
the accuracy a significant amount, using a two tailed t-test
against the null hypothesis that 𝑘 tweets is not significantly
different in accuracy than 𝑘 − 20 tweets.
V. CONCLUSIONS AND CONTRIBUTIONS
Four questions were posed for this research and the list of
experiments has given answers to each along with a number
of contributions. These are summarised below.
Firstly, the SCAP method is very accurate at determining
the author for a given tweet. The accuracy of over 70% for 𝑛
values of 3, 4, 5 and 6 is significantly higher than the chance
rate of 2% for the 50 authors in the sample used. This indicates
that authorship of twitter messages is indeed possible at a
much higher than chance rate, which is the first contribution
of this work.
Secondly, up to 27% of this accuracy is lost when removing
information about the users that a given author converses with
through @replies. While #tags contain some information, it
appears that there is a lot of information contained specifically
in the @replies for tweets. The observation that the network

of communication of a particular author is very important in
determining authorship is the second contribution of this paper.
Thirdly, creating sub-profiles of each author was shown to
give a small but insignificant increase in the accuracy of the
methodology, presenting the third contribution of this paper. It
is possible that other methods may perform better, especially
given the simple nature of the splitting used in this research.
Finally, it was shown that approximately 120 tweets per user
is an important threshold for determining authorship. After
this, increases in the accuracy for an additional 20 tweets are
not significant. While ‘more tweets are better’ in all cases,
significant increases can be made by just adding a small
number of tweets below this threshold. This threshold is the
final contribution of this paper, giving a guideline to future
studies in this area.
With the above contributions from this work, it has been
shown conclusively that authorship is possible for twitter
messages at significantly higher than chance rates. Importantly,
there are a few areas in which this accuracy might be improved
further. Some of these possibilities are discussed in the next
subsection.
A. Future Work
It was shown in this research that including the full
usernames of the other Twitter users that are @replied to
has a higher accuracy than removing this information. This
information was removed due to the motivation behind this
research; in a cybercrime setting, it is safe to assume that
a person trying to be anonymous would not converse with
their normal circle of friends. However in other settings, or
in a situation where the cybercriminal is part of a known
network of users collectively communicating, this assumption
may not be needed and instead this communication network
information could be leveraged to compliment the 𝑛-gram
profiling performed in this work. A combination of authorship
analysis above with a network analysis on the other users that
a given user converses with could show a drastic improvement
in overall accuracy.
The authors hypothesise that the main reason for the high
accuracy for the raw dataset is based in the sampling method
7
used for selecting authors. Given that the authors were ran-
domly selected, there is a low probability that any two authors
converse with the same groups of people or even any particular
person. If one author converses with @fred often while another
user converses with @JANE, then the first author will have
a high frequency of the tri-gram (𝑛-gram with 𝑛 = 3)
@fr while the second author will have a high frequency of
@JA. A future study in this area could perform a ‘crawl-
based’ collection approach, where a single user is selected,
then their communication network is collected, continuing
outwards. This sampling technique could pose a more difficult
problem, as there would be more authors conversing with
@fred, reducing the impact of the @fr trigram.
Another possible avenue for future work is the application
of these techniques into other short messages, such as IRC
logs, instant messaging, blog comments and Facebook status
updates. All of these areas have issues with types of cyber-
crime, such as spam, defamation and harassment.
Finally, the sub-profiling method shown in this work was
very simple, as a profile was split into exactly two sub-profiles
using the 𝑘-means algorithm. An improvement method of
splitting the profile could generate better sub-profiling which
could again lead to a higher classification accuracy. Together
with the other suggested improvements, there is significant
scope for more research in this area.
