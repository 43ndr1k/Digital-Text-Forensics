Abstract. Author profiling is the task of determining the age, 
gender or type of the author's personality by studying their 
sociolect aspect, that is, how the language is shared by people. This 
paper presents the COMSATS Institute of Information 
Technology, Lahore entry for the PAN 2015 competition on 
Author Profiling task. Our proposed system is based on stylometry 
features. We implemented 29 different stylistic features, many of 
which are language independent. Since the training data was 
available in multiple languages, one of our main objectives was to 
explore which language independent features are most effective. 
The problem of author profiling was casted as a supervised 
document classification task. Results showed that features 
(Percentage of Question Sentences, Average Sentence Length, 
Percentage of Punctuations, Percentage of Comma and Percentage 
of Full stops) were most effective multilingual features. 
 
1 Introduction 
  
Personality in Encyclopedia of Psychology is defined as “individual differences 
in characteristic patterns of thinking, feeling and behaving.” [1]These 
differences can be reflected through one’s speech, writing, images etc. 
Authorship analysis deals to find out the methods to identify these differences 
and use them to know profile of author such as gender, age, native language, 
education, profession or personality type. So author profiling can simply be 
defined as: given the set of texts, you need to identify age, gender, profession, 
education, native language and similar personality traits.  
Authorship analysis has attracted much attention in recent years due to the rapid 
increase of electronic text and the need for expert systems able to handle this 
information. Like from a marketing viewpoint, companies may be interested in 
knowing about the trends regarding their products, on the basis of the analysis 
of blogs and online product reviews, what types of people like or dislike their 
products, what is required by the customer and which customer category/ class 
they can attract more. Similarly from a forensic viewpoint, determining the 
linguistic profile of a person i.e. who wrote a "suspicious text"’ may provide 
valuable background information. 
In this paper we explore how different stylistic features help in conveying about 
the personality of writer. Moreover, we also tried to find out how the use of 
different stylistic features affect multilingual results. We used the datasets 
provided by PAN organizers, and applied different machine learning practices 
for predicting writer’s traits. 
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes related work. 
Section 3 presents the approach used to identify personality traits of author. 
Section 4 describes the results obtained on training data. Section 5 presents the 
results obtained on test data and section 6 concludes the paper. 
 
2 Related work 
 
With the advancement in web technology, there is an abundant increase in use 
of electronic media. Along with useful information there is also heap of 
anonymous data available so the need to identify “who is who” has become 
important. 
A lot of establishments have been done in this field so far, Pennebaker et al. [2] 
joined dialect utilization with identity qualities, examining how the variety of 
semantic attributes in a content can give data in regards to the gender and age 
of its author. 
Argamon et al. [3] analyzed formal written texts extracted from the British 
National Corpus [4] combining function words with part-of-speech features. 
Koppel studied the problem of automatically determining an author’s gender 
by proposing combinations of simple lexical and syntactic features. 
Holmes and Meyerhoff [5], Burger and Henderson [6] have also investigated 
obtaining age and gender information from formal texts. 
Seifeddine and Maher [6], focus is on author’s discussions, they combine 
content based approach and statistic approach. They show a hemi- strategy that 
[4] www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk 
 
merges the analysis of information in writings with a machine learning 
technique. To get a higher organization of these statistics, they depended on the 
utilization of the “Decision table calculation". 
 
3 Our approach 
 
3.1 Stylistic Features 
The approaches commonly used for the automatic identification of an author’s 
personality traits from text can be categorized into three broad categories: (1) 
Stylometry based approaches (which aim to identify an author’s traits from his 
writing style), (2) Content based approaches (which identify author traits using 
features extracted from the content of the document) and (3) Topic based 
approaches (which try to predict an author’s profile based on the topics used in 
the document). The system presented in this PAN Author Profiling Competition 
is based on stylometry. 
Table 3.1 shows the list of 29 stylistic features used for the development of our 
proposed author profiling detection system. As can be noted that these features 
aim to extract different stylistic information from a single document, which can 
be helpful in identifying the age, gender, personality type i.e. stable, open, 
extroverted, agreeable and conscientious .In this year’s training data, the tweets 
are available for four different languages: (1) English, (2) Dutch, (3) Spanish 
and (4) Italian. This study aims to identify some language independent stylistic 
features which are probable to perform on multiple languages as well. As can 
be noted from Table 3.1 that features numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 20, 
21, 23 and 24 are language independent and can be used for extracting stylistic 
information from document in any of the four languages i.e. English, Dutch, 
Spanish and Italian, while the remaining ones can only be used for English 
language.

profiling detection system. 
3.2 PAN 2015 Author Profiling Training Datasets  
Our proposed system was trained using the PAN 2015 Author Profiling training 
data, which consists of Twitter tweets in four different languages: (1) English, 
(2) Dutch, (3) Spanish and (4) Italian. In the training dataset there are 152, 34, 
100 and 38 author profiles for English, Dutch, Spanish and Italian languages 
respectively.  
In the PAN 2015 Author Profiling training dataset, there are two classes for 
gender (male and female), four classes for age (18-24, 25-34, 35-49 and 50-xx) 
for the remaining personality traits open, stable, agreeable, extroverted and 
conscientious there are two classes: (yes or no).  
 
3.3 Evaluation Methodology 
The task of identifying an author’s profile from text was treated as a supervised 
machine learning problem. N-fold-cross-validation was used. Due to difference 
in the sizes of training data for different languages, we used 5-fold cross 
                                                                                                     Languages

validation for English language corpus, 4-fold cross validation for Dutch and 
3-fold cross validation for the Italian and Spanish corpora respectively. 
We applied a range of machine learning algorithms on the training data 
including Navies Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, J48 and 
Logistics. The WEKA’s (give reference) implementation of these algorithms 
was used. The scores generated using the stylistic features (see Table 3.1) were 
used as “input features” to the machine learning algorithms.  
We used WEKA’s “attribute selection” approach for selecting “best features” 
from the complete feature set. For that purpose we explored CFsSubSetEval, 
Filtered Attribute, SVM Attribute and Classifier Subset as evaluators, and Best 
first and ranker as search methods.  
  
3.4 Evaluation measure 
As recommended by PAN 2015 organizers, the performance of the proposed 
system for age and gender personality traits was measured using accuracy, 
whereas for other personality traits (stable, open, extroverted, agreeable and 
conscientious) average Root Mean Squared Error was used.  
 
4 Results on Training Data 
 
We carried out three sets of experiments: (1) performance on individual 
features, (2) performance on combined features (mean all 29 features are used 
as input) and (3) performance on “selected features”. The best performance was 
obtained using “selected features”, therefore, we are only reporting the results 
for them.  
Table 4.1 demonstrates the accuracy for age and gender trait and average root 
mean square error for personality types, for tweets in all four languages. Best 
features for age and gender traits in English, gender, stable, agreeable and 
extroverted traits in Dutch, age, gender and extroverted traits in Spanish and 
gender and extroverted traits in Italian are obtained by using “ranker” search 
method while remaining are obtained through “best-first” search method, the 
features chosen by these methods are shown in table 4.2 
 
 
Table 4.1 shows the results for training data on all four language, for age and gender accuracy 
scores are reported, while for other personality traits average root mean square error scores 
are presented. 
 
Table 4.2 shows the features selected for training data on all for language 
 
5 Results on Test Data  
 
Table 5.1 shows the accuracy for age and gender trait and average root mean 
square error for personality types, for test data in all four languages i.e. (1) 
English (2) Dutch (3) Spanish (4) Italian. For evaluation of test data we train 
our modal using all features as discussed in table 3.1., and applying “chi 
squared” evaluator and “ranker” search method. It can be concluded from 
table 5.1 that overall high accuracy for age and gender is achieved for English 
language, while for other traits i.e. open, stable, agreeable, extroverted and 
conscientious overall best results are achieved for Dutch language.

6 Conclusion 
 
In this paper we have discussed our participation in the Author Profiling task. 
We have covered the role of stylistic features in identification of author 
personality traits. For that purpose we figured out 29 features and perform 
different experiments on these, like comparing accuracy by using all features, 
then checking accuracy for single feature and finally using subsets of them 
and come to conclusion that best results are achieved by feature selection 
techniques.
