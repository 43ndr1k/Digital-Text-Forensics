Abstract
Imitative texts of high quality are of some importance to students of
attribution, especially those who use computational methods. The authorship
of such texts is always likely to be difficult to demonstrate. In some cases, the
identity of the author is a question of interest to literary scholars. Even when
that is not so, students of attribution face a challenge. If we cannot distinguish
between original and imitation in such cases, we must always concede that
an imitator may have been at work. Shamela (1741) has always been regarded
as a brilliant parody. When it is subjected to our standard common-words
tests of authorship, it yields mixed results. A new procedure, in which special
word-lists are established according to a predetermined set of rules, proves
more effective. It needs, however, to be tried in other cases.
..................................................................................................................................
1 The Problem
The question, as posed above, is a mere flourish. Shamela (1741) was
published anonymously, one of many parodies of the first volume of
Samuel Richardson’s Pamela, which had appeared in the previous year.
Henry Fielding never acknowledged it as his, and his authorship has
sometimes been disputed. But it was an open secret in his own days and
the modern scholarly consensus leaves no genuine room for doubt.
Behind the flourish, nevertheless, lies a genuine question. Are our
computational tests of authorship able to identify the author of an
imitative text? The matter embraces serious imitations, where the intent
is to deceive, as well as parodies, where the intent is to satirize. Texts
revised or extended by a second author stand at the edge of the same
territory. In all these cases, the identification of the real author can be
of intrinsic scholarly interest. Even when, as with Shamela, that is not
so, the question of our capacity remains. Unless we can identify the
true authors of such works, every identification we offer is open to the
objection that an imitator may have been at work. Shamela makes an
appropriate point of entry into this whole area because it has always
been recognized for its parodic brilliance. It is no surprise to find that
it does, in fact, offer a stern challenge to several current tests of

authorship. But a rather different kind of test, with which I have lately
been experimenting, assigns it unambiguously to Henry Fielding.
2 The Texts
In order to test these matters more thoroughly, I have turned away
from the large set of ‘histories’ on which much of my computational
work on prose fiction has been based for many years. These
retrospective narratives, couched in the first person, provided an
unusually homogeneous set of specimens, relatively free of the sharp
stylistic contrasts that obtain between third-person narrative and
dialogue. But, as a compensation for the loss of this stylistic
homogeneity, the new set of texts to be used here ranges further
across the works of Fielding and Richardson, and their more immediate
contemporaries. In keeping with the recent practice, which makes it
easier for others to replicate one’s procedures, the new set of
texts is substantially unmodified. Two sorts of alteration should be
mentioned—ancillary matter, like chapter titles and page numbers,
was enclosed in angle brackets to exclude it from the word-counts
and single quotation marks were converted to doubles in order to
distinguish them from apostrophes.
Table 1 lists the new datasets for Fielding and Richardson. In each
case, there is a main body of about a hundred thousand words for use
as a procedural basis and a further range of independent test specimens.
(A similar division obtains for the texts of other authors, which will be
set out later in this article.)1 The main sets are designed to represent
each author’s prose fiction. They also include a single specimen apiece
of their non-fiction. Fieldimg’s Essay on Conversation is a discursive
piece. Richardson’s Familiar Letters is a set of model letters for use in
many social situations such as the dismissal of an employee or the
rejection of a proposal of marriage.
Of the test specimens, Fielding’s range widely across his prose works
including some essays, and his personal letters. (These last are distinct
from his Familiar Letters, which, unlike Richardson’s, are from a work
of prose fiction. They are five letters contributed by him to his sister
Sarah’s Familiar Letters between the Characters in ‘David Simple’.) The
Richardson test specimens are chosen on a different basis. In order
to focus on comparing Shamela with Fielding’s particular target,
they comprise successive 20,000-word segments from the first volume
of Pamela. Whether or not Shamela can be seen as more broadly
Richardsonian is a further point of interest.
3 The Evidence of Very Common Words
This broader question is an appropriate place to begin because it can
easily be accommodated in another process, that of ensuring that
the two main sets can be distinguished on authorial lines. Each of
the main sets was split, for this initial purpose, into ten segments

of 10,000 words. In the event, the main distinction offered no difficulty.
But, as to Shamela, the results of these first comparisons were mixed.
The outcome of several cluster analyses seemed mutually contra-
dictory. In every trial, there was a sharp and accurate separation
between the entries for Fielding and those for Richardson. But,
in different trials, Shamela shifted from one camp to the other. The
variation, it emerged, was governed by the length of the word-list.
The shorter the list, the more Shamela resembled Richardson. With
longer lists, it moved into Fielding’s territory. This pattern deserved to

be kept in mind because it might reflect the increasing proportion
of lexical words in longer word-lists. And that, in turn, might imply
that Fielding captured more of Richardson’s syntax and major
rhetorical habits than of his vocabulary at large.
Principal component analysis has the advantage of cluster analysis
in admitting more than a single perspective. On its horizontal axis,
Fig. 1 shows a clear separation between the clusters of Richardson
and Fielding entries, with Shamela lying towards the nearer edge
of the former cluster. Its nearest Fielding neighbour is an entry for
Amelia. On the vertical axis, the topmost entries are both for Pamela,
followed by two entries for Joseph Andrews. At the bottom lie two
entries for Richardson’s Familiar Letters while the entry for Fielding’s
Essay on Conversation lies (as the arrow indicates) far beyond the frame.
On this axis, Shamela lies near the centre of all the entries, with entries
for Clarissa just above it and entries for Sir Charles Grandison below it.
A scatter-plot for the word-variables themselves (as represented
in the first two principal components) underlies Fig. 1. It gives
added meaning, therefore, to that picture of the text specimens. It is
not reproduced here because it is easy to describe. The location of
the personal pronouns and the common inflected verbs around the
outskirts of the plot has most influence upon its shape. I, my, and me,
accompanied by you and your, lie close together at the far left, offset at
the far right by the and which. The third-person singular pronouns
and the common past-tense verbs lie at the top (with the titles Mr and
Mrs not far below them). At the bottom are we, our, it, an, and this,
together with the present-tense verb forms. The major prepositions
range across the ‘South-Eastern’ corner of the plot. Other common
words enrich this pattern but most of them lie further from the
outskirts and exert less influence on the shape of the whole group.
To traverse the vertical axis of Fig. 1 from top to bottom, it follows,
is to move from texts in which reported narrative predominates
to more discursive forms of writing. (‘He did’ and ‘she said’ stand

opposed to ‘we are’ and ‘it may be’.) On this basis, of course, the entries
for works of non-fiction should lie lowest of all, as indeed they do.
The much more powerful horizontal axis, meanwhile, separates the
authentic texts in accordance with their authorship; and it puts
Shamela with Richardson. Fielding’s imitation, on this analysis, seems
a complete success.
But such a straightforward authorial reading of Fig. 1 is facile.
Richardson’s fiction is always epistolary. It is couched, accordingly,
in the first person with frequent recourse to the particular you to whom
a given letter is addressed. Fielding, by contrast, unites impersonal
narration with dialogue: his fiction, accordingly, covers the gamut of
the common verbs and pronouns. There are sufficient grounds here
for a marked separation between the two authorial clusters. But, on
this evidence, one can scarcely say more of Shamela than that, being
epistolary like Pamela, it is bound to show a prima facie resemblance to
Richardson. Fig. 1, in short, is not false but it is inadequate.
To employ the Delta procedure, where a specimen is matched
against the work of many authors, we must turn away, for the moment,
from the direct contest between Fielding and Richardson. Several
trials of this kind with Shamela were a little more helpful. Neither
Richardson nor Fielding was ever far from the head of the field
of candidates, nor seized the lead. An appropriate outcome for a
hybrid text, one might suppose—but still no clear indication of
its authorship. Not quite like Fielding because his imitative attempt
is successful enough to obscure his own signature. Not quite like
Richardson because the attempt is not a complete success. But the Delta
procedure requires that one of its many candidates must lead the field.
The fact that Daniel Defoe emerged as the most consistent leader was
suggestive. Of all the 18th century male novelists tested, Defoe and
Richardson are most akin in their divergence from the formal stylistic
patterns of their classically educated fellows. Their vernacular, ad hoc
styles of first-person reportage differ from each other—but much less
than they differ from the rest. It is here that Fielding finds his target
and, in doing so, moves far enough from his usual stylistic repertoire
to defeat the tests employed so far:
Mrs. Jervis and I are just in Bed, and the Door unlocked; if my
Master should come—Odsbobs!! I hear him just coming in at the
Door. You see I write in the present Tense, as Parson Williams
says. Well, he is in Bed between us, we both shamming a Sleep,
he steals his Hand into my Bosom, which I, as if in my Sleep,
press close to me . . . (Henry Fielding, Shamela, Letter VI)
4 The Evidence of Less Common Words
4.1 Fielding vs. Richardson; Richardson vs. Fielding
In recent years, common-word procedures like those used above have
played a leading part in computational tests of authorship and have
Verifying the Authorship of a Parodic Text
Literary and Linguistic Computing, Vol. 20, No. 4, 2005 441
yielded many valuable results. The back-files of Literary and Linguistic
Computing and Computers and the Humanities offer abundant
examples. To use these methods, however, especially with short texts,
is to discard so much of one’s material that it is difficult to escape a
sense of thriftlessness.
Meanwhile, at the opposite end of the frequency-spectrum, there
is a centuries-old history of tests treating of words that can reasonably
be regarded as the property of a given target-author. If they also occur
in a text of doubtful authorship, they can be adduced as evidence.
The logic is impeccable but its practical implementation is beset with
difficulties. If the grounds on which words are accepted as the target-
author’s property are too weak, the evidence is of little weight. But,
if the grounds are strong, so few words pass muster that they cannot
be expected to occur, in convincing numbers, in the doubtful text.
We all have our pet expressions; but we do not use all or even most of
them whenever we pick up a pen. Their absence from a given text is
therefore of less evidential weight than their presence. And even their
presence does not count for much except through a cumulative impact.
The heart of the difficulty is that words are not often peculiar to
any one writer. Even a fresh coinage, like Shakespeare’s ‘incarnadine’
does not long remain his property. When it does recur, it is not in any
work of his.
But let us envisage a different approach, forsaking the quest for
words peculiar to a given writer’s work and looking, instead, for those
that recur there more often than they do in other writers. A little rule
might be designed to collect all the words that recurred to a stipulated
extent in a sizeable ‘base set’ of the target-author’s work. An accom-
panying rule would then exclude those among them that occurred too
freely in the ‘counter-set’ of work by an appropriate group of other
authors. A simple variant of the procedure (with which we shall begin)
could be employed in cases where only two authors were involved.
The object, one might say, is to give up the search for nuggets of pure
gold and try processing lower-grade ore.
The 100,659 word-tokens of my main set of Henry Fielding’s
writings embrace 7977 word-types. If this base set is broken into five
successive segments of 20,000 word-tokens, 2,247 of the word-types
occur in three or more segments. Of these, 1,109 word-types occur
no more than five times, all told, in the 100,129 word-tokens of
Richardson’s counter-set. At this point, a little cautious culling of the
list was undertaken in order to remove word-types whose frequency
patterns were aberrant enough to disturb the outcome. They included
proper names and words used principally as titles rather than as
common nouns, colonel, serjeant, doctor, and squire among them.
I culled thee and thy because they, too, occur often enough to create
special difficulties.
Finally and rather uncertainly, I culled hath but not doth. These
two words have long been recognized as characteristic of Henry
Fielding, used freely by him at a time when they were already archaic.
J. Burrows
442 Literary and Linguistic Computing, Vol. 20, No. 4, 2005
Hath occurs 188 times in his main set, not at all in Richardson’s
main set, and twice in our 197,035-word selection from Pamela. The
corresponding figures for doth are fifty-two, one, and one. Hath occurs
fifty times in the 14,144 words of Shamela and doth fifteen. It seemed
to me that, while Fielding’s use of hath in Shamela is a sign of his
authorship, its high frequency there would give it undue weight among
the occurrence rates we shall be assessing. (With hath omitted, book, at a
frequency of twenty, was the highest single score remaining for
Shamela). All told, fifteen word-types, were culled, leaving an initial
working-list of 1094. In hindsight, much of this culling made little
difference. But cases where the matter is of some weight can arise
unexpectedly. Simple is a word favoured by Henry Fielding. When
Sarah Fielding uses it as the name of a protagonist, its frequency pattern
runs amok. Instead of making questionable decisions, case by case,
about words like hath and simple, it may be best to adopt
David Hoover’s more objective scheme of culling all word-types that
occur disproportionately often in any one test-specimen.2
Raw frequencies for the chosen word-list are extracted from each
of the test specimens and set beside those for the base set and the
counter-set in a single work-sheet. (Microsoft Excel is well-suited to the
purpose.) In the present case, the first work-sheet embraces 1094
rows for the chosen word-types and twenty-nine columns of actual data
for the specimens listed in Table 1. Fielding supplies the base set
of 100,659 word-tokens, Richardson the counter-set of 100,129. There
is a single entry for Shamela, followed by ten for the segments of
Pamela, and sixteen for the Fielding specimens. The behaviour of the
base set and the counter-set is heavily constrained by their role in
establishing the word-list. But the other twenty-seven specimens are
free agents.
The total of all the raw frequencies in each column is calculated
and then turned into a rate per thousand of the word-tokens in each
text. After that, it is easy to sort, cut, and recalculate so as to vary
the stipulations. The stipulation for the base set can be tightened to
include only those word-types that occur in four or even all five of
the Fielding segments. The counter-set can be tightened to exclude
those word-types that occur five or four or three times, twice, or even
once in Richardson. Lax restrictions do not yield an effective contrast
between the authors under scrutiny. Unduly tight restrictions reduce
the word-list to a point where the numbers are too fragile to carry
much evidential weight.
Table 2 summarizes the outcome of a series of tests in which
the threshold for the base set was held steady at three segments out
of five while the number of occurrences allowed in the counter-set
was progressively reduced from five to zero. This had the effect,
as shown, of reducing the word-list, step by step, from 1,094 to 289.
The constrained contrast between base set and counter-set, registered as
rates per thousand words, began as 80.94 against 20.66. In the final
step, it stood at 18.33 against zero.

As for the test specimens, the outcome is clear. In every column
except the first from the left (where the stipulations imposed may
simply be too strict), Shamela leans towards Fielding, in a pattern
favouring his authorship. A close scrutiny of the individual scores,
a comparison of averages, and a weighing of z-scores all point that way.
The very low standard deviations for the test specimens show that each
set of data is cohesive. And the range of z-scores implies that the
outcome is of considerable statistical weight. Those for the contrast

between Shamela and Fielding, lying around –3.00, show a clear
divergence from his usual vocabulary. Those for the contrast between
Shamela and Pamela, ranging up from þ5.00, register sharply different
populations. So far as these tests are concerned, therefore, Shamela
lies at the edge of Fielding’s lexical repertoire but quite beyond
Richardson’s. Student’s t-test and discriminant analysis might be
used to verify these comments, but it seems unnecessary to labour the
obvious.
Let us turn instead to the obverse case, taking Richardson as base
set and Fielding as counter-set. Richardson’s 100,129 word-tokens
embrace 7063 word-types. When the set is split into five segments,
1,856 of these word-types occur in three or more of the five. Exactly
700 of them occur five times or fewer in Fielding’s counter-set. After six
words were culled, the remaining 694 were treated in the same fashion
as before.
As Table 3 shows, the inversion of the process reinforces the original
result. With Richardson as base set, the scores for Pamela are now
in the ascendant. Those for Fielding lie far below them. Those for
Shamela lie in between, but are always closer to Fielding. Once again,
the standard deviations are so low (in proportion to their various mean
scores) that the data can be seen as highly cohesive. And, if the distance
between Shamela and the mean scores for each author’s set of test
specimens is measured in z-scores, the previous proposition
is surpassed. Shamela now lies within Fielding’s range but beyond
Richardson’s. A comparison between the z-scores in Table 2 and those
in Table 3 yields a further point. As a parodist, not unexpectedly,
Fielding is more successful in capturing elements of Richardson’s
vocabulary than in abandoning his own.
4.2 Fielding vs. nineteen others
In the face of the evidence offered so far, a scholar—even one who
believed that Samuel Richardson might laugh at himself—would seem
ill-advised to argue that Shamela is Richardson’s. But, while this
evidence distinguishes parody from target, it does not adequately
address the question of Fielding’s authorship. We have yet to test the
claim that it is not his work. Although the idea need not be pursued
too strenuously, it is at least worth illustrating how a real problem of
this sort might be approached.
The immediate requirements are, first, an adequate main set of texts
by other novelists who were at work around the middle of the 18th
century and, second, an adequate set of test specimens by them and
also by some others. As in the previous case, my old set of ‘histories’
have been forsaken and fresh texts are used for the purpose. They are
listed in Table 4.
Within the limits of availability, the main set of texts in Table 4
was chosen to range across the prose fiction of the mid 18th century at
a rate of about 20,000 words per author. The set of test specimens
was more carefully designed. Except for Bage’s Hermsprong, these texts
Verifying the Authorship of a Parodic Text
Literary and Linguistic Computing, Vol. 20, No. 4, 2005 445
also fell within about 30 years on either side of Shamela. (Bage was
added because he, like Smollett, is thought to resemble Fielding.)
Nine of the fourteen authors are represented in the main set, six by
selections from works other than those used in the main set and
Richardson by selections from each of his novels. In order to see
whether entirely independent agents would perform differently, the
group also includes five whose work does not figure in the main set.

comprises sixteen specimens to balance the original set of test
specimens by Fielding.
For the trials whose outcome is set out in Table 5, Fielding supplies
the base set of 100,659 word-tokens. Since the first stipulation (that
a word-type occur in at least three of the five 20,000-word segments) is
unchanged, we begin as before with 2,247 word-types. The counter-set
now embraces 397,820 word-tokens by nineteen authors. In order to
accentuate authorial individuality, the second stipulation was modified

yielded 838 word-types as the word-list for a first trial, whose outcome
is recorded in the right-hand column of Table 5. As before, the strong
contrast between the scores for main set and counter-set (55.18 vs.
23.03 per thousand) means no more than that the behaviour of those
two sets is constrained by the chosen stipulations. As before, the scores
for the two sets of test specimens are successfully distinguished. The
mean scores for the two sets stand well apart: 37.97 for Fielding, 25.76
for the counter-set. Standard deviations of 4.44 and 4.28 show that
the difference between the mean scores is is of real weight.
At 30.91, Smollett’s score, the highest of the sixteen, is the only one
to exceed the lowest of the sixteen Fielding entries, 30.63 for The Female
Husband, a sort of ‘documentary fiction’.
So far, so good. But, at 29.98 per thousand, the score for Shamela
falls neatly between the mean scores for the other test specimens. The z-
scores show that, while it is closer to the sixteen than to Fielding, it is
within the ordinary range of divergence for each of them. The result is
as inconclusive as those yielded by the common-word tests employed at
the beginning of this article.
As the second stipulation is progressively tightened, it becomes clear
that the original allowance was too lax. In the second column from the
right of Table 5, bearing on the 604 word-types that occur in no more
than seven of the nineteen authors, Shamela lies a little closer to
Fielding than to the rest and even the highest of them falls short of
Shamela and of any Fielding entry. The z-scores, however, are still too
weak to yield a firm conclusion.
The trend strengthens in the next two columns, treating of word-
types that occur in no more than five and three, respectively, of the
nineteen authors. The mean scores stand in sharp contrast. The ultimate
diversity of the counter-set is beginning to manifest itself in relatively
high standard deviations and some of the higher scores surpass
Fielding’s minimum while falling short of Shamela. The z-scores no
longer show any meaningful divergence from Fielding but the diver-
gence from the others is very marked. The scores shown in the
remaining column of Table 5 treat of the sixty-one word-types that
occur in no more than one of the nineteen authors. They extravagantly
favour Fielding’s authorship. But by now we are beginning to deal in
frequencies too low for this approach. In the last column, even so, we
see further evidence that Henry Fielding was indeed the author of
Shamela. And, by the same token, we see a promising new way of
identifying the authors of imitative texts whose provenance is less
secure.
Figure 2 highlights these results and shows their strength. It can
be left, by now, to speak for itself. But it should not be regarded
as a substitute for the more detailed evidence of Table 5. It shows,
more vividly than the Table, that Shamela resembles Fielding more
closely than it resembles the generality of his fellows. The Table adds,
for example, the crucial point that it resembles Fielding more closely
than it resembles any of the others.
Verifying the Authorship of a Parodic Text
Literary and Linguistic Computing, Vol. 20, No. 4, 2005 449
With only sixty-one word-types still qualifying, the left-hand
column of Table 5 is an appropriate point to abandon our present
approach. Beyond this, it is better to forsake overall word-counts and
examine the words themselves. At the extreme, only two word-types
occur in all five segments of the base set and nowhere in the nineteen-
author counter-set. They are doth and lastly, which occur fifty-two and
fifteen times respectively in the base set. They occur fifteen times
and twice, respectively, in Shamela and, like hath, help to mark the
authorship of that work.
As mentioned earlier, hath and doth are recognized as words used
freely by Henry Fielding when most others had forsaken them. It is
possible, it seems, to put lastly beside them, though rather as a word
whose day was yet to come. After being detected as a word that does
not occur in all the 397,820 word-tokens of our counter-set, it is
no wonder that it is a rare bird among the sixteen test specimens.
Of those 199,192 word-tokens, it yields only two—one in Sarah
Fielding and one in Swift. A potent enough indicator to offer us a little
coda? Not altogether. While its presence is indeed a sign of Henry
Fielding, it is not a reliable indicator: it occurs in only ten of the sixteen
Fielding test specimens. Its effect is actually more potent when it is
allied with others, mostly less striking in themselves. When they are
gathered in sufficient numbers according to appropriate stipulations,
they yield the compelling results shown in the central columns of
Table 5. And that is no mere flourish.
