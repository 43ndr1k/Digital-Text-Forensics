Abstract The present study proposes an analysis process to assess and enrich the results
of a previous qualitative study on science and spirituality (Sbalchiero in Scienza e
spiritualità: Ruoli e percezioni della ricerca nel mondo contemporaneo, 2012; Sbalchiero in
Testing Pluralism: Globalizing Belief, 2013) by means of quantitative methods. Moving
from qualitative findings, that envisaged a set of in-depth interviews with 24 Italian sci-
entists, statistical analyses of textual data are applied on the same interviews in order to
compare and contrast results and evaluate the opportunity of integrating different ap-
proaches. This review of qualitative results resorts to methods for classification of context
units (Reinert in Les Cahiers de l’Analyse des Donnees 8:187–198, 1983), text clustering
(Berry in Survey of Text Mining. Clustering, Classification, and Retrieval, 2004) and
lexical correspondence analysis (Lebart et al. in Exploring textual data, 1998) in a general
framework of content analysis and ‘‘lexical worlds’’ exploration (Reinert in Langage So-
ciété, 1993), i.e. the identification of main topics and words used by Italian scientists to talk
about the relationship among science, religion, spirituality. Results confirm the poten-
tialities of mixed method approaches and shed light on how quantitative methods might
become useful when available interviews increase in number and size.

1 Introduction
In recent years mixed methods have gained ground in influential research agendas and
today the needs of new research tools often lead to methods that integrate qualitative and
quantitative perspectives (Bernard and Ryan 2010; Creswell 2013; Maxwell 2012; Roberts
2000; Tashakkori and Teddlie 2003). This renewed interest builds on a well-established
framework in which qualitative and quantitative approaches are not necessary mutually
exclusive (Johnson et al. 2007), particularly in the application of content analysis methods.
For example, in the qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews quantitative approaches
might be used:
1. To explore, discover, and examine the main topics (or latent dimensions) emerging
from interviews (as an ex ante explorative method);
2. To measure the similarity of interviews included in the same class, when a qualitative
classification by topics or respondents is available (as an in itinere evaluation method);
3. To test hypotheses and verify how contents have been categorized and classified by
qualitative analysis (as an ex post confirmative method).
Scholars also apply both perspective on the same data to assess the consistency of
results from the very beginning and often in an interdisciplinary environment. As an
example, previous attempts of combining qualitative and quantitative approaches and in-
volving scholars from different disciplines already proved fruitful in the analysis of po-
litical discourses (Cortelazzo and Gambarotto 2013; Tuzzi et al. 2010; Bara et al. 2007;
Cortelazzo and Tuzzi 2007; Schonhardt-Bailey 2005; Bolasco et al. 2006). From a
methodological perspective the challenge is to ensure that quantitative and qualitative
methods might be combined for cross-validation as well as triangulation and comple-
mentary purposes.
In this study, the main findings of a first qualitative analysis of interviews on science
and spirituality (Sbalchiero 2012) are compared and contrasted with results obtained by
statistical analysis of textual data as an ex post confirmative method. However, this study
aims not only at confirming the apparent potentialities of mixed method approaches in
analyzing the contents of in-depth interviews but also at showing that the advantages of
quantitative methods increase as available interviews increase in number and size.
The concept of spirituality is evidence of religious change (Wuthnow 1998; De Marco
and Miniati 2006; Giordan 2006; Lanzetti 2006) and central in any attempt to understand
the traces of the sacred in border areas that are traditionally beyond the mainstream forms
of religion. There are different approaches to the issue of spirituality and also different
definitions of the concept (Roof 1993, 1999; Zinnbauer et al. 1997; Heelas and Woodhead
2005). Although, the primacy of the individual experience is evident: each individual
freely chooses what he/she believes and how to behave. The personal sacred world is not
limited to something specific and consequently each person may find support in the
teachings of traditional religions as well as in scientific knowledge and personal experience
(Giordan 2006). Since different forms of spirituality are difficult to recognize, interpret and
explain, asking people directly is often essential to gain their point of view, especially with
scientists (and atheist scientists).
The above mentioned qualitative study investigated the relationship among spirituality,
science and religion by means of in-depth interviews with Italian scientists. The purpose of
in-depth interviews was to explore the sense and meanings that scientists gave to their own
scientific experience and the relation among scientific experiences, religion, spirituality.

Main findings established that the spiritual dimensions are rooted in what scientists
themselves feel about their scientific experience and led to an unprecedented category of
‘‘spiritual scientists’’ that shows many similarities between the American and the Italian
cases: results suggested that there are both forms of identification, i.e. ‘‘spirituality of
believers’’ and ‘‘non-religious but spiritual’’ (Ecklund and Long 2011; Sbalchiero 2013).
2 Corpus and data
The corpus includes 24 in-depth interviews with Italian scientists of two different fields
(physics and biology) selected from departments of seven Italian universities.1 The sci-
entists were interviewed in face-to-face settings and the duration of interviews ranged from
1 h and 15 min to 2 h. All interviews were recorded and fully transcribed afterwards.
The number of scientists is balanced in terms of field, gender, and position (Table 1).
The decision to differentiate young scientists at the beginning of their career (mainly young
researchers) from senior scientists, who have carried out their research activities for many
years ([20 years, mainly full professors), originated from the need to check whether the
perception of spirituality is related to duration of scientific careers. Due to the explorative
character of the research question, an interview guide made possible to keep orientation
and cover all areas of investigation during the interview, even if the order of topics varied
among interviews.
The interview guide consisted in three main parts, with topics ranging from general to
specific questions:
1. Education, career plans, and other background information;
2. Scientific work experience;
3. Meaning of scientific work in relation to objects of study, and the sense and meanings
that scientists give to their own scientific experience.
The third part included questions on religion and the perceiving of spirituality, i.e. what
relation or connection the scientists saw between spirituality and religion, and to what
extent the spiritual reference was compatible with the scientific forma mentis.
Considering only the respondents’ answers and discarding the interviewers’ utterances,
the size of the interviews available for this new study ranges from 2298 to 7668 words
(4537 on average). The whole corpus mirrors a vocabulary of V = 5880 different words
and includes N = 108,897 occurrences. In the bag-of-words perspective, the vocabulary is
a representation of the corpus and reports the list of different words with their frequencies,
i.e. the number of corresponding occurrences in the interviews and in the corpus as a
whole. Two rough measures of lexical richness are useful to assess whether a corpus is
sufficiently large for statistical purposes: since the Type-Token Ratio (V/N) amounts to
5.6 % (\20 %), and the percentage of words with only one occurrence (hapax legomena) is
45.4 % (\50 %), a statistical analysis of textual data seems viable (Bolasco 1999, 2013).
Further criteria (Popescu et al. 2009; Muller and Brunet 1988) are relevant to assess the
homogeneity of the interviews included in the corpus before any quantitative analysis of
textual data. As far as language is concerned, one of the tenets of research in linguistics and
sociolinguistics is variation (Coseriu 1973; Berruto 1987) In our case the language variable
(all interviews are in Italian), as well as diaphasic (all texts are transcriptions of spoken

123
interviews), diachronic (all interviews took place in the same period), and diamesic var-
iation (they are all spoken-transcripted texts) were offset. Diastratic variation is limited (in
terms of both the respondents and interviewers’ social class and educational level) as well
as diatopic variation (the speakers’ geographical origin doesn’t play an important role for
content analysis). Vice versa, the specific features of respondents and topics are the main
focus of the analysis.
The corpus were pre-processed by means of the Taltac22 dedicated software (Bolasco
et al. 2010) and textual data were processed by means of R3 (R Development Core Team
2014) and Iramuteq4 (Ratinaud 2009; Retinaud and Déjean 2009).
3 Methods
In many studies a traditional qualitative content analysis of interviews already proved
fruitful in combining topics into category-based analysis (Strauss and Corbin 1990; Bry-
man and Burgess 1994; Braun and Clarke 2006). An overview of the coding process
applied to our interviews in order to find categories referred to science, religion and
spirituality is shown in Table 2, adapted from Creswell (2002).
In the previous qualitative analysis of our interviews the coding procedure was based on
classification of each sentence into a range of thematic topics (Savin-Baden and Major
2013; Creswell 2012) in order to develop inductively a limited number of categories (as
homogeneous as possible in a within-perspective and as heterogeneous as possible in a
between-perspective). After reading through all the interviews, the steps were the follow:
1. Identify a set of themes;
2. Ascribe each sentence to a label that synthetically represent its main essence;
3. Merge into macro-categories labels that express a similar meaning.
Finally, to reduce overlap and redundancy among categories, the merging procedure led
to only three different categories that related to how the scientists characterize their
thinking on the relationship among spirituality, science and religion. Due to the limited
number of interviews, the qualitative analysis seemed to be a valuable method for this kind
of research. Nevertheless, problems such as the subjectivity of researcher, reliability of the
analysis, and comparability of results, remained unresolved (Corbetta 1999), no to talk
about the problem of dealing with interviews when their number and size increase.

Scientists’ spirituality in scientists’ words…
123
To assess the results of this first qualitative analysis, we propose a quantitative approach
based on three phases:
1. Computer assisted classification of portions of in-depth interviews that deal with the
same topics and selection of portions concerning the relationship among science,
religion and spirituality;
2. Cluster analysis of respondents;
3. Content analysis of each groups of respondents by means of correspondence analysis.
3.1 Reinert’s method to extract lexical worlds
In any in-depth interview a specific theme often does not emerge as an answer to a specific
question but in any part of the talk, for example when our respondents brought up at the
beginning of the interview themes that were planned for a later section. A topic-based
classification of portions of interviews may prove useful to pool together all portions
consistent with a specific topic. The effect of such a procedure that involves the selection
of portions of texts and their classification into classes led to a reduction of available
textual data but, at the same time, to more homogeneous subcorpora of texts.
Reinert’s method consists in a classification of small portions of texts into classes, i.e.
the ‘‘lexical worlds’’ (Reinert 1990, 1993, 1999, 2001). A lexical world is a specific
vocabulary (set of words), which inherits its properties from what the respondent is talking
about (Reinert 1993, p. 13), and it is extracted from the whole corpus without any a priori
information.
First of all, Reinert’s algorithm splits texts in elementary context units of approximately
similar length, which are sentences, or fragments of sentences, delimited by punctuation
marks. Then, the algorithm checks the occurrence and co-occurrences of content words5 in
each unit and reports results in a matrix6 (words x units). The occurrence and co-occur-
rence of words in units is the base to assess similarity among units that is summarized by
means of a clustering procedure. The result is a hierarchical tree diagram (dendrogram)
that groups units into classes that mirror a similar lexical context.
The algorithm performs a descending classification, i.e. it detects the clusters and the
factors which better represent a specific lexical world (sets of units that include words that
are relevant for the same cluster). The classification of units allow to automatically identify
and extract only portions of texts concerning the same topic, and for each cluster also the
list of most significant words is easily identified by means of the v2 measure (Reinert
1999).
The main advantage of this first step is the opportunity of quickly investigating the
whole corpus of interviews to obtain an automatic classification of small portions of texts
into a limited number of clusters that reflect its main contents (and should reflect the
interviews’ main area of investigation). Moreover, this classification provides a first
assessment of the general characteristics of the corpus and should not be affected by the
analyst’s bias.
5 In this phase all grammatical words (i.e., articles, conjunctions, etc.) are disregarded.
6 The cells of the matrix report for each elementary context unit the presence or absence of each word.

3.2 Classification of respondents by text clustering
All portions of texts that belong to the same cluster concern the same topic but are part of
the interviews of different respondents that, in they turn, reflect different orientations and
opinions. In order to distinguish whether different orientations emerge among respon-
dents, we can take into consideration a new reduced version of the respondents’ inter-
view that include only the portions of the same cluster and discard all the rest of the
interview.
Text clustering (Berry 2004) is a specific kind of unsupervised document classification
aimed at grouping similar texts to form consistent clusters and separating dissimilar texts
into distinct clusters. To group respondents, we need a distance, i.e. a (dis)similarity
measure able to assess to what extent each interview may be considered similar to (or
different from) another. Among hundreds of available measures (Rudman 1998) we pro-
pose Labbé’s intertextual distance (Labbé 2001, 2007; Pauli and Tuzzi 2009; Tuzzi 2010;
Cortelazzo et al. 2013).
The list of words with the number of corresponding occurrences mirrors the lexical
profile of each interview. Labbé’s distance is based on a sum of differences between the
frequencies of words in two texts. Given a pair of interviews A and B of size NA and NB
with NA B NB, their distance d is:
d A;Bð Þ ¼
P
i2VA[B
fi;A  f i;B






2NA
where VA[B represents the vocabulary of A and B (as a whole) and the frequency fi,B of
each words i in the larger interview B is reduced according to the size of the shorter
interview A by means of a simple proportion
f i;B ¼ fi;B
NA
NB
.
The distance between A and B is the same as the distance between B and A, that is, the
distance is symmetrical, and the distance between each interview and itself amounts to zero
and, more generally, if the interviews of two respondents contain the same words with the
same frequency, their distance amounts to zero. If two interviews have no words in
common, they are separated by a distance amounting to one (maximum theoretical
distance).
The intertextual distances calculated for all pairs of respondents were evaluated through
an agglomerative hierarchical cluster algorithm with complete linkage (Everitt 1980), i.e.
the distance between pairs of clusters was obtained as the maximum distance among all
pairs of elements of the two clusters; pairs of clusters with minimum distance were ag-
gregated. The dendrogram represents the distances by means of a tree graph in which the
leaves (respondents) hanging from the same branch form clusters of the closest interviews
and branches originating from the same forks represent groups of similar respondents.
Most common algorithms for text clustering include instructions to summarize some
textual features as simple quantitative measures and use them to recognize the degree of

123
similarity (or dissimilarity) among texts (Grieve 2007; Koppel et al. 2009; Stamatatos
2009). When expert-based information on correct classification of respondents is not
available, reference can be made to unsupervised classification of their interviews without
reference to external information.
3.3 Content mapping
As a final output of this third step, we aimed at achieving a map of the main contents
expressed by the groups of respondents that show a similar orientation. To interpret the
different groups’ orientations, a content analysis of the lexical profiles of each group
(represented by the subcorpus of interviews of its members) was conducted by means of a
classical (lexical) correspondence analysis (CA). CA (Greenacre 1984, 2007; Murtagh
2005; Lebart et al. 1984) is a special case of the principal component analysis (PCA) of the
rows and columns of a table, i.e. it is applicable to a contingency table words x groups and
is based on singular value decomposition (eigenvalues/eigenvectors). CA is aimed at
transforming the frequencies of words in coordinates on a multidimensional Cartesian axes
system: it displays the groups and words in a low-dimensional space by mapping an
appropriate distance (the v2 distance) into a specific Euclidean distance (Murtagh 2005)
and, then, into Cartesian planes. CA is based on the lexical profiles of the groups and is
aimed at highlighting the relations among groups, words, and groups and words. The
groups’ positions on the planes are determined by the degree of similarity in terms of
lexical profile, i.e. groups who are plotted in the same quadrant of the plane mirror the
same orientation, that is described by the words of the same area of the plot. By means of
their mutual positions, the main contents being conveyed may be effectively reconstructed
on a map.
4 Results
4.1 Lexical worlds
The first important aspect revealed by Reinart’s method7 is the clear-cut existence of three
different lexical worlds. Our 24 interviews were fragmented in 3766 portions (elementary
context units including 27 words on average) and the classification procedure produced
three clusters (Fig. 1).
These three clusters together represent the 94 % of the units. This percentage indicates
that the classification is robust, since only few units are discarded (6 %). In order to
describe the main topic of each cluster, we resorted to the list of most significant words.
The first cluster (cluster No. 1, 58.8 % of units) contains words8 mainly related to the
relationship among science, religion and spirituality, i.e. the most interesting lexical world
of our interviews:
science (scienza, 539), to believe (credere, 179), sense (senso, 168), life (vita, 204),
answer (risposta, 94), man (uomo, 115), question (domanda, 88), knowledge
(conoscenza, 124), religion (religione, 53), faith (fede, 53), mission (missione, 50),

vocation (vocazione, 37), spirit (spirito, 28), scientific (scientifico, 203), to live (vivere,
43), mystic (mistico, 34), human (umano, 52), awareness (consapevolezza, 18), to exist
(esistere, 55), to feel (sentire, 83), intuition (intuizione, 27).
The second and smaller cluster (cluster No. 2, 17.3 % of units) contains words referred
to a lexical world in which scientists tell about their scientific work expericence.
particle (particella, 80), theory (teoria, 57), universe (universo, 63), model (modello,
37), mass (massa, 24), to explain (spiegare, 46), higgs (higgs, 21), boson (bosone, 18),
interaction, (interazione, 19), force (forza, 15), dna (dna, 19), fundamental (fondamen-
tale, 35), matter (materia, 35), structure (struttura, 17), star (stella, 17), origin (origine,
17), to interpret (interpretare, 10), phenomenon (fenomeno, 18), law (legge, 11), to
discover (scoprire, 22), energy (energia, 14).
The third cluster (cluster No. 3, 23.9 % of units) contains words mainly linked to the
narration of the scientists’ career development.
year (anno, 105), to work (lavorare, 74), thesis (tesi, 44), university (università, 46),
biology (biologia, 36), degree (laurea, 26), cern (cern, 34), physic (fisica, 96), professor
(professore, 25), laboratory (laboratorio, 41), course (corso, 22), to decide (decidere,
23), to enroll (iscriversi, 19), Ph.D. (dottorato, 27), faculty (facoltà, 17), to study
(studiare, 45), to choose (scegliere, 25), interest (interesse, 21), career (carriera, 15),
experiment (esperimento, 43), path (percorso, 25).
The first step of our analysis highlights that three different lexical worlds coexist in our
interviews and these worlds show a specific vocabulary that proves relevant from a
qualitative perspective. As the in-depth interviews followed a set of flexible open-ended
questions, the classification helped us to identify three main topics and they mirror the
three main parts of the interview guide, despite information about these topics are spread
out all over in the answers.
4.2 Automatic classification of respondents
In the second step of the analysis, we took into consideration only the first cluster in order
to explore the sense that scientists gave to their own scientific experience, and its relation
to religion and spirituality. The subcorpus that include only the 2081 units of the first
cluster contains V = 4129 words and N = 65,840 occurrences. The selection of units
included in cluster No. 1 led to a reduction of the interviews (Fig. 2).

the three clusters detected in the
corpus (24 interviews, 3766
units)

123
The selection of the portions of cluster No. 1 reduced the length of interviews and
discarded portions where respondents talked about other topics. The effect of this reduction
led to more homogeneous texts both in length and contents.
The intertextual distance was calculated for all pairs of respondents and expressed by a
24 9 24 square matrix. The total number of (non-redundant, non-identical) pairs to be
considered is 276, given by the formula (24 9 23)/2. The square matrix reports data on
similarities (and differences) between (reduced) interviews and has been evaluated through
an agglomerative hierarchical cluster algorithm with complete linkage. The results of the
clustering procedure are represented by means of a dendrogram (Fig. 3) and three main
groups of respondents are highlighted.

young researcher; Az: full professor), e.g. 01BiFIz represents the first interview given by a young woman,
biologist
S. Sbalchiero et al.
123
An overview of the characteristics of each group after classification of respondents is
shown in Table 3.
Groups No. 1 and 2 include, respectively, 8 and 6 interviews mainly of young re-
searchers, while group No. 3 includes ten interviews of senior researchers with many years
of experience. A gender-based difference among groups does not emerge, whilst the sci-
entific field membership seems to differentiate between Group No. 1 (Biology) and No. 2
(Physics). Age and scientific experience of scientists influence the composition of all
groups. Consequently, it is conceivable that the perception of spirituality and its links with
religion and science are related mostly to duration of scientific careers.
4.3 Correspondence analysis
Results of the cluster analysis of respondents clearly differentiate between young and
senior researchers, and among three lexical profiles. Correspondence analysis maps
similarities, differences and dichotomies among groups of respondents in term of contents.
Starting from the contingency table that reports the frequencies of words in the interviews
of the members of the three groups of respondents, the graph of correspondence analysis
shows the patterns of the three groups on the first factorial plan (Fig. 4).
With reference to the first axis (horizontal), the first group of respondents (Group 1) is
on the lefthand side, opposite to Group 3. The second axis (vertical) mainly distinguish the
position of Group 2.

123
The correspondence plan suggests that the perception of science, religion, and
spirituality relates to the scientists’ scientific careers and experiences. Words and orien-
tations clearly differentiate among the groups:
Group 1 Spirituality (spiritualità), opportunity (opportunità), improvement (migliora-
mento), road (viaggio), existence (esistenza), explication (spiegazione), mission (mis-
sione), personal (personale), conception (concezione), atheist (ateo), experience
(sperimentare), sense (senso), and mystery (mistero);
Group 3 Total (totale), commitment (impegno), culture (cultura), church (chiesa), to
control (controllare), being (essere), collective (collettivo), attitude (atteggiamento), ser-
vice (servizio), immersion (immersione), strictness (rigore), method (metodo), doubt
(dubbio), reason (ragione), value (valore), deep (profondo), and control (controllo);
Group 2 Collaboration (collaborazione), aspiration (aspirazione), pseudoscientific
(pseudoscientifiche), intuition (intuizione), loneliness (solitudine), to perceive (percepire),
detachment (distacco), devotion (dedizione), fondness (passione).

5 Discussion and conclusions
The present study reports an attempt to assess the results of an exploratory qualitative
research on science and spirituality by means of quantitative methods.
Although the main results have already been discussed elsewhere (Sbalchiero 2012), it
is worth mentioning that three main portraits emerged from the previous qualitative study:
(a) orientation to a new spirituality; (b) plausibility between science and spirituality; and
(c) traditional spirituality (Sbalchiero 2013). According to the first orientation (a), scien-
tists talked about spirituality considering it as fluid and dynamic; moreover, they open to
contamination and assert the primacy of the freedom of individual choice. In the second
orientation (b) features directly related to spirituality underline the conviction that
spirituality is compatible with scientific activity. Finally, the third orientation (c) gather the
quota of scientists who perceive spirituality in traditional terms, i.e. it is referred to an
organized and hierarchical system (such as a Church) and, consequently, necessarily im-
plies the acknowledgment of a God. When viewed jointly, scientists who fall into the first
two categories (a and b) feel the need to explore their spirituality without ties with specific
religious orientations, and also claim their openness to the mysterious and the transcendent,

notwithstanding their being atheist-agnostic. The personal perception of these scientists
and their redefinition of the very ambits of the sacred (Giordan 2006; Wuthnow 1998)
show that a form of ‘‘non-religious but spiritual’’ identification is possible (Ecklund and
Long 2011).
In the present new study, the corpus of interviews has been explored in the frame of
statistical analyses of textual data, in order to compare and contrast results and evaluate the
opportunity of integrating different approaches. Without any a priori information, a first
step permitted to automatically identify and extract portions of texts concerning the re-
lationship among science, religion and spirituality. The following clustering procedure
permitted to classify into three groups the respondents on the basis of their lexical profiles,
again without any a priori information about their membership. Finally, the results of
correspondence analysis detailed the main lexical content of each group and highlighted
the specific features of three different orientations. Scientists included in Group 1 state the
primacy of the subject contrasting their personal experience of spirituality with the dogma
of traditional religion. On the contrary, Group 3 emphasizes the collective dimension
(mainly referred to an organized system such as a Church) and the strong ties with a
religion that remains essential as well as the acknowledgment of a God. In the middle,
Group 2 is represented by accommodative scientists that bridge the others: in their words
there is a coexistence of spiritual and religious instances and, at the same time, the need of
a rational comprehension of the universe.
The findings of the quantitative analysis are consistent with the ones of the previous
qualitative study, but also support the strengths of mixed method approaches and suggest to
what extent quantitative methods might become useful when available interviews increase
in number and size. In terms of the main objectives of a qualitative analysis, which are
descriptive in nature, a quantitative analysis of textual data provides effective tools for the
representation of models and visualization of contents. Moreover, the advantages of these
approaches concern the opportunity to reduce the analysist’s biases and go beyond main
(obvious) limitations to qualitative analysis e.g. (a) quickly and cheaply investigate huge
ammounts of data in a systematic way; (b) explore latent patterns; and (c) improve the
robustness of results. Quantitative methods are not meant to replace traditional qualitative
approaches but in this study it provided tools for verifying intuitions and expanding on
specific issues identified by qualitative analysis. In conclusion, the present study supports
the idea that no operating philosophy or procedure may be said to be preferred a priori or in
absolute terms and proposes a repeatable procedure useful to achieve a more thorough
understanding of social phenomena.
