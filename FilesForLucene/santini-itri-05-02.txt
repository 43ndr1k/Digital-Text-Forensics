Abstract
In this report we propose a new set of features for automatic genre and text type identification: 
linguistic facets. The label linguistic facet has been created to stress the fact that each of the
features in this new set highlights a facet, i.e. an aspect in the communicative context that is
reflected in the use of language. Linguistic facets subsume two set of features: functional cues
and syntactic patterns. Functional cues are not completely new. Syntactic patterns, instead,
have never been tried before in any automatic approach. Both functional cues and syntactic
patterns are linguistically-motivated features that can be interpreted functionally. The effort is 
to derive from text-internal linguistic cues the communicative context in which the text has
been produced/consumed. With linguistically-motivated and functionally-interpretable features
it is possible to combine qualitative analysis and quantitative findings, and get a more accurate
text analysis together with genre and text type identification. Preliminary results show that 
linguistic facets have a robust discriminating power for web genre classification.

1 Introduction 
In this report we propose a new set of features for automatic genre and text 
type identification: linguistic facets.
Several definitions of the notions of genre and text type have been proposed so 
far for an automatic approach (see Santini 2004a for a review). Here by genre we 
refer to the socio-cultural, textual and linguistic conventions used in a
document. When conforming to a set of well-recognised conventions, a
document becomes a member of recognized family of similar documents, i.e a
genre. By text type, instead, we refer to the discoursal/rhetorical strategies 
enacted in the document. According to this distinction, an academic paper is a
genre with its own textual organization and linguistic conventions, accepted 
and recognized by academic people, who represent the socio-cultural
environment in which this genre is used and useful. Academic papers usually 
have an argumentative text type, which means that the predominant rhetorical 
strategy enacted in this genre is to “make an argument”, i.e. to demonstrate that 
the claim put forward by the writer(s) is convincing.
An element that the notions of genre and text type share is that, broadly 
speaking, they are both orthogonal to the notion of topic (Meyer zu Eissend and
Stein 2004, Lee and Myaeng 2004, Lim et al.  2005, etc.) In fact, the same topic
can be expressed in different genres, using different text types. While the
automatic classification of topical categories (text categorization) is based on 
content words (the so-called bag-of-words approach), the automatic
identification of genre and text type is based on grammatical features, ranging 
from part-of-speech (POS) tags, to functional words, some ratios, syntactic cues, 
and so on (see next section). The broad term identification is used here as an 
umbrella term subsuming analysis, detection and classification. While the 
automatic approach to text type has focussed on textual analysis, language 
variation and detection (Biber 1988, 1995, Nakamura 1993, Wickberg 1993, etc.), 
the automatic approach to genre has centered upon classification tasks (Cutting 
and Karlgren 1994, Kessler 1994, etc.). Both automatic approaches tend to share
the same family of features.
The label linguistic facet has been created to stress the fact that each of the
features in this new set highlights a facet, i.e. an aspect in the communicative
context that is reflected in the use of language. For example, the use of activity 
verbs (see Subsection 4.1), which denote actions related to choices, is very
common in instructions and conversation. Therefore the facet “activity verbs”
links the frequencies of occurrence of a specific group of verbs in a text to the
purpose of the text (to give instructions) or to the live situation (a conversation).
The frequencies of occurrence, or sometimes the mere presence of a facet, help 
us understand the use and the variation of the language across different kinds 
of texts.

Linguistic facets subsume two set of features: functional cues and syntactic
patterns. Functional cues are not completely new. Syntactic patterns, instead, 
have never been tried before in any automatic approach. Both functional cues
and syntactic patterns are linguistically-motivated features that can be 
interpreted functionally. The aim of a functional interpretation is to link 
linguistic features to the communicative situation which represents the external
context. The effort is to derive from text-internal linguistic cues the 
communicative context in which the text has been produced/consumed. The 
part of the communicative context we are interested in is the one related to
genre and text type. With linguistically-motivated and functionally-
interpretable features it is possible to combine qualitative analysis and
quantitative findings, and get a more accurate text analysis together with genre 
and text type identification.
Another advantage of linguistic facets is their corpus-independence. A
drawback of most of the automatic feature selection methods, -- when they 
work, cf. for example Copeck et al. (2000) -- is that they return subsets of 
features which are tailored to the corpus from where the features were 
extracted. Automatically selected features often “overfit”, which means that 
they are well-suited for the source corpus, but they cannot be easily exported to 
a corpus of different genres or text types, because their representativeness is 
lost (for an experience, see Santini 2005). Linguistic facets overcome this
problem. As they come from grammar books and represent common 
grammatical features, it is the variation in their distribution, or their mere
presence, that gives hints about their use across different kinds of texts. 
It is important to remind that the set of linguistic facets suggested here is only
an initial set that can be easily enlarged and enhanced in future. 
The report is organized as follows: Section 2 gives account of features used so 
far in genre and text type identification; Section 3 describes the resources used 
for the creation of linguistic facets; Section 4 provides a detailed breakdown of 
linguistic facets; Section 5 reports preliminary results of the performance of
linguistic facets in a classification task; Section 6 suggests the direction for 
future work.
2 Features Used So Far in Automatic Genre and Text 
Type Identification 
Only very few studies specifically comment on features which are useful for 
automatic genre and text type identification.
In the mid-80s Biber made a huge effort to collect 67 linguistically-motivated
features, mainly from socio-linguistic studies and from Quirk et al. (1985).  A 
thick Appendix in his Variation across speech and writing (Biber 1988) is dedicated 
to the description of these features, which were used with the multi-
4
dimensional approach, i.e. a quantitative, corpus-based approach based on 
factor analysis. Biber’s methodology is geared towards text type identification
Wolters and Kirsten (1999) investigated to what extent POS frequencies and 
content words are useful for both domain and genre classification in a German 
corpus. But their results were inconclusive. They suggested that the use of these 
two sets of features should be investigated separately. 
Dewdney et al. (2001) compared the performance of presentation features
(linguistic features and layout features) and word features (bag-of-words
approach) using three different classifiers (Naïve Bayes, C4.5 and SVM) over 
the Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) genre corpus. According to their results, 
the use of presentational features aided by some selected words is the most 
promising for genre classification. 
Following Argamon (1998), Santini (2004b) used POS trigrams to discriminate
across ten genres in the BNC. A Naïve Bayes classifier reached 87% accuracy
across ten genres -- conversation, interview, public debate, planned speech, academic
prose, advert, biography, instructional, popular lore, and reportage.
Other features were used for automatic genre and text type identification, 
namely:
specific verbs (Nakamura 1993, Wickberg 1993); relativisers (Sigley 1997) 
for text type identification; 
POSs (Karlgren and Cutting 1994); lexical cues, character level cues, 
ratios (Kessler et al. 1997); most frequent words in English and 
punctuation (Stamatatos et al. 2000) for automatic genre classification.
It is almost impossible to compare the results of these studies and draw any 
general conclusions about the best set of features, because different corpora,
different statistical approaches, different sets of genres and text types were used 
all the time.
3 Resources: Earlier Linguistic Work and Parser 
Linguistic facets are based on two main resources: earlier linguistic work and a 
NLP tool. The theoretical side of linguistic facets is based on four grammars
(Quirk et al. 1972; Werlich 1976, Quirk et al. 1985, Biber et al. 1988), and a 
corpus-based study on language variation (Biber 1988). The empirical side is 
based on the use of the parser Connexor (Tapanainen and Järvinen 1997). The 
motivation of the selection of these resources is given in the following 
subsections.
3.1 Linguistic Features and their Interpretation 
The set of linguistic facets suggested here includes only features that can be 
automatically extracted from a text. The design of linguistic facets relies on 
earlier linguistic works, namely: Werlich (1976), heavily based on Quirk et al. 
5
(1972); Quirk et al. (1985); Biber (1988), which draws many features from Quirk
et al. (1985); and Biber et al. (1999). These works have something in common: 
they provide an interpretation of the features according to different kinds of 
texts. Werlich (1976), Biber (1988) and Biber (1999) make this intent explicit. In 
Quirk et al (1972) and Quirk et al. (1985), instead, reference to the preferred use 
of some linguistic phenomena in different kind of texts is more occasional.
Werlich belongs to the German tradition of textlinguistik. His text grammar is a 
descriptive grammar, where claims are supported by examples from real texts, 
but it is not corpus-based (the corpus-based approach was not widespread in 
the mid-70s, especially outside the UK). As mentioned earlier, the linguistic and 
textual features described in Werlich (1976) are mainly taken from Quirk et al. 
(1972). The added value by Werlich is the description of the use of these 
features across five text types: description, narration, exposition, argumentation and 
instruction. He uses a somewhat peculiar terminology, not linked to the English-
speaking linguistic tradition, and hypothesizes “five dominant contextual foci 
that can be observed in all texts” (Werlich 1976: 19): a spatial focus or context 
for descriptive texts; a temporal focus or context for narrative texts; a focus on 
concepts for expository texts; a focus on relations between concepts for 
argumentative texts; a focus on future behaviour for instructional texts.  His text 
grammar is based on the hypothesis that texts are “conceived of as assignable to 
text types [and] primarily derive their structural distinctions from innate
cognitive properties” (Werlich 1976: 21). In his view, the five basic text types 
reflect the basic cognitive processes of contextual organization: description
relates to perception in space; narration is linked to perception in time; exposition 
depends on the comprehension of general concepts; argumentation relies on 
judging; instruction is based on planning.
The contribution of Werlich’s text grammar is that it provides breakdowns of 
linguistic and textual features for each text type. These features have the 
potential to be useful for any automatic genre and text type identification. Only
a restricted set of features have been drawn from Werlich’s grammar, namely 
the phenomenon sentences (see Subsection 4.5), i.e. simple sentence patterns
specific to the five text types. 
While Werlich’s text types derive from a cognitive interpretation of texts in 
relation to text producer, text receiver(s), external context and so on, Biber’s text
types are corpus-based, statistically extracted with factor analysis and 
interpreted in terms of "textual dimensions" (Biber 1988: 104 ff.). From a corpus
of 23 genres, he computes the frequencies of 67 linguistically-motivated
features, derived from sociolinguistic studies and from Quirk et al. (1985), and 
extracts 7 factors. He suggests interpretive labels for each factor (except Factor 
7, which seems to be not sufficiently representative) and ends up with 6 
dimensions: informational vs. involved production; narrative vs. non-narrative 
concerns; explicit vs. situation-dependent reference; overt expression of persuasion;
abstract vs. non-abstract information; online informational elaboration. His text types
cut across genres (Biber 1988: 129 ff.). They are statistically validated by a 
6
confirmatory cluster analysis and claimed to be representative for the English
language (Biber 1989). Nowadays they look too corpus-dependent and too 
subjective to be representative for English. However, the linguistic analysis 
brought about by Biber’s work remains a remarkable contribution to linguistics. 
Biber (1988) dedicates a whole chapter (Chapter 2) to the communicative
functions served by linguistic features. In a useful table, it outlines all the 
functions related to linguistic features (Biber 1988: 35). This functional 
interpretation of linguistic elements is entirely incorporated into Biber et al. 
(1999: 41-44). Biber et al. (1999) (with its useful student book) is entirely corpus-
based. The LSWE Corpus (the Longman Spoken and Written English Corpus)
contains over 40 million words of text (Biber et al. 1999: 24). It has been
constructed to provide a representation of different registers, namely: 
conversation, fiction, news, and academic prose. Each grammatical feature is 
described across the four registers following a regular structure: first a 
description of the grammatical feature in question; then a section called ‘Corpus 
Findings’ where the distributional patterns of the grammatical features are 
shown; finally a section called ‘Discussion of the Findings’ where the discourse
patterns described quantitatively are illustrated and interpreted in functional
terms (Biber et al. 1999: 41). This grammar represents a linguistic resource to be 
mined for decades. 
Quirk et al. (1972) is used here mostly in an indirect way, but it is important 
because it is the foundation of Werlich (1976). 
Quirk et al. (1985) is an invaluable descriptive grammar for English, which is
only partially corpus-based (Quirk et al. 1985: 33). It is interspersed by remarks
about formality and other situational dimensions reflected into the language.
For example, for a construction such as the "verbless temporal clause with until
in final position", as in Beat the mixture until fluffy, is “common in 
instructional texts” (Quirk et al. 1985: 1079).
3.2 The parser
In proposing linguistic facets for genre and text type identification, we wish to 
take full advantage of the linguistic knowledge returned by a parser. Ideally, 
with our approach many different parsers outputting complementary
information could be used for analysing the same text. In this first version of 
linguistic facets, we only use one parser, i.e. Connexor by Tapanainen and 
Järvinen (1997).
Connexor is based on a functional grammar, and outputs the baseform, or 
lemma, and four kinds of annotation: syntactic relations, functional tags
(starting with @), syntactic tags (starting with %), and morphological tags, which
do not show any special prefix.
This is an example of the output of the sentence The cat is on the mat:

4 Linguistic Facets
The following subsections describe the initial set of linguistic facets for genre 
and text type identification: 41 functional cues and 25 syntactic patterns. Both 
subsets are extracted from the output of Connexor, except most of the 
connectives, which are drawn from unparsed text. 
4.1 Linguistic Facets (I): Functional Cues 
Functional cues are mainly based on functional tags (i.e. tags starting with an @
sign according to Connexor annotation scheme, for example @SUBJ), to a minor 
extent on syntactic relations (for example, loc:> or tmp:>), and on a number of 
base forms or lemmas (for example, the base forms of semantic classes of verbs).
Connectives are extracted from unparsed text and ambiguities are solved with 
the help of punctuation marks. 
The list of functional cues included in this first set of linguistic facets is shown 
in Figure 1. For each of them, a short description is provided together with the
annotation tags or base forms used in the extraction process:
1. predicators 15. instrument markers
2.complex NPs 16. manner markers
3.  nominals 17. negative particles
4. first person 18. probability markers 
5. second person 19. necessity markers
6. third person 20. existential there 
7. third person singular inanimate 21. expressiveness 
8. present tense group 22. activity verbs 
9. past tense group 23. communication verbs 
10. imperatives 24. mental verbs 
11. active 25. causative verbs 
12. passive 26. occurrence verbs 
13. time markers 27. existence verbs
14. location markers 28. aspectual verbs

29. enumerative connectives 36. reformulatory connectives 
30. equative connectives 37. replacive connectives
31. reinforcing connectives 38. antithetic connectives 
32. summative connectives 39. concessive connectives 
33. appositive connectives 40. discoursal connectives 
34. resultative connectives 41. temporal connectives
35. inferential connectives 
Figure 2. List of funcional cues.
Predicators. This facet includes verbs in any roles, from auxiliary to finite or non-finite 
forms, to –ing forms. An extensive use of verbs is usually connected to an interactive
and affective purpose (Biber 1988: 105). In particular, verbs are extremely common in 
conversational genres (such as interviews or debates), because spoken genres often 
have a high number of short sentences, to keep the listeners' attention alert. Usually the 
level of syntactic complexity is very low since each sentence expresses a single main 
idea. Verbs are also used to show the speaker's attitudes, with elements such as: I think,
I know, etc. (Biber et al. 1999: 359-360).
@+FAUXV # finite auxiliary predicator
# Ex: This will cause a soft boot in the emulator.
@-FAUXV # nonfinite auxiliary predicator 
  # Ex: Software can be split roughly into two main types.
@+FMAINV # finite main predicator 
  # Ex: Sockets form the interface between these two components.
@-FMAINV # nonfinite main predicator 
  # Ex: If you are running the DOS emulator, go to the main window.
@<P-FMAINV" # nonfinite clause as preposition complement 
  # Ex: This mechanism is used for creating a virtual connection.
Complex NPs. The basic structure of the noun-headed phrase includes four major
components, two of which are optional: determiner + (pre-modification) + head noun + 
(post-modification and complementation). Overall, noun phrases with a modifier are
relatively rare in conversational genres, while they are common in press genres and 
academic genres (Biber et al. 1999: 574 ff.). 
@SUBJ who@SUBJ 
Ex: anyone who is willing to listen. 
@NH _that@SUBJ 
Ex: a market system that has no imperfections.

Ex: the industrially advanced countries. 
Nominals. This facet includes nouns, prepositional phrases, adjectives, appositions, and 
other elements that expand or enrich the meaning expressed by the noun. High 
frequency of nouns indicates density of information (Biber 1988: 105). Prepositional 
phrases integrate other pieces of information into a text, while adjectives and other 
elements further elaborate nominal information. The nominal component is very high
in academic genres (Biber et al. 1999: 235) and informational texts (Biber 1988: 104). 
@APP # Apposition 
  # Ex: John, your brother, came yesterday.
@NH # Stray noun phrase 
  # Ex: The house beside the church.
@A> # Premodifier of a nominal 
  # Ex: These sophisticated algorithms are stored safely.
@DN # Determiner 
  # Ex: The optical laser is a useful tool for eye treatment.
@<NOM-OF # Postmodifying prepositional phrase beginning with "of"
  # Ex: This will cause a soft boot of the emulator.
@<NOM # Postmodifier of a nominal 
# Ex: This mechanism is used for creating a connection between
the two components.
@<P # Other preposition complement 
  # Ex: This will leave the rest of the system running.
@OBJ # Object 
  # Ex: This will leave the rest of the system running.

@SUBJ # Subject 
  # Ex: Software can be split into several categories.
@PCOMPL-S # Subject complement 
  # Ex: Biscuits which are sugar-free, or nearly so.
@PCOMPL-O # Object complement 
  # Ex: This procedure makes the flow transparent to the user.
@QN> # Premodifying quantifier 
  # Ex: This process takes less than 1000 milliseconds.
@VOC # Vocative 
# Ex: Just do it, John!
First person. This facet comprises first person singular and plural pronouns, including
possessives and reflexives. When there is a high frequency of first person pronouns in a 
text, the communication context appear to be related to the text producer(s) (Werlich 
1976: 135, 137). First person pronouns are used in all subjective genres such as 
comments and opinions. 
PRON PERS SG1 # Personal pronouns, singular
# I, me, myself, my, mine.
PRON PERS PL1 # Personal pronouns, plural 
# we, us, ourselves, our, ours.
Second person. This facet comprises second person pronouns, including possessives 
and reflexives. When there is a high frequency of second person pronouns in a text, the 
communication context appear to be related to the text receiver(s) (Werlich 1976: 136). 
Second person pronouns are used in instructional genres and in conversational genres. 
you
yourself
yourselves
your
yours
Third person. This facet comprises third person singular and plural pronouns,
including possessives and reflexives. When there is a high frequency of third person 
pronouns in a text, the communication context appear to be related to persons in the
spatio-temporal context outside the producer-receiver communication process (Werlich 
1976: 136). Third person pronouns are widespread in all genres (Connexor does not 
have a tag for third person pronouns).

Third person singular inanimate. This facet comprises the pronoun it, including
possessives and reflexives (Werlich 1976: 137). Third person pronouns are used in all 
genres and often indicate an objective or impersonal point of view.

it subj:> # it in the subject position 
  # Ex: It strikes me.
# but not Make it softer.

Present tense group. This facet focuses on present tense, but comprises also present 
perfect and future. The present group is usually used in description, exposition,
argumentation and instruction (Werlich 1976:144). It is less common in narration. 
@+FMAINV %VA V PRES # Simple present 
# Ex: It rains; I usually eat salad; etc.
have main:>0  @+FMAINV %VA V PRES # have as main verb 
      # Ex: I have lunch with him.

# Ex: I have developed a system;

      # Ex: She is nice; He is a sailor; etc.

# Ex: You will see her later.
shall.*?@+FAUXV %AUX V AUXMOD # Future tense 
      # Ex: I shall go tomorrow.
Past tense group. This facet focuses on past tense, but comprises also present and past 
perfect (Werlich 1976: 144). Narrative texts show high frequencies of verbs in the past 
group.
@+FMAINV %VA V PAST # Simple past 
      # Ex: I visited him yesterday.
had.*?@+FAUXV %AUX V # Past perfect
# Ex: I had developed a system;
Imperatives. This facet includes only imperatives. According to Biber  et al. (1999), the 
frequent use of imperatives is more common in conversation than in writing. The
frequent use of imperatives in conversation is due to the fact that the situation is
interactive, "with participants often involved in some sort of non-linguistic activity at 
the moment of speaking. In such situations, it is natural to use language for the
purposes of monitoring the actions of the addressee" Biber  et al. (1999: 221). 
Imperatives are also widespread in instructional genres (Werlich 1976: 265), and 
persuasive genres. 
%VA V IMP # Imperative 
   # Ex: Eat it up!
Active. The active voice basically presents changes. The subject is usually viewed as an 
agent, affecting the external context. (Werlich 1976: 147). The active voice is the normal 
choice in many genres (Biber 1999: 475 ff). 
%VA # Active voice 
12
   # Ex: We describe the experiment in following section.
Passive. In the passive voice, the subject is usually viewed as a recipient affected by 
something coming from the external context. It can also be used in objective genres to
introduce impersonal third person point of view. In some genres, the passive voice is
frequently used for preserving anonymity (for example, in instructions) or to suggest
general validity for opinions (for example, in comments) (Werlich 1976: 148). 
%VP   # Passive voice
   # Ex: The experiment is described in following section.
agt # Agent 
# Ex: The dog was chased by the boys. 
Time markers are connected to narrative genres (Werlich 1976: 19, 39). 
dur:>   # Duration
   # Ex: This was done in the last 25 years.
frq:>   # Frequency
   # Ex: It often involves the use of an additional tool.
tmp:>   # Time
   # Ex: When you leave, shut the door.
Location markers are connected to descriptive genres (Werlich 1976: 19, 39). 
loc:>   # Location
   # Ex: This was done in the USA.
sou:>   # Source
   # Ex: He will move from home very soon. 
pth:>   # Path
   # Ex: He travelled from Stockholm to Rome.
Instrument marker indicates the items used to undertake a task. It is connected with 
instrumental genres (Werlich 1976: 268). 
ins:>   # Instrument
   # Ex: He sliced the bread with an electric knife.
Manner marker indicates the way in which something is done. It is connected to
descriptive and instrumental genres (Werlich 1976: 268). 
man:>.*?@ADVL # Manner
   # Ex: He cooks poorly.
Negative particles. Negative forms are much more common in conversation than in 
writing for several reasons. For example, verbs are more widespread in conversational
genres and negation is often linked to verbs (Biber et al. 1999: 159). Negative particles
13
are also quite common in argumentation, where they are used to highlight the 
contrastive stance in the reasoning process. 
NEG-PART # Negative particle 
   # Ex: They are not coming; They aren’t coming.
Probability markers mark “some aspect of the reasoning process” (Biber 1988: 241). 
They are common in argumentation (Werlich 1976: 262).

might
Probability markers mark “reliability” (Biber 1988: 241). They are common in 
instructional and persuasive genres.

Existential there can have two functions. On the one hand, it can be considered as static, 
therefore informational, since it precludes the presence of an active verb. For example, 
in There were thousands of glasses on the table. In this role, it is often used in
descriptive genres (Werlich 1976: 217). On the other hand, it can be used in non-
complex constructions, to reduce the informational load, and therefore might be more
common in conversational genres (Biber 1988: 228).
@F-SUBJ %NH <Ex> # Existential “there” 
    # Ex: There are interesting events coming soon. 
Expressiveness includes interjections and superlatives, elements that are typical of the 
hyperbolic style that can be found in advertisements and some other persuasive genres. 
INTERJ # Interjection 
    # Ex: Hey, who do you think you are?
SUP # Superlative 
    # Ex: The highest mountains in the world. 
Activity verbs primarily denote actions and events that can be associated with a choice,
and therefore take a subject with the semantic role of agent (Biber et al. 1999: 361, 366). 
These verbs are very common in instructional genres, but also in conversational genres.

Mental verbs denote a wide range of activities and states experienced by humans. They 
do not involve physical action and do not necessarily entail volition. Their subject often 
has the semantic role of recipient. They include both cognitive meaning and emotional 
meaning. They are common in conversational genres (Biber et al. 1999: 362, 366). The list

Connectives are conjunctive adverbs not integrated in the clause structure that indicate
a linkage between what has just been said and what was said before (Werlich 1976: 201).
According to Werlich, different sequences of conjunctive adverbs mark different text 
types (Werlich 1976: 167, 202). For example, appositive, reformulatory, discoursal and
16
reinforcing connectives are used in expository and instructional genres. Here the
different classes of connectives have been taken from Quirk et al. (1985: 634 ff.). A 
description of their roles in different kind of text can be found in Werlich (1976: 167-
179).

4.2 Linguistic Facets (II): Syntactic patterns 
The idea that certain genres or writing styles favour certain syntactic constructions is 
not new (Biber 1988: 229-230; Baayen et al. 1996; Stamatatos et al. 2001, etc.). However, 
even if syntax is acknowledged to have discriminating power, (though sometimes 
reluctantly Aaronson 1999), it has often been neglected in genre categorization studies, 
because the extraction of syntactic features is considered to be computationally 
expensive and time-consuming (Kessler et al. 1997). The 67 linguistic features selected
by Biber more than 15 years ago (Biber 1988: 73-75, 221-245) are based mainly on word 
identification, even when the features are really syntactic, because NLP tools were quite 
limited at that time. For example, the identification of adverbial clauses is based on the 
presence of specific subordinators, such as although and though for concessive clauses,
and because for causative clauses. However, the lexically-based approach to syntax is 
18
quite limited, because subordinators can be ambiguous. To overcome the ambiguity 
issue, Biber used only unambiguous subordinators; for example because is the only
causative subordinator included in his features, being the only one "to function 
unambiguously as a causative adverbial. Other forms, such as as, for and since, can have
a range of functions, including causative" (Biber 1988: 236). POS trigrams (which are 
considered to be a light surrogate of syntactic information) have strong discriminating
power, but they are corpus dependent (see Argamon et al 1998 and Santini 2004 for POS
trigrams extraction methods) and they do not help in the qualitative analysis of a text. 
We suggest that the creation and detection of syntactic patterns from a text can
represent a useful alternative to the previous approaches to syntax extraction. 
4.2.1 Methodology: Creation or Detection of Syntactic Patterns 
Syntactic pattern creation and detection involves the following steps:
1. Copying examples of subordinate clauses or sentence types from grammars (namely 
Werlich 1976; Quirk et al. 1985; Biber et al. 1999) into single files, one file for each 
syntactic construction.
2. Parsing the files containing the examples of syntactic constructions.
3. Tabulation of the parses in a convenient form, more specifically restoring the
horizontal alignment from the Connexor vertical output (see Steps 2 and 3 below). 
4. Creation of a set of patterns for each syntactic construction by identifying the
common elements of the parses for each syntactic construction and replacing the
optional elements with regular expressions. 
5. Creation of an algorithm to identify the sets of patterns in running texts. 
Figure 3. Pipeline for syntactic pattern creation and detection.
All the steps will be illustrated taking the creation and the detection of some patterns of
the concessive clause.
Step 1: Grammars as a corpus of examples: Concessive Clause
The examples of clause of concession were copied into a file from Quirk et al. (1985: 
1097-1102) and Biber et al. (1999: 818-827). 
Step 2: Parsing 
The file was parsed in Connexor and a parse was returned for each example (wrong 
parses were not used to build patterns). 
For instance, the sentence: 
<!-- : Although he had just joined the company, he was treated exactly like 
all the other employees.--> 
was parsed as follows: 
19
1 Although although pm:>5 @CS %CS CS 
2 he he subj:>3 @SUBJ %NH PRON PERS NOM SG3 
3 had have v-ch:>5 @+FAUXV %AUX V PAST 
4 just just meta:>5 @ADVL %EH ADV 
5 joined join cnd:>11 @-FMAINV %VA EN 
6 the the det:>7 @DN> %>N DET 
7 company company obj:>5 @OBJ %NH N NOM 
8 , ,
9 he he subj:>10 @SUBJ %NH PRON PERS NOM SG3 
10 was be v-ch:>11 @+FAUXV %AUX V PAST 
11 treated treat main:>0 @-FMAINV %VP EN 
12 exactly exactly man:>11 @ADVL %EH ADV 
13 like like @ADVL %EH PREP 
14 all all det:>15 @DN> %>N DET 
15 the the det:>16 @DN> %>N DET 
16 other other attr:>17 @DN> %>N DET 
17 employees employee @NH %NH N NOM PL 
18 . .
19 <s> <s>
Figure 4. A sentence parsed by Connexor.
Step 3: Creating the patterns
As described earlier, Connexor returns several types of annotation. For the creation of
syntactic patterns, the priority was given to functional annotation, i.e. the annotation 
starting with an @ sign, occasionally integrated by other types of annotation, for 
example the syntactic relation main:> that identifies the main verb in the whole 
sentence, or lexical items, such  as although, to represent subordinators. A simple
algorithm based on string manipulation clears out all unnecessary information and 
returns the following pattern for the sentence of the example: 
<!-- : Although he had just joined the company, he was treated exactly like 
all the other employees.--> 
although@CS @SUBJ have@FAUXV @ADVL FMAINV_EN @DN> @OBJ , @SUBJ be@FAUXV 
main_FMAINV_EN @ADVL @ADVL @DN> @DN> @DN> @NH
Reading such a pattern is very easy: 
although@CS = ‘although’ in the role of subordinate conjunction 
@SUBJ = subject of the clause 
have@FAUXV = ‘have’ as auxiliary 
@ADVL   = adverb
FMAINV_EN = past participle 
@DN>   = determiner
@OBJ   = object
20
be@FAUXV = ‘be’ as auxiliary 
main_FMAINV = main verb in the sentence 
@ADVL   = adverb
@NH   = noun head
Step 4: Manual Identification of common elements across patterns
What are the common elements between the two following patterns? 
Sentence 1:
<!-- : Although he had just joined the company, he was treated exactly like 
all the other employees.--> 
although@CS @SUBJ have@FAUXV @ADVL FMAINV_EN @DN> @OBJ , @SUBJ be@FAUXV 
main_FMAINV_EN @ADVL @ADVL @DN> @DN> @DN> @NH
Sentence 2:
<!-- : Although Sam had told the children a bedtime story, June told them one 
too. --> 
although@CS @SUBJ have@FAUXV FMAINV_EN @DN> @I-OBJ @DN> @A> @OBJ , @SUBJ 
main_FMAINV_PAST @I-OBJ @OBJ @ADVL
It’s very easy to detect: both start with ‘although’, both have a subject followed by a
verb in the subordinate clause, both have a subject and a main verb in the matrix clause. 
The common elements are:
although@CS @SUBJ FMAINV @SUBJ main_FMAINV 
In order to make this pattern flexible and open to any number of optional elements 
occurring between each component, we can simply use regular expressions (provided 
by many programming languages from Perl to Java, Javascript, Python, etc. The use of
regular expression is well-explained in Friedl 1997). The use of a ‘non-greedy’ quantifier 
(i.e. a quantifier that finds the minimum number of character matching the pattern) 
makes the algorithm more efficient. In many cases, the metacharacters *? are enough to
meet the need of flexibility. The pattern filled in by regular expressions has the
following form:
although@CS.*?@SUBJ.*?FMAINV.*?@SUBJ.*?main_FMAINV
and matches both examples of sentences containing a concessive clause. 
Step 5: Creation of an algorithm to identify patterns in running texts 
This procedure was repeated for all the examples representing the subordinate clauses 
and simple sentence types. For each subclause type and for each simple sentence type a
set of patterns was built, and a straightforward algorithm to detect them in running 
texts was created. Each set of patterns was searched by a subroutine, as in the snippet 
below . 
21
Figure 5. Example of a subroutine written in Perl to detect the syntactic patterns of concessive clause.
Why not use machine learning? 
In a preliminary experiment, we tried to make a classifier to learn a number of patterns
but the results were not very encouraging. Features in the dataset were represented by
Connexor functional tags or syntactic relations, and data were represented by 
frequencies of occurrence.
For example, the complex noun phrase the industrially advanced countries with
the pattern DN> AD-A> A> NH <s>  was represented by a record with following format: 
A> +FMAINV -FAUXV -FMAINV <AD-A <NOM DN> <P NH etc. 
1      0      0      0     1      0   1   0  1
Figure 6. Snippet of a record representing a syntactic pattern.
12 syntactic constructions were selected for the learning task: 
Modifier + Noun Phrase
Verb + that-clause
ADJective + that-clause
that-omission
that-retention
Verb + wh-clause
V + inf-clause
V + ing-clause
ADJective + ing-clause
Linking Adverbials
Circumstance Adverbials
Existential There
The training corpus comprised 108 labelled sentences and the test corpus 12 sentences, 
one per category. The learning situation was extremely favourable, nonetheless, using 
syntactic patterns made of functional tags, the results were the following:

 Figure 8. Classification accuracy with syntactic relations. 
Syntactic patterns made of syntactic relations can achieve an accuracy of 75% with a 
decision tree classifier. But as noted earlier, the proportion of the training set makes the 
situation extremely favourable. It appears that a machine learning approach is not 
advisable if the aim is only to work out the frequencies of subordinate clauses or other 
sentence types.  First, it is not straightforward to represent the linearity of a string in a 
classifier. The position of a tag or a word is very important in syntax. The experiment 
above does not take into account the position of the tag, only the presence and the 
frequency of it in sentence. The position could be incorporated in the vector, but this 
would lead to a huge feature space. Of course, it would be possible (see Mitchell 1997: 
180 ff.) but the preparation of the vector would be quite complex. Furthermore, 
evaluating a threshold for the reliability of the predictions returned by the classifier 
would be an additional problem. Also, multiple classifications of a single sentence (a 
sentence can include several subordinate clauses) represent another hard tasks to tackle 
with machine learning. 
Advantages of syntactic patterns 
The algorithms for creating syntactic patterns from a parser output and their detection 
in running texts are very easy, straightforward and fast. A syntactic pattern can return 
lots of syntactic information about main clauses, complement clauses and adverbial 
clauses. Also unusual constructions, like the following, can be easily identified, without 
creating any noise:
Naked as I was, I braved the storm. 
@PCOMPL-S as@CS @SUBJ be_FMAINV , @SUBJ main_FMAINV @DN> @OBJ 
In this pattern, there is a subject complement, followed by as in the role of conjunction,
followed by a subject, followed by a verb be, followed by another subject, followed by a 
main verb, and so on. 
With syntactic patterns, we can also detect the position of the subclause in a sentence. 
The position of a subclause in a sentence can provide hints about registers/genres (see 
subsections below). 
Some subordinators can be easily disambiguated, for example though:
No goals were scored, though it was an exciting game. 
@DN> @SUBJ @FAUXV main_FMAINV , though@CS @SUBJ FMAINV @DN> @A> @PCOMPL-S
It cannot be confused with:
He went, though
even if the parser makes a tagging mistake.
Furthermore, several subordinate clauses can be identified in a single sentence. For
example:
Although Sam had told the children a bedtime story, June told them one too,
because she was eager to see their reaction. 
both patterns:
although@CS @SUBJ.*?FMAINV.*? , @SUBJ.*?main_FMAINV 
and
SUBJ.*?FMAINV.*?because@CS.*?SUBJ.*?FMAINV
are applicable,  therefore the sentence is fully analysed as bearing a concessive clause in 
initial position and a reason clause in final position. 
4.3 Adverbial clauses
Syntactic patterns for the following subclauses were created. According to Biber et al.
(1999: 831), final position is the unmarked choice for non-finite adverbial clauses in all
registers. All the syntactic forms of non-finite clauses and all semantic categories 
typically occur in final position. It is interesting to see which genres or text types,
instead, have preferences for the initial position.
1. concession clause (initial,  final, special) 
2. conditional clause (initial, final, special) 
3. contrast clause 
4. exception clause 
5. purpose clause 
6. reason clause (initial, final) 
7. result clause 
8. similarity manner comparison clause
9. space clause (initial, final) 
10. time clause (initial, final, incidental, instruct.)
Figure 9. List of adverbial clauses.
24
Legend for the syntactic patterns:
CS=subordinating conjunction; 
SUBJ=subject of the clause; 
FMAINV=a verb in a clause; 
FMAINV_EN=past participle;
FAUX=auxiliary;
main=the main verb in the sentence. It is located in the matrix clause 
$s_v_main=SUBJ.*?main_FMAINV (i.e., a subject followed by the main verb of
the sentence); 
^=beginning of the string; 
*?=non greedy quantifier, it stops at the first occurrence of the following
string. It is useful to override all the optional elements in a clause, such 
as adverbs, adjectives, and so on. 
Concession clauses (initial, final, special1) indicate that the situation in the main clause 
is contrary to expectations expressed in the concessive clause (Quirk et al. 1097-1098). 
Clauses of concession are introduced chiefly by although or its more informal variant 
though. Other subordinators used with concessive clauses are: if, even if, even though, 
when, whereas (formal), while, and whilst. There are also special constructions, i.e. unusual
syntactic ordering when the subordinators are as and though in formal style, as in 
Genius though she was, she was quite unassuming. Concession my also be expressed 
by several prepositional phrases followed by a relative clauses (despite, in spite of, 
irrespective of, regardless of, notwithstanding). They are considered to be stylistically
clumsy (Quirk et al. 1985: 1098). The position of the subordinate clause and punctuation 
marks can help disambiguate ambiguous subordinators. For example, ambiguity
between concessive when and temporal when can be lowered with the help of a comma: 
concessive when is always in final position, often after a comma: She paid, when she
could have entered free (*When she could have entered free, she paid), while 
temporal when is more integrated with the main clause: She was shocked when she
heard the story (*She was shocked,  when she heard the story; When she heard
the story, she was shocked). Concessive clauses are widely used in argumentation 
and argumentative genres (Werlich 1976: 260). 
CONCESSIVE CLAUSE, INITIAL POSITION
although@CS.*?SUBJ.*?FMAINV.*?$s_v_main
Ex: Although he had just joined the company, he was treated exactly like all 
the other employees 
though@CS.*?@NH , .*?$s_v_main 
Ex: Though well over eighty, he can walk faster than I can. 
even though@CS.*?SUBJ.*?FMAINV.*?$s_v_main 
Ex: Even though you dislike ancient monuments, Warwick Castle is worth a 
visit.
1 The labels "initial", "final", "special" indicate respectively initial position in a sentence, final 
position in a sentence, and special or unusual syntactic construction of the subclause. 
25
even though@CS.*?@FMAINV_EN.*?$s_v_main 
Ex: Even though given every opportunity, they would not cooperate with us. 
even if@CS.*?SUBJ.*?FMAINV.*?$s_v_main 
Ex: Even if you dislike ancient monuments, Warwick Caste is worth a visit. 
whereas@CS.*?SUBJ.*?FMAINV.*? , .*?$s_v_main 
Ex: Whereas the amendment is enthusiastically supported by a large majority 
in the Senate, its fate is doubtful in the House. 
The initial position of whereas disambiguates the concessive clause from the  contrast 
clause. Usually in the contrast clause, whereas is in final position: I ignore them, 
whereas my hushand is worried of what they think of us.
CONCESSIVE CLAUSE, FINAL  POSITION
$s_v_main.*?although@CS.*?SUBJ.*?FMAINV
Ex: He was treated exactly like all the other employees, although he had just 
joined the company. 
$s_v_main.*?_though@CS.*?SUBJ.*?FMAINV
Ex: He can walk faster than I can, though he is over eighty.
$s_v_main.*?even though@CS.*?SUBJ.*?FMAINV 
Ex: they would not cooperate with us, even though given every opportunity. 
$s_v_main.*?even if@CS.*?SUBJ.*?FMAINV 
Ex: Warwick Caste is worth a visit, even if you dislike ancient monuments.
CONCESSIVE CLAUSE, SPECIAL CONSTRUCTIONS

Ex: Fail though I did, I would not abandon my goal 
@PCOMPL-S_A _as@CS @SUBJ FMAINV.*? , .*?$s_v_main 
Ex: Naked as I was, I braved the storm 
Conditional clauses (initial, final, special) mainly express a condition. The two simple 
subordinators for conditional clauses are if and unless (Quirk et al. 1985: 1088 ff.). Other 
subordinators are: as long as, so long as, assuming that, given that (formal), in case, in the 
event that, just so that (informal), on condition that, provided that, providing that, supposing 
that. According to Biber et al. (1999: 833), conditional clauses have different positional 
distributions across registers, and in written registers, there is a slight preference for the 
initial position. Special conditional constructions are represented by verbless clauses 
with with or without, as in Without me to supplement your income, you wouldn't be
able to manage, or With them on our side, we are secure. Another formal
construction is the one with subject inversion : Had Mark been in charge, it
wouldn't have happened. All these patterns can be easily extracted in an automatic 
way. If can be both concessive and conditional. As we did not manage to disambiguate
it for the time being, we assume that it is always conditional, also because concessive if

used in instruction and instructional genres (Werlich 1976: 260), but also in
argumentation.

Contrast clauses are introduced by several subordinators that introduce also concessive 
clauses (Quirk et al. 1985: 1102): whereas, while (also temporal) and whilst. The
contrastive meaning may be emphasized by in contrast and by contrast when the 
contrastive clause is initial. While concessive while is always in initial position, as in 
While he has many friends, Peter is lonely, temporal while can be in both positions: 
initial position, as in While I was asleep, I dreamt of you; or final position without a
comma, as in They arrived while I was sunbathing. Contrast clauses controlled by 
while in final position are very unambiguous in this respect, because they always follow 
a comma, as in: John teaches physics, while Mary teaches chemistry (*They
arrived, while I was sunbathing).
$s_v_main.*?, while.*?SUBJ.*?FMAINV 
Ex: Mr Larson teaches physics, while Mr Corby teaches chemestry. 
cf. the concessive pattern for 'whereas' above. 
$s_v_main.*?, whereas.*?SUBJ.*?FMAINV 
Ex: I ignore them, whereas my husband is always worried about what they think 
of us. 
Exception clauses are introduced by several subordinators: but that (formal), except that;
less frequently excepting that and save that (formal) (Quirk et al. 1985: 1102). They seem 
to occur only in final position. 
$s_v_main.*?except@CS.*?SUBJ.*?FMAINV

Ex: Nothing would satisfy the child but for me to place her on my lap. 
SUBJ.*?never.*?FMAINV.*?but.*@CC.*?SUBJ.*?FMAINV
Ex: It never rains but it pours. 
Purpose clauses are more often infinitival than finite. More explicit subordinators of
purpose are in order to (formal) and so as to. Finite clauses of purpose are introduced by 
so that  or (less commonly and more informally) by so, and (more formally) by in order
that (Quirk et al. 1985: 1107). Purpose clause are syntactically very similar to infinitival
nominal clause (I wished to go home vs. I left early to catch the train). A way
of disambiguating them at a syntagmatic level is to use lexicalized verbs, because all 
complement/nominal clauses are controlled by restricted sets of verbs (Biber et al 1999: 
28
29
700 ff.). Purpose clauses are widely used in instruction and instructional genres 
(Werlich 1976: 266).

The first group of parentheses is used to check that the main verb of the sentence is not
one of the verbs supporting infinitival “to”, for example want, wish, and so on (the full 
list has been taken from Biber et al. (1999: 700-705) and Quirk et al. (1985: 1181 ff.). The 
algorithm checks that none of these verbs is in the part of the string between brakets. If 
so, the pattern is not matched.
The second group of parentheses is used to check that there are no subordinators 
between the main verb of the sentence and the infinitival tag (INFMARK). The algorithm 
checks that none of the subordinators used in for the syntactic pattern creation is in the 
part of the string between brackets. If so, the pattern is not matched.

Reason clauses (initial, final) include several types of subordinate clauses. For all types, 
the word 'reason' is a superordinate term (cause and effect; reason and consequence; 
motivation and result; circumstances and consequence) (Quirk et al. 1985: 1103 ff.). 
Reason clauses are most commonly introduced by the subordinators because and since.
Other subordinators are as and for (formal). Because is unambiguous, since can be also 
temporal.  However, temporal since comes always with present perfect in the matrix 
clause, while reason since does not (see the example below). For is disambiguated by the 
tag @CS, when it functions as subordinator. As (used for reason, similarity and time) 
cannot be disambiguated yet. Reason clauses in final position are the strong preference 
for conversational genres (Biber et al. 1999: 833). Reason clauses are widely used in 
exposition (Werlich 1976: 254) and argumentation (Werlich 1976: 260).

Ex: Since we live near the sea, we often go sailing. 
The group of parentheses is used to check that the verb in the matrix clause is not a 
present perfect or a past perfect. These forms are allowed in the matrix clause only 
when “since” is temporal, like in: Since they lived in London, they have been 
increasingly happy (Quirk et al. 1985: 538 ff.) , and not when it is causal.

SUBJ.*?FMAINV.*?since@CS.*?SUBJ(.*?)FMAINV
Ex: I lent him the money because he needed it. 
Result clauses are introduced by the subordinators so that (formal), and so. These 
clauses overlap with those of purpose both in meaning and in subordinators. The main 
semantic difference is that result clauses are factual and not putative, i.e. in result 
clauses the result is achieved, whereas in purpose clauses it is a desired result (Quirk et 
al. 1985: 1108 ff.). Therefore, clauses of result do not require a modal auxiliary (We paid 
him immediately, so he left contented), while purpose clauses often have one (We
paid him immediately so he would leave contented). Result clauses can only appear 
in final position. Unlike purpose clauses, result clauses introduced by so are separated 
by a comma (Quirk et al. 1985: 1109). Result clauses are widely used in description and 
descriptive genres (Werlich 1976: 254). 
$s_v_main.*? , _so@ADVL _that@CS.*?SUBJ(.*?)FMAINV 
Ex: We paid him immediately, so that he left content. 
$s_v_main.*? , _so@CS.*?SUBJ(.*?)FMAINV 
Ex: We paid him immediately, so he left content. 
The group of parentheses is used to check that the verb in the matrix clause is not a 
preceded by an auxiliary. 
Similarity, manner and comparison clauses are introduced by as and like (similarity 
and manner) and like (informal), as if, as though (comparison combined with manner) 
(Quirk et al. 1985: 1110-1111). Manner clauses are widely used in description and 
instruction (Werlich 1976: 267). 
as@CS.*?SUBJ.*?FMAINV.*? , _so@CS.*?$s_v_main 
Ex: As a moth is attracted by a light, so he was attracted by her.

Ex: She winked at me as if to say that I shouldn't say anything. 
$s_v_main.*?as though@CS.*?SUBJ.*?FMAINV 
Ex: She treated me as though I was a stranger. 
Space clauses (initial, final) are introduced mainly by where or wherever (Quirk et al. 
1985: 1087). They indicate position or direction. Space clauses are widely used in 
description (Werlich 1976: 254). 
SPACE CLAUSE, INITIAL POSITION

SPACE CLAUSE, FINAL POSITION
($s_v_main.*?)where.*?SUBJ.*?FMAINV
Ex 1: They went where they could find work. 
Ex 2: They went wherever they could find work. 
The group of parentheses is used to check that the main verb of the sentence is not one 
of the verbs supporting wh-clauses, as in the example: I want you to show me where 
the car went down. Otherwise, the pattern is not matched. 
Time clauses (initial, final, incidental, instructional) are introduced by one of the 
following subordinators: after, as, before, once, since, till, until, when whenever, while, whilst, 
now that, as long as, so long as, as soon as, immediately, directly. Adverbial -ing clauses of 
time are introduced by one of the following subordinators: once, till, until, when, 
whenever, while, whilst. Adverbial -ed clauses of time are introduced by one of the 
following subordinators that are also used with finite clauses: as soon as, once, till, until, 
when, whenever, whilst. Verbless clauses of time are introduced by the same 
subordinators as –ed clauses. Until and till in verbless clause are mainly used in 
instructional language (Quirk et al. 1985: 1079). -ing clauses without a subordinator or a 
subject may also express time relationship, as in Returning to my village after 15 
years, I met an old schoolteacher (see Quirk et al. 1985: 1078 ff.). Time clauses are 
widely used in narration (Werlich 1976: 256) and in instruction (Werlich 1976: 267).

4.4 Complement/Nominal Clauses
Complement clauses are a type of dependent clause used to complete the meaning of an
associated verb or adjective in a higher clause in the sentence. Complement clauses are
also called nominal clauses because they occupy a noun phrase slot. There are four
major structural types of complement clause: that-clause, wh-clause, to-infinitive clause,
ing-clause  (Biber et al. 1999: 658). Syntactic patterns for the following nominal clauses
were created, mainly on post-predicate position: 
1. verb+that clause 
2. adjective+that clause 
3. that omission 
4. wh-clause
5. verb+to clause
6. adjective+to clause 
7. verb+ing clause 
8. comparative clause 
9. relative clause 
Figure 10. List of nominal clauses.
In general, that-clauses in post-predicate position are commonly used to report speech, 
thoughts, attitudes, or emotions of humans (Biber et al. 1999: 661). They are also widely 
used in argumentation (Werlich 1976: 261). 
Verb+that clause. Verbs taking that complement clauses in post-predicate position fall 
into three semantic domains: mental verbs, speech act verbs, and other communication
verbs (Biber et al. 1999: 661). Post-predicate that-clauses after verbs are most common in 
conversational genres, and less common in academic genres (Biber et al. 1999: 674). 
main_FMAINV.*?_that@CS.*?SUBJ.*?FMAINV
Ex 1: They warned him that it's dangerous. 
Ex 2: He was told that she had checked out of the hospital. 
Adjective+that clause. The adjectives that control a that complement clause convey
stance, and fall into three major semantic domains: degree of certainty, affective
psychological states, and evaluation of situations, events, etc. (Biber et al. 1999: 671). 
Post-predicate that-clauses controlled by adjectival are most common in conversational 
genres (Biber et al. 1999: 674). 
PCOMPL-S_A _that@CS.*?SUBJ.*?FMAINV 
Ex: was quite confident that it would stay in very well. 
@<P _that@CS.*?$s_v_main 
33
Ex: It has been clear for some time that the demands of the arms control 
process would increasingly dominate military planning. 
that omission. According to Biber et al. 1999: 680 ff., there are a number of discourse
factors that influence the retention vs. omission of that. In conversation, the omission is
the norm, while in writing is the opposite. These distributional patterns correspond to
different production circumstances and communicative purposes.
SUBJ.*?main(.*?)SUBJ.*?FMAINV
Ex: I hope you realised they said a few words on there. 
be_main.*?@PCOMPL-S_A(.*?)SUBJ.*?FMAINV
Ex: I'm sure he was wrong. 
be_main.*?@PCOMPL-S_NOM(.*?)SUBJ.*?FMAINV
Ex: It's a pity you don't know Russian. 
FMAINV.*?FMAINV_EN(.*?)SUBJ.*?FMAINV
Ex: I'll do it provided you pay me. 
be@FAUXV.*?FMAINV_EN(.*?)SUBJ.*?FMAINV",
Ex: It was hoped by everybody she would sing. 
The group of parentheses in the patterns indicate that the part of strings between
brackets should not contain “that” or any other subordinators. If so, the pattern is not 
matched.
wh-clause. Wh-clauses can be either dependent interrogative clauses or nominal
relative clauses. Dependent interrogative clauses are used with verbs such as ask or 
wonder to ask an indirect question, as in I wonder what this is about. In contrast,
nominal relative clauses have a more complicated structure, as in Whoever sorts Eagle 
out will make a lot of money (Biber et al. 1999: 683 ff.). Wh-clauses are more common
in conversational genres (Biber et al. 1999: 688 ff.).

Ex: I want you to tell me when this happened. 
be_main.*?PCOMPL-S_A when*?SUBJ.*?FMAINV 
Ex: I'm not sure when it's open. 
Verb+to clause. The verbs taking to-clauses in post-predicate position can be grouped 
into a number of semantic classes (Biber et al. 1999: 693 ff.). According to Biber et 
al.(1999: 711), to-clauses in post-predicate position typically perform specific functions 
in different registers.
FMAINV.*?FMAINV.*?@INFMARK>.*?FMAINV
Ex: I'm just trying to get away early. 
I'm just trying to get away early. 
Adjective+to clause. Adjectival predicates controlling to-clauses come from a number 
of semantic domains (Biber et al. 1999: 718 ff.). Post-predicate to-clauses complementing 
an adjective are rare in conversational genres and common in press genres (Biber et al. 
1999: 722).
PCOMPL-S_A.*?@INFMARK>
Ex: Millar was obstinately determined to change the content of education. 
Verb+ing clauses are most commonly used in conjunction with an aspectual verb in the 
main clause (begin, start, stop), but they are also used to report speech acts, cognitive
states, perceptions, emotions, and various other actions. They are mostly located in 
35
post-predicate position (Biber et al. 1999: 739). Overall, -ing clauses in post-predicate
position are most common in the writing and least common in conversational genres 
(Biber et al. 1998: 749). 
FMAINV(.*?) FMAINV_ING 
Ex 1: I remember reading this book. 
Ex 2: They talk about building more.
Comparative clause. In a comparative construction, a proposition expressed in the 
main clause is compared with the proposition expressed in the subordinate clause 
(Quirk et al. 1985: 1127 ff.). The frequency of comparative clauses in academic writing 
reflects the importance of comparison as a means of understanding and explicating 
reality (Biber et al. 1999: 728-729.). Comparative clauses are also widely used in 
description and descriptive genres (Werlich 1976: 254). 
@SUBJ.*?main.*?@PCOMPL-S_CMP than@ADVL 
Ex: Jane is healthier than her sister. 
@SUBJ.*?main.*?@PCOMPL-S_A than@ADVL 
Ex: Mary is less old than Jane. 
@SUBJ.*?main.*?@OBJ @ADVL_CMP 
Ex: James enjoys the theatre more. 
@SUBJ.*?main.*?@AD-A_CMP @ADVL 
Ex: Time passed more quickly than last year. 
@SUBJ.*?main.*?_as@AD-A> @SUBJ _as@CS @SUBJ 
Ex: I agree with you as much as I can. 
@SUBJ.*?main.*?_as@AD-A> @PCOMPL-S_A _as@CS 
Ex: The article was as objective as I expected. 
@SUBJ.*?main.*?@PCOMPL-S_A _enough@<AD-A @INFMARK> 
Ex: You are old enough to look after yourself. 
@SUBJ.*?main.*?_enough@OBJ.*?@INFMARK>
Ex: She knows enough about the topic to explain it to you. 
Relative clauses. Restrictive/nominal relative clauses are different from sentential 
relative clauses. While restrictive/nominal relative clauses have a noun as antecedent, 
the sentential relative clause refers back to the predicate or to a whole sentence. For 
example, Things then improved, which surprises me is a sentential relative clause 
(Quirk et al. 1985: 1118) and I eat what I like is a restrictive relative clause (Quirk et
al. 1985: 1056).  In standard English, relative clauses can be formed using eight different
relativisers: which, who, whom, whose, that, where, when, why, plus a zero relitiviser. The 
choice among relativisers is influenced by a number of factors, for example register, 
restrictive vs. non-restrictive function, animate vs. non animate head. Restrictive 
relative clauses are widely used in description (Werlich 1976: 254) and exposition 
(Werlich 1976: 258). Relative clauses are currently extracted using two tags: 
<Rel>
Ex 1: She knows enough about the topic to explain it to you. 
Ex 2: They are delighted with the person who has been appointed. 
36
who@DN>
Ex: The woman whose daughter you met is Msr. Brown. 
4.5 Simple Sentences
In his text grammar for English, Werlich, among other things, lists six phenomenon
sentences (Werlich 1976: 216 ff.). According to his cognitive framework, all sentences in
the communication process interact with contextual factors of the spatio-temporal
environment. Against this referential context, all sentences are phenomenon sentences 
because the text producer emphasizes a type of phenomenon in the spatio-temporal
context. According to Werlich, when the frequency of one of these main clauses is very
high in a single text, the text is likely to belong to one of the five text type dealt with in
his text grammar. As noted earlier, Werlich's terminology does not belong to the 
English tradition. According to him, the English language provides the following six 
types of simple phenomenon sentences: 
1. phenomenon registering
2. action recording 
3. phenomenon identifying 
4. phenomenon linking 
5. quality attributing
6. action demanding 
Figure 11. Werlich's phenomenon sentences.
The phenomenon registering sentence is used with reference to phenomena in space. It 
is a simple subject-predicate-adverbial structure with an adverb of place. The 
adverb of place in the phenomenon registering sentence sets a spatial frame of reference 
within which the phenomena at the subject are placed, as in Thousands of glasses
were on the table. A variant of the phenomenon registering sentence is the pattern
with there followed by a verb form of be. Phenomenon registering sentences are 
widespread in description (Werlich 1976: 216-217). 
@SUBJ.*?main.*?loc_@ADVL_PREP
Ex: Thousands of pilgrims were on the road to London. 
@SUBJ.*?main.*?pth_@ADVL_PREP
Ex: Thousands of tourists moved to London.
@SUBJ.*?main.*?sou_@ADVL_PREP
Ex: Thousands of tourists moved away from London.
@F-SUBJ be_main.*?@PCOMPL-S_NOM 
Ex: There was a long queue of cars. 
The action recording sentence is used with reference to phenomena in time. It is a 
simple subject-predicate-adverbial-(adverbial) structure with adverbs of 
place and time. The adverb of time in the action recording sentence sets a temporal
frame of reference within which the phenomena at subject are placed, as in The
passengers landed in New York in the middle of the night. Action recording
sentences are widespread in narration  (Werlich 1976: 217).
SUBJ.*?main.*?tmp_@ADVL
Ex: He went home for Christmas. 
37
38
"SUBJ.*?main.*?frq_@ADVL",
Ex: he went back home often. 
SUBJ.*?main.*?dur_@ADVL
Ex: this happened in the first 25 years. 
cla_@ADVL_PREP @<P 
Ex: At 10, the engine started. 
The phenomenon identifying sentence is used with reference to phenomena in relation 
to concepts. It is a simple subject-predicate-complement structure with a verb 
form of be at predicate and a nominal group at complement, as in One part of the 
brain is the cortex. The nominal group at the complement identifies the 
phenomenon referred to in the nominal group at subject giving it a name, a class or a 
role. Phenomenon identifying sentences in the present are common in exposition 
(Werlich 1976: 217-218). 
@SUBJ be_main.*?@PCOMPL-S_NOM
Ex: These are nerve cells or neurones. 
The phenomenon linking sentence is used with reference to phenomena in part-of
relationship with other phenomena. It is a three element patterns, subject-
predicate-complement, with a verb form of have at predicate and a nominal group 
at the complement, as in The brain has ten million neurones. Phenomenon-linking 
sentences in the present tense are common in exposition (Werlich 1976: 218). 
SUBJ have_main.*?OBJ 
Ex: The brain has a network of swichtes. 
The quality attributing sentence is used with reference to qualities and properties of 
phenomena. It is a simple subject-predicate-complement structure with a verb 
form of be at predicate and an adjective (or equivalent) at the complement, as in The 
obsession with durability in the arts is not permanent. Negative quality 
attributing sentences are common in argumentation  (Werlich 1976: 218-219). 
SUBJ.*?be_main.*?PCOMPL-S_A
Ex: Endurance in art forms is essential, claims George. 
The action demanding sentence is used with reference to behavioral responses from the 
addressee. Its basic form is the command, as in Be reasonable for a moment!. Action 
demanding sentences are common in instructional texts (Werlich 1976: 219).   
main_FMAINV_IMP.*?OBJ
Ex: Add a layer of pebbles to prevent the soil being washed away. 
@FAUXV_IMP.*?OBJ
Ex: Do not add fertilizer or manure. 
5 Preliminary Results: Accuracy of Linguistic Facets for 
Web Genre Classification 
As pointed out in the introduction, linguistic facets are linguistically-motivated and 
functionally-interpretable features designed to combine qualitative analysis and 
39
quantitative findings to get a more accurate text analysis together with genre and text 
type identification.  In this section we wish to give a hint about their discriminating 
power.
We selected four web genres -- blogs, FAQs, front pages, and personal home pages -- and 
collected 200 web pages per genres from public specialized web archives. Then we built 
two SVM classifiers with the Weka package (Witten and Frank 2000). One model was 
built using 211 POS trigrams and the other one with 84 linguistic facets.
There are several ways of selecting POS trigrams. The total amount of POS trigrams in a 
corpus can be several thousands. First we computed POS trigrams per each web genre, 
and deleted those POS trigrams with a frequency lesser than 200 (each web genre was 
represented by 200 web pages, so in the most optimistic hypothesis a POS trigram was 
present at least once in each of the web pages). Then we collected all the POS trigrams 
for all the four web genres into a single file, and sorted them into a list ignoring their 
frequencies of occurrence in the single web genres. Finally we deleted all the POS 
trigrams that appeared more than twice in this list. The rationale behind this choice is 
that in order to be discriminating, a POS trigram must not be present in all web genres, 
and we decided a threshold of two out of four web genres. We ended up with 211 POS 
trigrams.
The 84 linguistic facets comprised 27 functional cues, 13 connectives, 29 subordinate 
patterns, 9 simple sentence patterns (we added 3 variants to the patterns presented in 
subsection 4.5), and 6 subordinators not fully disambiguated with syntactic patterns (if, 
as, while, whereas, when, and since)
Linguistic facets are mainly based on syntactic annotation, and POS trigrams represent 
a shallow approach to syntax. Both of them have a syntactic nature so they can be 
compared consistently. We ran the classifiers ten times with ten different seeds and 
averaged the accuracy results. 211 POS trigrams returned an averaged accuracy of 
86.50%, while linguistic facets returned an averaged accuracy of 84.28%. According to 
these figures, the performance of linguistic facets is very promising, considering that 
this is only an initial set of 84 features.
