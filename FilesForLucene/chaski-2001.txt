Empirical evaluations of language-based
author identification techniques

ABSTRACT Recent Court decisions in the United States call for the empirical testing
of language-based author identification techniques. This article shows the results of
such testing. The tested hypotheses include: syntactic analysis, syntactically classified
punctuation, sentential complexity, vocabulary richness, readability, content analysis,
spelling errors, punctuation errors, word form errors, and grammatical errors. 
These hypotheses are tested on a set of documents written by four women who are
similar in age, educational level, and dialectal background: two of the women are Euro-
American, and two are Afro-American. Each hypothesis is tested separately to
determine its ability to differentiate documents from different authors and cluster doc-
uments from each author. Hypotheses which quantify linguistic features are tested
statistically using the chi-square statistic. Discrimination error rates are calculated. Only
two hypotheses successfully differentiate and cluster documents: syntactic analysis and
syntactically classified punctuation.

THE TIMELY NEED FOR EMPIRICAL EVALUATIONS 
In the early part of 2000, in the United States District Court, District of
New Jersey, Roy Van Wyk was brought to trial for making threatening
communications (United States v. Van Wyk, 83 F.Supp.2d 515, D.N.J.,
2000). The Government, represented by Assistant US Attorney Charles B.
McKenna, proposed that Special Agent James R. Fitzgerald of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation be allowed to testify as an expert in forensic styl-
istics (later text analysis) about the authorship of the threatening letters.1
The Government argued that Fitzgerald’s testimony should be admitted
because it relied on McMenamin’s peer-reviewed publication (McMe-
namin 1993), thus meeting at least one of the Daubert criteria which
Federal judges must consider when determining the admissibility of evi-
dence. Federal judges consider a variety of guidelines for admitting
scientific and technical evidence; the Daubert criteria focus on the
empirical reliability of a scientific technique.2 Thus, the Government
argued that Fitzgerald’s technique should be admitted based on the fact
that he relied on McMenamin (1993) which demonstrates the empirical
reliability deducible from peer review before publication.

Defendant Van Wyk, represented by Assistant Federal Public Defender
John H. Yauch, filed a motion in limine to exclude the proposed testimony
of Agent Fitzgerald. The Defence argued that the ‘proffered expert tes-
timony is subjective, unreliable and lacks measurable standards’ (Van Wyk,
83 F.Supp.2d 515, 521). Thus, the Defence argued that admitting forensic
stylistics testimony would violate several other criteria of the Daubert
standard of empirical reliability, such as falsifiability of the technique,
known error rate, and standard operating procedures for performing the
technique (see Note 2 for more discussion of admissibility factors). 
The Court did, in fact, recognize the ‘lack of scientific reliability of
forensic stylistics’: 
Although Fitzgerald employed a particular methodology that may be
subject to testing, neither Fitzgerald nor the Government has been able
to identify a known rate of error, establish what amount of samples is
necessary for an expert to be able to reach a conclusion as to probability
of authorship, or pinpoint any meaningful peer review. Additionally, as
Defendant argues, there is no universally recognized standard for certi-
fying an individual as an expert in forensic stylistics. 
(Van Wyk, 83 F.Supp.2d 515, 523)
The Van Wyk case and Judge Bassler’s ruling demonstrate the timely need
for a sound and tested methodology for language-based author identifi-
cation techniques. 
Further, this case reveals that the Courts want the scientist-experts to
self-regulate in terms of developing and testing techniques and in terms of
certifying or qualifying experts. It is the linguists’ responsibility to create
the theoretically sound hypotheses, test these hypotheses and perform the
empirical evaluation of our own methods. It is the linguists’ responsibility
to recognize junk science before it gets to court. These are especially inter-
esting obligations in the case of forensic linguistics, because, as any linguist
knows, everyone has something to say about language, and linguistics has
many sister-disciplines within academia.
In this article, I present the results of experiments testing the empirical
reliability of language-based author identification techniques currently in
use in the United States.3 These techniques can be divided into three
groups. 
In the first group are two techniques – syntactically classified punctu-
ation and syntactic analysis of phrase structure – which withstand the
scrutiny of experimental testing and statistical analysis. These two tech-
niques are rooted in linguistic theory, are underpinned by factual ideas
about linguistic performance, and demonstrate the utility of linguistics in
forensic applications. Further, since these two techniques quantify lin-
guistic patterns, they are amenable to statistical testing and thus allow us
2
Language-based author identification techniques
straightforward ways to decide the authorship question and to calculate
error rates. Finally, these two linguistics-based techniques correctly differ-
entiate different authors and cluster the questioned document with its
actual author with a high level of accuracy.
In the second group are several techniques – sentential complexity,
vocabulary richness, readability, content analysis – which quantify lin-
guistic patterns, and are amenable to statistical testing. Error rates are
easily calculable. These techniques derive from language-related disci-
plines, but unfortunately they rest on ideas about linguistic performance
which do not hold within the forensic context. For instance, the type-
token ratio is a venerable idea with predictable results in the context of
Shakespeare studies, but within the confines of a forensic investigation
with its typically short documents, the type-token ratio loses its utility.
Finally, these techniques fail to differentiate authors and/or cluster docu-
ments correctly with a high level of accuracy. 
In the third group are ‘forensic stylistics’ techniques – spelling errors,
punctuation errors, word form errors, grammatical errors – which are
rooted in handwriting identification and prescriptive grammar. These
techniques do not quantify linguistic patterns; they are not amenable to
statistical testing nor the calculation of error rates. Further, these pre-
scriptive techniques rest upon factually incorrect ideas about individuality
in language performance and violate theoretical principles of modern lin-
guistics. Finally, these techniques fail to differentiate between documents
authored by different writers and/or fail to cluster documents authored
by the same writer with a high level of accuracy. 
There is another approach to language-based author identification
exemplified by literary critics such as Donald Foster. In an interview with
Professor Foster, The New York Times (November 19, 1997 Metro
Section) published a section of Professor Foster’s analysis of the JonBenet
Ramsey ransom note. From the first two words of the note (‘Listen care-
fully!’), Professor Foster deduced, ‘diction associated with films like
“Ransom,” “Dirty Harry,” and “Speed.” ... diction associated with a chief
executive officer, day-to-day business concerns or computer equipment,
possibly indicated a businessperson as author, and/or someone wishing to
implicate John Ramsey.’ Foster’s method apparently relies completely on
the literary critic’s subjective word associations. It is impossible to
replicate the method, since one person’s subjective word association is
naturally different from another’s subjective word association. I, for one,
do not associate the phrase ‘listen carefully!’ to action movies or hi-tech
business operations. Because this approach is purely speculative and relies
completely on the literary critic’s subjective response to the words, it is
impossible to test scientifically and, therefore, it will not be considered
any further in this article.

Forensic Linguistics
Experimental method and task
Ten falsifiable hypotheses about language-based author identification were
tested separately on one set of documents written by four subjects matched
as well as possible for sociolinguistic features. Each hypothesis was tested
to determine if (a) it could accurately differentiate documents written by
the four different subjects and (b) if it could correctly assign an unknown
document to one of the four subjects. The documents were drawn from
the author’s Writing Sample Database. A full description of the Writing
Sample Database, demographic features of the writers and topics of the
writing samples can be found in Appendix 1.
These experiments were intended to simulate as much as possible the
actual task of a forensic examination. The analyst was given a set of known
documents and a questioned document. These documents were unedited,
actual writings; they contain different numbers of words, and they are
rather short. These experiments are intended to test the lower limits of
text length and quantity because forensically significant documents are
often short and cannot be amplified; indeed, even known documents are
often short in length and limited in quantity. The experiments use data
reflecting the lower limits so that the results apply to actual casework. If
the tested technique can work on the lower limits, it can certainly work on
cases with abundant words in abundant documents. On the other hand, if
the tested technique cannot work accurately on the lower limits, the tech-
nique’s supporters must demonstrate that the technique can work when
the limits are raised to include longer documents or more documents and
accept that the technique cannot work under the typical, lower restraints
of actual cases. 
The subjects, or in casework the suspects, are matched as well as pos-
sible on sociolinguistically relevant features such as age, sex, race, dialect
and educational level. In much casework, the suspects will share at least
some if not all of these features. Again, the experiments use data reflecting
the most restrictive type of case so that the techniques can be tested as rig-
orously as possible. Since dialectal features are relatively well-documented
and easy to spot, the more difficult case is differentiating among docu-
ments from the same dialect. If the tested technique can differentiate the
authors of documents which share dialectal features, then it can certainly
work on documents which do not share dialectal features. On the other
hand, if the tested technique can only work when the documents arise
from different dialects, the technique probably only distinguishes dialectal
characteristics and not idiolectal characteristics.
The text-types are also controlled in the experiments much as they
would be controlled in actual casework. Variations in communicative func-
tions cause easily recognizable differences in text-types such as essays,
business letters, and love letters. Again, since these register differences are
relatively well-documented and easy to spot, the more difficult case is 
4
Language-based author identification techniques
differentiating among documents from the same register. If the tested tech-
nique can differentiate the authors of documents from the same register,
then it can certainly work on documents from different registers. On the
other hand, if the tested technique can only differentiate different docu-
ments arising from different registers, the technique probably only
distinguishes register characteristics and not idiolectal characteristics of
the authors. 
There is one important way in which the experiments do not simulate
actual casework. In actual case work, the forensic linguist may want to use
the three possible conclusions which are standard to many forensic sci-
ences: (1) the known and questioned items belong to the same person
(identification/inclusion); (2) the known and questioned items belong to
different persons (elimination/exclusion); and (3) the analyst is unable to
state a conclusion about authorship based on the current set of known
items (inconclusive evidence/no conclusion). These experiments, however,
allow for only two possible conclusions. In these experiments, the tested
hypothesis either (a) accurately shows that documents are written by dif-
ferent authors; (b) accurately shows that the questioned document is
written by the one, correct author. These experiments do not allow for the
third conclusion that the tested hypothesis is unable to determine the
authorship on the basis of the texts, because we are testing each hypothesis
against the same set of texts. The purpose of these experiments is to test
the hypotheses’ discrimination and clustering ability against one set of
data, not to test the kind of data needed for each hypothesis. But interest-
ingly, the type of data needed for each hypothesis, especially the length of
texts, comes to light when we consider the accuracy of each hypothesis’
discrimination and grouping ability. 
Test subjects
The tests were conducted on a set of documents authored by four women
in their forties, two Euro-American, two Afro-American, with two-to-
three years of college education and long-term exposure to the Delmarva
dialect of the Eastern United States. These women, identified only by the
database identifier, were subjects 001, 009, 016, and 080. 
In order to demonstrate the validity or invalidity of certain hypotheses
about individuality of language use in writing, it was sometimes useful to
include additional subjects. These subjects are always referred to by their
database identifier. Pertinent sociolinguistic features of any additional sub-
jects are given at the time each test result is reported; the full
sociolinguistic and demographic features of the Writing Sample Database
can be found in Appendix 1.
Writing sample data
Documents written by the test subjects were coded by the author’s
5
Forensic Linguistics
database identifier and task identification (e.g. 001-01). One unidentified
document was labelled SQD2. Document SQD2 was selected from the
writing samples of one of the four test subjects and typed by a research
intern so that the analyst would have no experience with it prior to the
experimental analyses. The actual documents are reproduced in Appendix
2.
Table 1 shows the number of words in the documents from the four
women test subjects.
Table 1 Number of words in documents from four women writers
Experimental task
The experimental objective is to discover if any language-based author
identification technique correctly discriminates between documents
written by different authors and correctly clusters SQD2 with documents
written by the actual author. All of the techniques have been re-created as
accurately as possible from their original sources in questioned document
examination, literary criticism, textual criticism, communications and lin-
guistics. The analyst applied one language-based author identification
technique at a time to all the documents in the set. Based on the technique,
the analyst assigned the documents to authorship sets.
If the techniques measure and quantify the data, these measurements
are tested statistically to determine the probability that the differing mea-
sures for each document set either come from or do not come from the
same source.
Interpretation of results
After the application of the techniques, the research intern revealed to the
analyst that document SQD2 was actually authored by subject 016. This
fact allowed us to interpret the test results in terms of the replicability of
the techniques. All of the techniques have been previously used by sources
in questioned document examination, literary criticism, textual criticism,
communications and linguistics. Therefore, if a technique produced the
correct assignment of documents to authors in this experimental task, it is

a replicable technique, but if it produced incorrect assignments, then it is a
non-replicable, unreliable technique.
Error rates
In this experimental task, the discrimination accuracy of the technique is
calculated as a percentage of the times that the technique correctly differ-
entiates documents from different authors and correctly assigns the
questioned document to the correct author. Conversely, the discrimination
error rate is the percentage of times that the technique fails to differentiate
documents from different authors and incorrectly assigns the questioned
document to an incorrect author. In most tests, four women writers are
used. Each writer is paired with each other writer and the questioned doc-
ument to test for similarity or difference: this results in ten pairings. If the
technique performs absolutely perfectly, each writer will be differentiated
from each other writer (six pairings), non-authors will be differentiated
from the questioned document (three pairings) and the questioned doc-
ument will only be clustered with its actual author (one pairing). So a
technique would have a zero error rate if it correctly differentiated nine
pairings and correctly clustered one pairing. Since we will only see this
occur once, it is worth considering the alternative. If a technique fails to
differentiate three of the nine pairings, then it has a discrimination
accuracy of 6 out of 9 or 67 per cent, and a discrimination error rate of 3
out of 9 or 33 per cent. If the technique fails to cluster the questioned doc-
ument with subject 016, it simply fails (with no number attached).
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS: STATISTICALLY TESTABLE
TECHNIQUES WITH GOOD REPLICATION RESULTS
In my empirical testing of language-based author identification techniques,
two techniques look very promising. These are syntactic phrase structures
and syntactically classified punctuation patterns. Both of these techniques
require expertise in modern linguistic analysis. While punctuation patterns
may seem to be an obvious kind of textual phenomenon which both the
American high-school graduate and the language expert would pay
attention to, the way that punctuation patterns are used in the empirical
tests that follow requires knowledge of syntactic structures and statistics.
So while any juror or judge may notice that one document contains lots of
hyphens while another does not, they may not notice that the hyphens in
the one document are always syntactically conditioned in ways that are not
available in the other document. In other words, even such an obvious
feature as punctuation has to be handled in a non-obvious way in order to
yield reliable results for author identification. Syntactic structures, on the
other hand, are the kind of phenomenon which is not obvious to the
American high-school graduate or the language expert who has not been
trained in syntactic theory and analysis.

Syntactic analysis of phrase structure 
The fundamental idea about language individuality underlying this tech-
nique is that syntactic processing is automatized, unconscious behaviour
and therefore is difficult either to disguise or imitate (for more discussion
see Chaski 1998a).
Hypothesis: Abstract syntactic structures differentiate and identify
authors.
Sources: Chaski (1997a, 1997b, 1998b). 
Methodology: Parse text using a generalized phrase structure
grammar.
Count structures and calculate ratios between struc-
tures of related type.
Test for differences between texts statistically. 
Tools: Knowledge of phrase structure grammars.
ALIAS® computer program (not necessary, but
helpful).4
Knowledge and use of X2 statistic.
Since the analyst (with or without the help of ALIAS®) parses each word
of a document, and each phrase of a document, many syntactic features
are available for analysis. For brevity’s sake I will show only one set of
parse results: auxiliary verbal patterns.5 These verbal features include
modal, progressive, passive, perfective, negative inversion, infinitive, verb-
particles, and the elliptical verb; (the causative does not occur in the test
data). All of these features modify the main verb and so are subsumed
under the grammatical heading auxiliary (Aux). The results are presented
in Table 2.

Language-based author identification techniques
The statistical analysis Chaski (2000; 1998; 1997) employed is a
standard technique for categorical frequency data, the chi-square test (for
description, see Seigel and Castellan 1988; Woods, Fletcher and Hughes
1986; Williams 1968). This statistical technique has been independently
reviewed and used in authorship attribution cases by Svartik (1968),
Dreher and Young (1969) and Smith (1994). The chi-square technique has
also been used by O’Brien and Darnell (1982), two economists who
studied the authorship of economics texts. 
The chi-square tests the independence of two groups of categorical fre-
quencies for which we cannot assume or do not want to imply a normal
distribution. While the chi-square statistic is not the most high-powered
statistic, it suits our purposes because we are measuring categorical fre-
quencies for which we are unsure of distributional properties and which
we hope to match or not match to other sets of categorical frequencies.
Two points about applying and interpreting the chi-square results are in
order. First, in applying the chi-square statistic we have to consider the size
of our observed frequencies because these are used to calculate the
expected frequencies. The practical rule allows no more than 20 per cent
of the expected frequencies generated during the calculation to be less
than 5, while none of the expected frequencies can be less than 1 (Seigel
and Castellan 1988; Woods, Fletcher and Hughes 1986; Williams 1968).
As small as some of the observed frequencies in Table 2 are, all of the test
results pass this practical rule. 
Second, the interpretation of the probability is a bit more interesting
than the standard ‘significant difference if below .05’ interpretation of sta-
tistical results because we are asking two questions. We are asking the
result to tell us if the different authors are distinguished and also if the
unknown document is clustered with the correct author. It is possible to
interpret the probabilities to answer both questions (as is also done in
Dreher and Young (1969)). Since the chi-square is testing for difference
between groups, the null hypothesis states that there is no difference
between the groups. We accept this null hypothesis of sameness if the
probability associated with the chi-square result is greater than .05. We
reject the null hypothesis, accepting instead the alternative hypothesis of
difference, if the probability is less than or equal to .05. So, in standard
parlance, there is a statistically significant difference between two groups
of authors/documents, if the probability falls equal to or less than .05,
while there is no difference if the probability rises above .05.
Now let us apply that to our case results, as shown in Table 3. When
two different writers are paired for testing, we want the probability of
their sameness to be very small, to be less than .05, since they are actually
different. When the questioned document and its non-authors are paired
for testing, again we want the probability of their sameness to be very
small, less than .05, since the unknown document was not written by these
9
Forensic Linguistics
authors. But when the questioned document is paired with its actual
author, we want the probability of their sameness to be large, at least
greater than .05. A low p-value demonstrates significant difference, while
a high p-value indicates similarity or at least consistency.
Table 3 shows the results of running the chi-square statistic on the fre-
quencies in Table 2. The probabilities that the writers 001, 009, 016 and
080 show no difference are all low, less than or equal to 5 per cent. Even
the pairing of 001 and 016 meets this test because it could not be rounded
up over the .05 bar. From these low p-values, we conclude that the authors
are different. The syntactic feature technique differentiates different
authors. 
The probabilities that the writers 001, 009, 080 show no difference
from the questioned document are, again, all very low, less than 5 per cent.
From these low p-values, we conclude that these authors are different
from the questioned document. The syntactic feature technique differen-
tiates the questioned document from its non-authors.
But the probability that 016 and the QD are not significantly different –
are similar – is very high, greater than 5 per cent. From this high p-value,
we conclude that 016 and the QD are consistent with each other. The syn-
tactic features technique accurately clusters the questioned document with
the correct author.

Table 3 shows that verbal features correctly differentiate all the writers
from each other, correctly differentiate the questioned document from the
non-authors, and correctly cluster the questioned document with its actual
author. The syntactic phrase structure analysis technique is based in lin-
guistic science, empirically tested on a forensically similar task and
successful in both differentiating and clustering documents.

Language-based author identification techniques
Comments on error rate, sample amount
In this experimental test, syntactic analysis of phrase structure shows a
‘zero’ error rate on very small, forensically similar documents from writers
who are dialectally and demographically similar. While this is a very
promising and even exciting result, it is by no means enough evidence to
proclaim that the technique actually has a ‘zero’ error rate. Forensic tech-
niques which claim to have zero error rates, such as current American
handwriting identification, are able to make such claims because they have
never been empirically and objectively tested; such claims should make
any scientist shudder in disbelief. So instead of interpreting the reported
result in such an incredible, naïve way, it is prudent to recognize that many
more studies which meet the robust standards of short documents by
writers with similar dialectal and demographic features need to be com-
pleted; with continued funding from the US Department of Justice’s
National Institute of Justice, such research is currently being conducted.
A better way to interpret this result is to state that, in the context of this
experiment, the syntactic feature technique shows a 100 per cent correct
matching rate. Since the context of this experiment includes controlling
for dialect and document size, this is a rigorous result.
Punctuation frequency and syntactic function
I will present two hypotheses about punctuation marks which focus on fre-
quency and syntactic function. The fundamental idea about language
individuality in these hypotheses is that punctuation is a graphic (non-
verbal) reflection of syntactic structure. 
Hypothesis: Punctuation mark frequencies discriminate between
authors.
Source: Chaski (1996). 
Methodology: List each punctuation mark.
Test statistically.
Tools: Knowledge of punctuation and syntax; knowledge
and use of X2 statistic.
Punctuation Analysis 1
One way to examine use and non-use of punctuation marks is to count the
frequencies as shown in Table 4. I have added subject 018 to the mix
because she also uses hyphens as does subject 016. Subject 018 is a white,
thirty-one-year-old female with long-term exposure to the Delmarva
dialect who has two years of college education. The results are presented
in Table 4.

Given the standard rule about expected frequencies for the chi-square test,
many of the categories in Table 4 are actually unusable statistically. These
are marked with an asterisk in Table 4. In order to use the chi-square
properly, I have run the statistic using only at most five features for dif-
ferent pairings of authors; (the number of features is one more than the
degrees of freedom).
Analysis
Assuming the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the punc-
tuation patterns of the five women writers in Table 4, what is the chance
that these punctuation patterns come from the same author? What we
would expect to see is that there will be, on the one hand, a really small
chance (of no difference or sameness) when the documents come from dif-
ferent authors, and, on the other hand, a chance greater than 5 per cent
when they come from the same author. Results are shown in Table 5; prob-
lematic results are bolded.
Punctuation mark patterns correctly differentiate between nine of the
ten pairings, but fail to differentiate between one pair of writers
(009/080). Note that the technique distinguishes successfully between
writers 016 and 018 even though these two writers superficially look alike
because of their hyphens. Further, punctuation mark patterns correctly
differentiate the questioned document from the four non-authors, but fail
to cluster the questioned document with its actual author (016/QD2). So
in terms of discriminating between writers, the technique accurately 
12
Language-based author identification techniques
discriminates thirteen out of fourteen times or is 92.8 per cent successful,
with an error rate of 7.1 per cent for discrimination. But in terms of clus-
tering a document with its actual author, the technique fails. Even so, a
technique that holds such promise as 93 per cent discrimination accuracy
should be further studied. 
Punctuation reflects syntactic structure, thus serving as an alternate
means of getting at syntactic structure (see Nunberg 1988, Meyer 1987).
Perhaps if we syntactically classify the punctuation marks, we will be able
to retain a high level of accuracy in discriminating between authors and
also successfully cluster a document with its author.
Hypothesis: Syntactically classified punctuation discriminates
between authors.
Source: Chaski (1996).
Methodology: List each punctuation mark.
Classify by the mark’s syntactic function.
Test statistically.
Tools: Knowledge of punctuation and syntax; knowledge and
use of X2 statistic.
Syntactically classified punctuation results are shown in Table 6.

Again, given the standard rule about expected frequencies for the chi-
square test, most categories in Table 6 are actually unusable statistically,
due to low frequencies. A standard solution for this problem is to consol-
14

idate categories, thereby enlarging frequencies (Siegel and Castellan 1988;
Woods, Fletcher and Hughes 1986). The finely tuned categories in Table 6
can be logically collapsed into: sentential boundary, clausal boundary,
phrasal boundary, appositive or embedding boundary, and word-internal
marks, as shown in Table 7. Probabilities are shown in Table 8, with
incorrect results bolded.

Syntactically classified punctuation patterns correctly differentiate the
questioned document from its non-authors and separate eight pairings of
the five writers (for a discrimination accuracy of twelve out of fourteen or
85.7 per cent ) but fail to differentiate between two pairings which both
include subject 080 (009/080 and 001/080) for an error rate of 14.2 per
15
Forensic Linguistics
cent. Importantly, syntactically classified punctuation patterns correctly
cluster the questioned document with its actual author. So, in handling
punctuation through syntactic classification (rather than frequency), the
discrimination accuracy has decreased from 93 per cent to 86 per cent
while the clustering accuracy has changed from wrong to right.
The failure to differentiate between two pairings may not be a matter of
the technique, however, as much as of the data. A very important aspect of
this experimental result is that it shows us the kind of data that is required
to perform this specific technique. When we look at the problematic
results in light of the number of words in the documents, as shown in
Table 9, (009/080, and 001/080), it is obvious that subject 080 has the
smallest amount of text in the test samples.

018 986 810 1796
080 239 93 103 345
SQD2 341 
When we pair the 345-word sample of 080 with the 531-word sample of
subject 001, there is not enough categorical data to differentiate the two.
In fact, in order to maintain the bar of expected frequencies at 20 per cent
less than 5, only two categories (sentence boundary and clausal boundary)
could be used in the statistical calculation. 
But it cannot be merely a matter of how many words are in the docu-
ments, because the technique differentiates SQD2, with almost the same
number of words as subject 080, from subject 001. Sample size definitely
provides a limit for this technique, but the similarity of the syntactically
classified punctuation patterns in two authors also matters. Both subjects
009 and 016 have 900-word samples, and the technique is able to differ-
entiate 080 from 016, but not from 009. Subjects 009 and 080 share very
low use of appositive punctuation and word-internal punctuation, so that,
in order to maintain the bar of expected frequencies at 20 per cent less
than 5, only three categories (sentence, clausal and phrasal boundary)
were used in the statistical calculation. On the other hand, subject 016
differs from both 009 and 080 in having a relatively high use of appositive
punctuation. Only three categories were useable in comparing 016 and
16
Language-based author identification techniques
080, while four categories were usable in comparing 016 and 009. In
general, gathering more data is always the first way to handle these kinds
of problem with both sample size and pairwise similarity, but in forensic
situations, gathering more data may be impossible. 
It is safe to conclude that, at least in this forensically similar experi-
mental task, quantified punctuation techniques are promising, if not
totally successful. The simple punctuation-frequency technique is able to
differentiate between different writers most, 92.8 per cent, of the time, but
fails to cluster the questioned document with the actual writer. The syn-
tactically classified punctuation technique is able to differentiate between
different writers most, 86 per cent, of the time and it also can cluster the
documents of one writer. 
But, in my opinion, neither measures of punctuation frequency nor
measures of syntactically classified punctuation should be used alone in an
actual forensic examination, because there is an error-rate (perhaps as high
as 14 per cent ) associated with these techniques, especially when the
sample sizes are less than 250 words. 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS: STATISTICALLY TESTABLE
TECHNIQUES WITH POOR REPLICATION RESULTS
Sentential complexity
Svartvik’s (1968) hypothesis that sentential complexity identifies authors
exemplifies the kind of precise grounding in linguistics and statistical
analysis which is essential for any method in forensic linguistics. Indeed,
Svartvik’s work serves as the model which all forensic linguists should
emulate. This said, the sentential complexity technique showed very high
error rates when it was tested on the writing samples used in these repli-
cation experiments.
Hypothesis: Sentential complexity identifies authors.
The underlying idea about language individuality in
sentential complexity analysis is that some sentence
structures are more complex than others and that
people will differ in their ability to produce different
types of sentential complexity.
Source: Svartvik (1968).
Methodology: Classify sentences into sentential categories.
Count frequencies of each category.
Test statistically. 
Tools: Knowledge of sentential syntactic categories such as
simple, compound, complex, and compound-complex
or Svartvik’s own six clausal categories; knowledge
and use of X2 statistic.

The results are shown in Table 10.

Analysis
The hypothesis that patterns of sentential complexity differentiates
between writers can be tested statistically, and in fact Svartvik (1968) also
used the chi-square test. Assuming the null hypothesis that there is no dif-
ference between the sentential complexity patterns, what is the chance
that these patterns come from the same author? The results are shown in
Table 11; incorrect results are bolded. As in earlier statistical tables, we use
our standard interpretation of the probabilities as ‘low indicating dif-
ference, high indicating similarity’ and apply this to the actual
similarity/difference of authors in the document set. So bolded results
mean that the probability suggests the incorrect similarity or difference
that is in the actual document set.

These probabilities suggest that writer 016 can be clearly differentiated
from the three other writers by the sentential complexity method, because
the chance of there being no difference between them is so extremely low
(8 in 10,000; 1 in 10,000; 3 in 10,000). Writer 009 is differentiated from
001 and 016, but not from 080. Writer 080 can only be differentiated
from 016, but cannot be distinguished from 001 and 009. Writer 001 is
18
Language-based author identification techniques
differentiated from 009 and 016, but not from 080. Further, the technique
differentiates QD2 from only one of the non-authors (009), while it is
unable to discriminate the questioned document from the other two non-
authors (001 and 080). In terms of discrimination accuracy this technique
is correct five out of nine times or 56 per cent ; this is a 44 per cent error
rate. Finally, the sentential complexity technique fails to cluster SQD2
with its actual author, subject 016.
Svartvik’s measure of sentential complexity separated relative clauses
from other types of subordinate clauses and counted compound verb
phrases as separate clauses. This categorization of clausal structure may
not be completely defensible within current generative grammar, but it
highlights the fact that different categorization and grammatical frame-
works may lead to different results. Perhaps the replicability of this
technique relies specifically on how we categorize sentential complexity, in
which case these disappointing experimental results demonstrate that the
technique warrants refinement and standardization rather than rejection. 
Replication results
The hypothesis that sentential complexity patterns identify authors has
failed to be replicated successfully in a forensically similar test; however,
this failure to be replicated may be caused by methodological problems in
determining how to categorize and count sentential complexity.
Vocabulary measures
Hypothesis: Vocabulary richness identifies authors.
Sources: See Holmes (1994) for review and references; Baker
(1988) for PACE; Foster (1989).
Methodology: Count number of total words in text; let N = tokens. 
Count number of distinct words in text; let V = types.
Calculate TTR and PACE for texts of each writer.
Compare each writer’s TTR and PACE to each other’s. 
Tools: Type-Token Ratio and Pace. 
TTR = V/N
PACE = 1/TTR
The results are shown in Table 12.

The TTR technique is able to correctly differentiate only five of nine
pairings for a discrimination accuracy of only 56 per cent ; this is an error
rate of 44 per cent. Finally, the TTR technique is unable to correctly assign
016 as the author of the questioned document.
Not surprisingly, PACE (which is the reciprocal of TTR) leads to the
same errors.
Replication results
The hypothesis that vocabulary richness identifies authors has failed to be
replicated successfully in a forensically similar test. 
Hypothesis: Hapax Legomena identify authors.

The HLR technique is able to differentiate seven of nine pairings of dif-
ferent authors, for a discrimination accuracy of 78 per cent, with an error
rate of 22 per cent. Further, the HLR technique fails to correctly cluster
the questioned document with its actual author, 016.
Replication results
The hypothesis that Hapax Legomena identify authors has failed to be
replicated successfully in a forensically similar test.
Readability measures
Readability measures typically rely on sentence length and word length.
Hypothesis: Readability measures identify authors.

hypothesis; see Holmes (1994) for review and refer-
ences; Foster (1989).
Methodology: Select readability formula.
Apply readability formula manually or by computer
(e.g. through word processing programs).
Compare grade level, etc. for each text to other texts.
Tools: Readability formulae, possibly t-test or correlation sta-
tistics.

Language-based author identification techniques
Analysis
Table 16 shows the scores of different readability tests for each document
within each author’s set. There is variation among the documents in each
author’s set; for instance, in 001’s three documents, the Gunning-Fog
scores are 10.6, 14.3 and 9.1, respectively. 
Ellis and Dick (1996), in their work on Civil War correspondents,
compare the readability scores of different writers by the t-test. Using the
null hypothesis that there is no difference between the readability scores of
different writers, we would expect to see very low probabilities with pairs
of different authors and a very high probability with the pairing of the
questioned document with its actual author 016. The results of running a
paired t-test with one-tail probability on the data in Table 16 (except the
passive sentence data, since it is not an actual test score but a simple fre-
quency) is shown in Table 17. 
Table 17 Paired t-test with one-tail probability results for readability mea-

The probabilities show that only one pair of writers (009/016) can be dif-
ferentiated from each other because their chance of similarity is so low (1
in 10,000). The three other writers cannot be differentiated from each
other; that is, the p-values for these pairings are all far above 5 per cent.
Further, the questioned document is not differentiated from its non-
authors; again, the probabilities for these pairings are all far above 5 per
cent. The readability technique is able to differentiate only one of nine
pairings of different authors, for a discrimination accuracy of 11 per cent,
with an error rate of 89 per cent. But the readability technique does
manage to cluster the questioned document with its actual author.
Replication results
The hypothesis that readability measures identify authors has failed to be
replicated successfully in a forensically similar test.

Semantic similarities
Hypothesis: Content Analysis identifies/discriminates between
authors.
Source: Kenneth Litkowski (communication on CORPORA
electronic list)
Methodology: Classify each word in document by semantic category.
Analyse statistically the distance between documents.
Tools: Classification scheme based on semantic categories;
linear discriminant functions for statistically com-
puting distance between documents.
This hypothesis first came to my attention in a discussion on the electronic
list CORPORA in which Kenneth Litkowski said that he had heard of
content analysis as a means of determining authorship. I contacted Mr
Litkowski and the experimental data was exchanged. Since Mr Litkowski
had previously collaborated with Professor Donald McTavish on Content
Analysis, Professor McTavish ran the analysis of the test documents and
returned an initial report which was forwarded to me by Mr Litkowski.
Portions of this report are quoted below. McTavish’s alphabetic identifi-
cation of the texts is correlated to the Writing Sample Database identifiers
in Table 18.

Language-based author identification techniques
Analysis
McTavish’s analysis derives both Context-Scores (C-scores) and Emphasis-
Scores (E-Scores). McTavish comments on the C-scores that ‘four texts
(C,F,K,L [001-03, 009-03, 080-02, 080-03]) talk about goals, four talk
about terror (A,D,I,G [001-01, 009-01, 016-03, 016-01]), four talk about
influential people (B,E,H,J [001-02, 009-02, 016-02, 080-01]) and one
(M [QD2]) deals with anger’. The C-Scores clearly identify the semantic
similarities in documents from different authors writing on similar topics,
but it does not cluster documents on different topics by each author.
The Content Analysis technique relies on the idea that there is semantic
similarity in one person’s writing even when the person shifts from one
topic to another. The following results show that this idea is at least par-
tially true. McTavish notes that there are two distinct ‘arcs’ in the results.
In one arc of texts (B-M-A-E), documents 001-02, QD2, 001-01 and 009-
02 are clustered. Two documents from writer 001 are clustered, even
though they are ostensibly about different topics. But this first arc also rep-
resents a similarity among documents from writers 001 and 009. Further,
the first arc clusters QD2 with both 001 and 009. Therefore, whatever
semantic similarity enables the Content Analysis to link the documents
from writer 001 is not strong enough to distinguish 001’s documents from
009 and QD2. 
In the other arc (L-G-D-H-J) documents 080-03, 016-01, 009-01, 016-
02, and 080-01 are clustered. The second arc represents a similarity
between documents from writers 080, 016 and 009. Again, the C-scores
can cluster some documents from authors 080 and 016, but the technique
is unable to distinguish these different authors from each other and from
009.
The first arc is a conglomeration of 001/009/QD2; the second arc con-
tains 009/016/080. These arcs differentiate the pairings 001/016 and
001/080 but they fail to differentiate the pairings 001/009, 009/016,
009/080, and 016/080. Further, the first arc shows the C-scores fail to dif-
ferentiate pairings 001/QD, 009/QD although the C-scores do
discriminate the questioned document from 080. The C-scores technique
is able to differentiate only three of nine pairings of different authors, for
a discrimination accuracy of 33 per cent, with an error rate of 67 per cent.
Further, the C-scores technique does not cluster the questioned document
with its actual author.
The E-Scores appear to cluster texts from all of the writers ‘contex-
tually’ and two of the writers, 080 and QD2, ‘conceptually’. McTavish
comments on the E-scores that:
There is some patterning but it doesn’t seem to connect well with dis-
criminating authorship … I can suggest that some texts are more
different than [sic] the others (F [009-03], K [080-02], C [001-03], and
25
Forensic Linguistics
perhaps I [016-03], contextually; K [080-02], J [080-01] and M [QD2]
conceptually). K seems to be the one that is different in both respects. 
Again, none of the documents from different authors are differentiated.
Further, the E-scores incorrectly link the questioned document with 080. 
Based on these results, the Content Analysis technique has a discrimi-
nation accuracy of between 33 per cent and 0 per cent, for an error rate
ranging from 67 to 100 per cent. The Content Analysis technique simply
fails to cluster the questioned document with its actual author. McTavish
himself recognizes that the semantic categorization of texts is not able to
discriminate between authors, when he comments that ‘there is some pat-
terning but it doesn’t seem to connect well with discriminating
authorship’.
Replication results
The hypothesis that Content Analysis scores identify authors has failed to
be replicated successfully in a forensically similar test. In forensic cases, as
in this experiment, the documents share the same text-type (in this case,
the narrative essay), but the documents rarely, if ever, share the same
topics. It is essential to recognize that the central idea of Content Analysis
for author identification purposes must be the idea that the semantic idi-
olect of a particular author obtains over all sorts of topically different
documents. These experimental results have shown that to be true in part,
because at least one author’s topically different documents were able to be
clustered. But these results have also shown that semantic idiolect is, first,
not able to cluster all documents of each author; second, not able to dif-
ferentiate documents of different authors; and third, not able to identify
the questioned document with the actual author. 
EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS: STATISTICALLY UNTESTABLE
TECHNIQUES WITH POOR REPLICATION RESULTS
The techniques evaluated in this section – spelling errors, punctuation
errors, word form errors, grammatical errors – derive from handwriting
identification and prescriptive grammar. In McMenamin (1993), the tech-
niques are described without any quantification or statistical testing. In
evaluating these techniques empirically, I have attempted to quantify the
results of applying these techniques as much as possible; I have also
attempted to calculate error rates.
Spelling errors
The fundamental idea underlying this technique is that spelling errors are
unique to individuals and constant in an individual’s performance. Fol-
lowing are three analyses of spelling errors that contradict this idea.

Language-based author identification techniques
Hypothesis: Spelling errors identify authors.
Source: McMenamin 1993. 
Methodology: List each spelling error in texts of each writer.
Compare spelling patterns.
Tools: Spellcheckers or other dictionaries; knowledge of
English spelling patterns.
The results are shown in Table 19.

Spelling analysis 1
Given these lists, 001 and 016 appear to be ‘poor spellers’ while 080
appears to be a ‘good speller’ and 009 is probably a ‘good speller’ who suf-
fered a momentary slip of the pen. 001 texts and 016 texts share one
spelling pattern: the [e] before the suffix [ment] in 001’s developement
and 016’s arguement. 001’s uniquness also involves [e] with a suffix but
this pattern cannot be related to other patterns outside the 001 set. 001
texts and SQD2 text share a mislinearization of the graphemes [c, i, e] in
001’s recieve and SQD2’s espeically. 016 texts and SQD2 text show no
relation in spelling patterns. Other spelling errors such as 001’s system-
aticly for systematically or mos for months or 016’s structoring for
structuring and nite for night cannot be related to other patterns in these
documents. 009’s spelling pattern cannot be related to other documents.
If an analyst relied on spelling error, he might mistakenly conclude that
he was dealing with three known writers – the cluster of 001/016, 009 and
080 – rather than four known writers. But even if the four writers were
known to be four different writers through external evidence, the analyst
would conclude erroneously that the questioned document was authored
by 001, rather than the correct conclusion that it was written by subject
016. Only 001 has a spelling error in her writing which is at all similar to
the spelling error in QD2, actually authored by 016.
27

error technique.

The spelling errors technique fails to differentiate 001 from 016 and from
QD2. Even if we generously and dubiously allow the spelling errors tech-
nique the ability to differentiate the other documents on the basis that
nothing about their spelling patterns can relate them to each other, the dis-
crimination accuracy for the technique is 78 per cent with an error rate of
22 per cent. The spelling errors technique simply fails to cluster 016 with
the questioned document.
Replication results
Based on this empirical test, the forensic stylistic technique of spelling
errors has not been replicated. 
Spelling errors test 2
Perhaps the spelling error technique requires more writers in the
suspect set. In order to allow for this, another spelling errors test was
conducted. This time the texts written by the first twenty women in the
Writer Sample Database were extracted and each spelling error was
listed, as shown in Table 21. The first twenty women range in age from
eighteen to forty-nine, so there is less sociolinguistic control in this
test.

Spelling analysis 2
Writers 002 and 011 share several, very similar spelling error patterns.
These are: 
1. errors with doubled consonants:
002 terifying [terrifying]
011 occuring [occurring]
opressed [oppressed]
impresionable [impressionable]
2. errors with doubled consonant with suffix [ly]
002 realy [real + ly > really]
011 politicaly [political + ly> politically]
racialy [racial + ly > racially]
3. errors with vowels preceding nasal consonant
002 behide [behind]
frount [front]
011 aroud [around]
beyound [beyond]
The nasal consonant is dropped in 002’s behide for [behind] and 
011’s aroud for [around]. The vowel preceding the nasal con-
sonant is expanded in 002’s frount for [front], and 011’s 
beyound for [beyond].
4. errors with vowel [I] as in ‘sit’ [sIt]
002 regestration [registration]
011 disfunctional [dysfunctional]
travisty [travesty]
These spelling patterns are very similar, but they originate from two dif-
ferent authors. If an analyst relied on spelling errors, he would mistakenly
conclude that he was were dealing with one known writer – the cluster of
002/011 – rather than two known writers. Likewise, if the common con-
ception of ‘poor spelling’ is used, writers 002, 006, 011, 013, and 018
would be erroneously thought to be one writer, because these five writers
are indeed ‘poor spellers’. But these poor spellers are five distinct authors.
Similarly, the common conception of ‘good spelling’ would erroneously lead
an analyst to conclude that 008 and 010 are one and the same writer because
they are both in fact good spellers, but two good spellers, not one. So the
spelling errors technique only distinguishes thirteen of the twenty writers,
for a discrimination accuracy of 65 per cent and an error rate of 35 per cent.
The frequency of spelling errors is another issue which should be con-
sidered, as Goutsos (1995) pointed out with regard to McMenamin’s (1993)
30
Language-based author identification techniques
spelling-based analysis. Even errors that appear to me, subjectively, as rare,
such as the behide/aroud pattern, are, objectively, not so odd that they
cannot be shared, as shown by writers 002 and 011. Different writers can
and do produce the same spelling errors.
Replication results
Again, based on this second empirical test, the forensic stylistic technique
of spelling errors has not been replicated.
Spelling analysis 3
A subtle assumption of the spelling error technique is that an incorrect
spelling is constant throughout a person’s spelling. If it weren’t constant, it
could certainly not function as ‘idiosyncratic’ or indicative of authorship.
But actually correct and incorrect spellings of the same word do occur in
one writer’s documents. Consider the data in Table 22, again drawn from
the Writing Sample Database. 
Table 22 Correct and incorrect spelling of same words in subject 013 texts
Word Subject 013 errors Subject 013 correct forms
a [at]: I went to work a Mountaire at this present time in my life
a [and]: bigger a biter things add to that and say
biter [better]: bigger a biter things much better
hope for a biter future
motorivates: daughter motorivates me I’m determined, motivated, and
These patterns show that the same writer who misspells a word sometimes
can correctly spell it other times. Spelling errors are not necessarily con-
stant among several documents written by one author, and even on
different lines within one document written by one author, as in the case
of subject 013. If the analyst relied on spelling errors, the analyst might
erroneously conclude that two documents were not really written by one
author or that one document was authored by two writers. 
Replication results
Therefore, an underlying premise for the forensic stylistics technique of
spelling errors has been shown to be inaccurate, within a forensically
similar test.
More on punctuation 
In this section, I shall examine two hypotheses about punctuation as an indi-
vidualizing characteristic of writing. These claims include the use and
non-use of particular marks, and use and non-use of sets of punctuation
marks. The underlying idea here is that punctuation marks are idiosyncratic. 
31
Forensic Linguistics
Hypothesis: Punctuation mark use and non-use identifies authors. 
Sources: McMenamin (1993).
Methodology: List punctuation marks used and not-used in docu-
ments.
The digit 1 signifies use; the digit 0 signifies non-use.
Tools: Knowledge of American English punctuation marks,
word processing or editing search tools. 
The results are shown in Table 23.

Punctuation analysis 1
Table 23 shows the punctuation marks that are used or not used in the
documents of five women writers and the questioned document. The final
column in Table 23 shows how each punctuation mark’s use or non-use by
the writers clusters documents. So, for instance, all the documents from all
32
Language-based author identification techniques
the writers are clustered by the use and non-use patterns of the period,
comma and ellipsis, while the use and non-use patterns of the semi-colon
clusters documents from writers 001/009/016 on the one hand and docu-
ments from writers 080/018/QD2 on the other. It is apparent that the use
or non-use of punctuation marks fails to differentiate most writers from
each other most of the time. Table 24 shows the number of punctuation
use/non-use features that are shared by the pairings of the five writers; all
five writers share at least half of the marks with each other.
Table 24 Differentiation and cluster abilities of punctuation use/non-use

018/QD 10 no
080/QD 12 no Yes?
016/QD 12 Yes?
Based on Table 24 we can calculate the discrimination accuracy of the
punctuation use/non-use technique as 0 per cent, or 100 per cent error
rate, in this experimental task.
When we compare the questioned document patterns to the other pat-
terns, it is apparent that many punctuation marks’ use and non-use are
shared among these five women writers and the questioned document. If
an analyst relied on punctuation use and non-use, they might mistakenly
draw two false conclusions from the patterns in Table 23. Most conserva-
tively, the forensic stylistics analyst might conclude that none, including
the actual author, wrote the questioned document because none has the
same exact pattern of punctuation use and non-use. Alternatively, the
forensic stylistics analyst might conclude that either 016 or 080 authored
QD2, because they both have the fewest differences – only three – from
QD2. Subject 016 and QD2 differ in the semicolon, exclamation point,
33
Forensic Linguistics
and underline. Subject 080 differs from QD2 in the colon, quotation
marks and parentheses. Notice that there is nothing in McMenamin’s
methodology which tells us that one set of three shared features is less
important than another set of three shared features. With either of these
conclusions, the punctuation use/non-use technique fails to cluster the
questioned document exclusively with its actual author, 016.
Replication results
Based on this empirical test, the forensic stylistic technique of punctuation
use and non-use has not been replicated. 
Punctuation analysis 2
Exact patterns of punctuation use and non-use are shared by different
writers. 
The results in Table 23 suggest that punctuation use and non-use pat-
terns may be individual, since every writer’s pattern is indeed different.
The punctuation patterns of forty authors from the Writing Sample
Database, the first twenty women and first twenty men, were examined to
discover whether exact punctuation patterns – not simply marks – can be
shared. Table 25 shows that they can and are.

Language-based author identification techniques
In Set A, there are two possible misidentifications; in Set B, five; and in Set
C, three. In total, ten of the forty authors, or 25 per cent, share their punc-
tuation use and non-use patterns with at least one other person and so
would not be differentiated by this technique. Further, Set A differs from
Set B by only two features (hyphen and plus), and from Set C by only one
feature (plus). Set B differs from Set C by only one feature (hyphen). Let’s
say that we allow for intra-author variation by allowing for differences up
to certain limits, say up to three differences as we said in the earlier
analysis. Then all ten of these writers would fall within these limits and be
misidentified as one author based on their use and non-use of punctuation.
Replication results
The forensic stylistic technique of punctuation use and non-use has not been
replicated, for a second time, in a forensically similar test.
Grammatical errors
The fundamental idea underlying the grammatical errors technique, as far
as I can tell from McMenamin (1993), is that prescriptive errors are indi-
vidual. This idea is essentially flawed: prescriptivism and prescriptive
grammar always deal with the dialectal rather than idiolectal level of lan-
guage use. This is why prescriptive grammarians can list the ‘ten most
frequent errors’ (Berry 1971).
Hypothesis: Grammatical errors identify authors.
Source: McMenamin (1993).
Methodology: List all grammatical errors in text, using school
grammar.
Compare errors. 
Tools: Prescriptive grammar books, grammar checker in word
processing software.
The results are shown in Table 26.

Forensic Linguistics
The prescriptive grammarian or forensic stylistician would not be able
to differentiate 001 from 009, 016 or 080; nor differentiate 009 from 016
or 080; nor differentiate 016 from 080. Further, the prescriptive gram-
marian or forensic stylistician would not be able to differentiate any of the
non-authors from the questioned document. The discrimination accuracy
is nil, while the error rate for differentiating authors is 100 per cent. But
interestingly, the questioned document would, however, be correctly
assigned to 016 on the basis that they share the exact pattern of errors and
non-errors. 
Replication results
The grammatical errors technique has failed replication of differentiating
writers but has succeeded replication of clustering.
Grammatical accidence
A variation of the spelling errors technique is the grammatical accidence or
word form error technique. In this technique the spelling errors are all
related to phonetically similar word forms such as their/there/they’re.
Again, the idea is that these kinds of word form confusion are idiosyn-
cratic, not shared, and constant in a writer’s habit.
Hypothesis: Grammatical accidence (word form) errors identify
authors.
Source: McMenamin 1993. 
Methodology: List each word usage error in texts of each writer.
Compare word usage error patterns.
Tools: Spellcheckers or grammar checkers, word processing
or editing search programs; knowledge of English
vocabulary and contraction rules.
None of the four women writers in our experimental task showed any
word form confusions. In order to test this hypothesis, the following data
are drawn from the first twenty female writers and the first twenty male
writers of the Writing Sample Database. The female writers’ identifiers
range from 001–020; the male identifiers range from 033–058.
The results are shown in Table 27.

Word form analysis 1
The data from forty writers demonstrates that these kinds of form confu-
sions are not unique to individuals because they are shared among
different writers, both males and females, with a wide age range, and four
ethnicities (Afro-American, Euro-American, Hispanic and Native
American Indian). 
Three writers share the your/you’re confusion. One writer from the
Writing Sample Database produces hear for here, (and also uses the form
here correctly sometimes). Four writers use then for than, and two writers
use than for then. Seven writers share the their/there confusion; six writers
use its for it’s. If an analyst assumed that form confusions are indicative of
authorship, he would be unable to differentiate different authors. For
example, he might conclude that 011, 045, 046, 054 are all one author
because they all confuse then for than. The error rates based on inability to
differentiate different authors by shared word form confusions ranges
from a low of 7.5 per cent (when only three of forty writers share the
word confusion and would thus be indistinguishable from each other) to a
high of 27.5 per cent (when eleven of the forty writers share the word
form confusion and would thus be indistinguishable from each other). 
Twenty of the forty writers, or a full half, make at least one type of form
confusion. Of the twenty that make the form confusions listed above, one
makes four types, three writers make three types, and another three make
two types of confusion (and to make things even more confusing, the
forms above are not the only ones that are confusible in English!). Again,
if an analyst assumed that the rate of word usage errors is indicative of
authorship, he would be unable to differentiate different authors. For
example, he might conclude that 046 and 045 are the same author because
they both make two types of form confusion. 
The technique of confusible word forms is not indicative of authorship:
(1) too many people confuse forms, and (2) different writers share the
same rates of confusible forms (one type, two types, three types). 
Replication results
Therefore, the only conclusion we can draw from Analysis 1 is that the
forensic stylistic technique of word usage errors is not replicated as dis-
criminating between authors or clustering documents of authors.
Word form analysis 2
Perhaps Analysis 1 is unfair because what McMenamin means is that the
actual errors (rather than the act of the error) are significant indicators of
authorship. So maybe it doesn’t matter that three of forty writers make
two types of form confusion. Maybe what matters is the actual errors. 
In this light, consider subjects 015, 045 and 013. All three of these
writers share the your/you’re mistake. All three of these writers have
problems with there/their/they’re; 045 and 013 share the same exact error
38
Language-based author identification techniques
and 015 has a related one. Subjects 045 and 013 confuse then and than
(but in opposite ways). If an analyst assumed that the occurrence of similar
word usage errors in different documents is indicative of authorship, he
would erroneously conclude subjects 015, 045 and 013 are the same
person or, at best, that 045 and 013 are the same person. 
Replication results
Therefore, again the only conclusion we can draw from Analysis 2 is that
the forensic stylistic technique of word usage errors is not replicated as dis-
criminating between authors.
Word form analysis 3
The data from the Writing Sample Database also allows us to consider the
problem of comparability and the subsequent problem of the calculation
vs. impression of frequencies. We calculated error rate based on the per-
centage of writers with word form confusion, so, for instance, three of
forty writers. With error rate, we are looking at how many mistakes the
analyst might make if she/he is dealing with shared features in a subset of
the whole set. So we can say that the analyst might cluster three of the
forty writers incorrectly because three writers share a particular feature
which makes them indistinguishable. 
Error rate is not the same as frequency of the phenomenon within the
whole dataset. At first impression, one might be tempted to infer from the
data in Table 28 that the your/you’re confusion is very rare because only
three writers out of forty exhibit the confusion. But it is totally inaccurate
to say, for instance, that only three out of forty writers made the
your/you’re confusion, because 30 writers did not produce your at all, 38
did not produce you’re at all, and so we have no idea what their behaviour
is. In order to calculate the exact frequencies, we have to take into account
that some of these word forms do not occur in some writers’ texts at all
and we have to exclude those writers from the count. Only two writers
used both forms and used the forms your/you’re correctly. Only three
writers used your for both forms, and none of these three writers used
you’re. Even if we assume that writers who confuse the your/you’re forms
do not produce you’re consistently, we can only compare two writers to
three writers. So three out of five writers producing the your/you’re form
confuse the forms, implying that we can expect to find the your/you’re
confusion 60 per cent of the time, and more writers produce the
your/you’re confusion than do not produce the form confusion. That
means that the confusion is actually more prevalent than the correct
forms. But generalizing from such a small database of five writers is statis-
tically and linguistically dubious; with such small numbers it would not
even be possible to run a chi-square test. The main point is that we cannot
generalize from a database of forty writers about the frequency of a lin-
39
Forensic Linguistics
guistic pattern unless we know the behaviour of all forty with regard to
this particular linguistic pattern.
Replication results
The hypothesis that form confusion (word usage) errors identify authors may
be impossible to implement successfully in a forensically similar test due to
the lack of comparable data and the subsequent lack of statistically analyzable
datasets, but the data available suggest that these errors are very prevalent.
CONCLUSION
Table 28 shows the error rates of the techniques that have been empirically
tested on writers from the Writing Sample Database.

The two techniques which use linguistic analysis are far superior to the
other techniques in terms of differentiating between different authors and
clustering the questioned document with the actual author. The techniques
which draw from other language-related disciplines fail because they are
typically not usable on the kinds of short documents that are found in
forensic cases or because they simply serve another purpose which cannot
be converted to authorship identification.

Language-based author identification techniques
Finally, techniques which derive from handwriting identification and
prescriptive grammar – known as forensic stylistics – fail because they rest
on erroneous assumptions about individuality in linguistic performance.
Further, these techniques are pernicious to the development of forensic lin-
guistics because they seem so simple to explain to a jury that they bolster
the jury’s own mistakes. We can be very grateful to Judge Bassler that he
recognized the scientific and empirical weakness of forensic stylistics. 
There is much work to do, but these empirical evaluations point us in the
right direction. To that aim, documents from the Writing Sample Database
are reproduced in Appendix 3 to allow further testing and replication studies
by other researchers. 
APPENDIX 1: THE WRITING SAMPLE DATABASE
In order to test empirically current techniques for language-based author
identification, a Writing Sample Database was first assembled, as described
below. A set of four writers was extracted from the database in order to
control for sociolinguistic factors which we know affect linguistic perfor-
mance. This subset mimics the kind of data which are actually obtained in
real casework, as described below on page 43. 
The writing sample database
The database was designed to take into account both general statistical
sampling issues and linguistic performance. The decision factors for the
writers (or experimental subjects) included the availability of subjects;
writing as normal part of the subject’s lifestyle; dialect similarity or dialect
grouping; generally equivalent educational level; and representation of
both genders and several ethnicities. Based on these factors, writing
samples were collected from two groups: Criminal Justice majors at a
community college; and Business and Nursing majors at a private four-
year college. Table 29 shows the sex, age and race distributions of subjects
in the current Writing Sample Database.
The decision factors for the writing samples (or experimental tasks)
included: genre or text-type parameters; similarity to actual types of ques-
tioned documents, e.g. suicide notes, threatening/anonymous letters, etc.;
emotional level and home dialect. We know that the social context and
communicative goal of a message affect its form. There are differences
between the speech and the writing of each individual, differences between
language behaviour at home and at work, differences between language in a
letter to a friend and an essay. Based on these factors, subjects wrote, at
their leisure, on ten topics, some of which are meant to elicit enough
emotion to evoke the home dialect, while others are intended to elicit a
more formal or workplace dialect. Topics are listed in Table 30.

Language-based author identification techniques
The testing subset
In real casework, the analyst is typically given the unknown, suspect or
questioned document(s), and known writing samples from one or more
potential suspects. The task is to eliminate some or all of the suspects as
the possible author of the questioned document(s) and, if possible, to
identify one of the suspects as the possible author of the questioned doc-
ument(s). In effect, the analyst must distinguish between documents
written by different writers and cluster together documents written by the
same writer. Both the questioned and known documents are typically
short by word count; the longest document I have ever received is a 4,000-
word threatening letter. Since the investigators have already developed
suspects for independent reasons in the typical case, the task of author
identification in casework is circumscribed by the number of known sets,
and the sociolinguistic characteristics of the known writers such as age,
race, sex, and education.
The parameters of real casework have determined the design of the
empirical tests. First, the task in all the empirical tests that follow is the
same: to distinguish between different writers and to identify documents
by the same writer, some known and one unknown, using one particular
technique.
Second, the known writing samples were selected on the basis of demo-
graphic characteristics which would make the writers similar enough to
qualify as a list of suspects. Also, from a theoretical perspective, we know
that certain demographic characteristics affect linguistic performance, so a
group of people sharing these sociolinguistically significant characteristics
would very likely share dialect features. By selecting our ‘list of suspects’
so that they share group or dialect features, we can test a language-based
identification technique’s ability to go to the individual (or idiolectal)
rather than group (or dialectal) level of linguistic performance. Based on
both investigative practice and sociolinguistic fact, four writers were
selected, from the Writing Sample Database, to form the Testing Subset.
The subject identification numbers and sociolinguistic characteristics of
the four writers are shown in Table 31.
Third, as in actual casework, the writing samples from these four sub-
jects are short. The shortest text contains only 93 words, the longest, 556.
Three texts were used from subjects 001, 009 and 080, while only two
were used from subject 016, in order to keep the number of words from
the subjects relatively comparable. In this way, subjects 001 and 080, and
subjects 016 and 009, respectively, produced a comparable number of
words. Since most questioned documents are short, the goal is to test tech-
niques on short documents. In fact, it is important to develop techniques
which can operate successfully on short documents, as the worst case sce-
nario, even if long documents are available in particular cases. The textual
characteristics of the Testing Subset are shown in Table 32.
43
Forensic Linguistics
Table 32 also shows the number of words in the questioned document
(QD). The QD text was selected by an intern at the USFDOJ's National
Institute of Justice from the documents generated by the four writers,
typed into the computer, identified as SQD2. The true identity of SQD2
was not revealed until after the empirical tests were conducted. So, as the
analyst, I knew that the document was authored by one of the four writers
but not which one.

APPENDIX 2: THE DOCUMENTS USED IN THE 
EXPERIMENTAL TESTS
001-01
Giving birth to my 4th child, 3 mos too early I was in a detox center and
premature labor began. First of all, I should state I was in a detox center so
I could give birth to a healthy child. I was gripped with unbelievable terror
at the thought that my child was coming that early I didn’t feel like he
would have the opportunity to survive because I was an alcoholic and a
crack cocaine user through out the whole pregnancy. The hospital did
what they could to save the child but because of his low birth weight and
under developement he didn’t stand a chance. The whole ordeal took 12
hours from the onset of labor until the actual time of death and he died in
my arms. I was helpless and totally powerless to do anything to help or
ease his suffering. The doctors said that he didn’t suffer, but really how do
they know!! At that moment in time I believe I would have given my own
life to save his. But now as I think who would have taken care of him or
my other small children. I’m a single parent of 3 children. I believe my son
gave his life so I could live and that’s how I go on and stay clean and
chemical free.
001-02
Numerous people and events influence me everyday in different ways. As
far as me returning to school, I guess it would have to be wanting a better
quality of life for my children and myself. The only way that I knew how
to accomplish this is to return to school; and continue my education and
show my children how important an education is now, so they don’t have
to wait until they are adults to get their education. Also the current job
market had a high impact on my decision to get a degree, because there
are no jobs available that would allow me to support my family effec-
tively. We needed some financial security that a job at McDonald can’t
provide.
001-03
My Career goals is to achieve a BA in Behavioral Science Although I don’t
view it that way. I take it systematicly one thing at a time and one step at a
time. First I will recieve an AA in CJ May 96. Then I plan to switch to
Wilmington College where I plan to earn my BA who knows may I go
further and get a MA also. I hunger for the knowledge in this field because
not only do I learn of the human condition and diversity of culture, I also
learn of myself and how to handle every day problems. We are all con-
nected by some mannerism either by our uniquness or likenesses, also
there is a thin line between the two. I like knowing the why’s and that
there is not one answer to certain questions. The more I learn the more I
45
Forensic Linguistics
realize I don’t know so it keeps me coming back. I like systematic
approaches and the deviations to problems and solutions. This field has
broaden my awareness that allow for trial + error. Fairness and ‘that’s just
the way it is.’
009-01
One of the most terrifying events in my life was being held at gunpoint and
told to get in the car by two men. All I could feel was dying without Christ
in my life. I had a chance to run or get in the car. I was scared. I knew if I
dying I would to go to hell and had not made peace with God. I am from
a Christian background. So many things ran across my mind. All I could
see was this big gun that looked as if it was a cannon. I got in the car, one
drove and the other held the gun on me and told me not to look at them.
The one guy told me if I looked he would kill me. By the way, the one that
was doing all the talking didn’t rape me, but made the other guy do it. I
believe he was a pervert. I was too scared to cry but wanted the event to
end. At that time, I lived in Baltimore and girls were being raped, killed
and thrown out on the expressway or beltway. When he told me I should
take you to New Jersey, I almost lost it. I remembered my background
started praying. They finally let me go. He told me to get out and don’t
look back. I ran and ran until I reached an apartment with a light. No one
would answer the door. I knocked on the door still no one would answer.
I don’t know how I arrived at my apartment, but I did. I jumped in the
shower trying to wash his hands off but kept feeling his touch and remem-
bering what had happened. I tried to tell my husband what happened but
he was too high to listen. I didn’t call the police because I felt I would be
taken through the 3rd degree. I had seen it happen to too many women
and nothing done. So I lived with it. I think about it sometimes now, but
because Christ is in my life- that is what makes the difference! He has
taken the hurt away.
009-02
I have been influenced by many people. A boss I had was very educated,
independent, and aggressive. She was very successful and knew what she
wanted and how to obtain it. She was a go-getter, not afraid to talk to
anyone. When she appeared in a room, no matter what she was wearing,
you could see the authority she had. Most women have to wear a suit to
have that type of authority. My mother and father both have influenced
me because they always succeeded at anything they went after. They
taught me never to give up- ‘a winner is not a quitter’ and a ‘quitter is not
a winner.’ Anything you strive after you can obtain, if you work hard
enough. Even though they were unable to receive a proper education, they
instilled in me the importance of an education. Honesty and integrity as
well as respecting other feelings were also important. There are other
46
Language-based author identification techniques
people who influenced me, especially those who have had great obstacles
and other factors but still went on in spite of. There was a deaf lady that
received a Master’s Degree that influenced me because she had been a
hearing person before which is much tougher than being born that way.
She had developed a disease and lost her hearing but against all odds she
received a Master’s. According to her, she had no encouragement from
outsiders but her family was very supportive. To me, this is most
important. Family is an important factor in everyone life! Many more
people would be successful if they only had family support.
009-03
My ultimate goal is receive a BS degree in Criminal Justice. With this
degree my plans are to work extensively with juveniles and addicts. Since I
have started I have mixed emotions about exactly what to do because I
have found so many avenues to pursue in this field. I love people and con-
cerned about their well being. Since I was involved in many things in the
past but overcame them; I feel can be an asset to many people. Counseling
has always been a desire but I had a family and they were more important
at the time. People have always felt comfortable talking to me and relating
their problems. I feel comfortable talking to anyone. I never been afraid to
start a conversation. Therefore, counseling would be ideal. Another career
goal is to own a bookstore with coffee shop (Gourmet) and a boutique. I
love to shop but I hate to see too many of the same kind. Boutiques are
unique, since they usually only have one or two of the same item, so much
different from a department store. I would like to return to my first goal,
education is priceless. Many times jobs are not obtained due to lack of
education. I always have told my siblings, ‘don’t ever give a person an
opportunity not to hire you because of the lack of education or qualifi-
cation.’ My oldest daughter obeyed my advice and completed. My son
enlisted in the army, married and then entered workforce. Now he is pur-
suing his career in criminal justice. My youngest daughter has enlisted in
the army after in the workforce for a few years. Maybe she will also take
my advice and pursue a career and attend College. More important than
all of the above I must be a success in my ministry. I would like to be a
success in leading many teens, or anyone hurting, to Christ. After all is
done, career, family etc. we all must give an account to Jesus as to what
have we done for him and with him when He was offered to them. Our
goals are only temporal to get us through this life! Most important, where
will you spend eternity. God Bless!
016-01
I guess my most terrifying feeling is not being here for my two sons. My
own mother died when I was 30, and I’ve always thought that I’ve shel-
tered and protected my sons as much, or more, than mom did me, I was
47
Forensic Linguistics
the youngest of 4, and if I left this world early, I’m not sure how my boys
would function. Both emotionally and physically. Emotionally, we are a
very close threesome, relying and depending almost solely on one another,
with me being a focal point for problems they find themselves unable to
deal with. We talk about everything together, and I always find it amazing
when their peers say things like ‘my mom doesn’t treat me like yours’- I
treat my kids as people who need structoring, raising and guidance- not as
kids who ‘belong’ to me. I wonder -if I die- who my boys would hash over
the week’s happenings with. Who would they turn to for guidance and
understanding- my family is of little help because I’ve raised my sons so
differently- the boys father’s family is of no help- they’re far away and
don’t even know the two guys. Physically -my boys have been sheltered,
once again- from the cruel realities of today’s world. At the ages of 16 and
20, they are only now becoming financially responsible, I have raised them
to respect a dollar, but they are only now beginning to learn where that
dollar has to go before it can go where they want it to go. If I left my
children now- they would be alone in that I have kept them mine- I have
not involved them in financial matters, I have not forced them to accept
and be with family members who do not see our ‘way’- my kids would
survive -I have taught them that- but it would not be an easy survival- I
worry for them- jobs are scarce, cost of living rises more each day- Being a
parent is a very real fear.
016-02
I think my mother influenced me more than anyone. As a child, we were
taught a lot of values but in ways that most kids couldn’t pick up on. Like
-we were seldom told ‘no’- we were told things like ‘if you choose to do
such and such, these are the results, you make your decision. As teenagers
we were given the choice to hang out where we wanted, with whom we
wanted but we were told things like ‘if your grandmother sees you there,
would she be proud and say ‘hi’?’ Or, ‘you are who you’re seen with’- We
were also seldom threatened, she did just as she said she was going to do-
we knew that if she said she was going to pour cold water on us next time
we didn’t get up out of bed on time- that is exactly what she would do- no
second chance. Two stories that stick out in my mind are: she got tired of
my sister and I arguing over who’s turn it was to do the dishes; she said if
we couldn’t decide, she would solve the problem and decide for us- as
kids, we never seem to learn, so the next nite, the same old s__t, and the
next thing we knew- mom had opened up the window next to the table
and thrown all of the dinner dishes out the window onto the lawn- she
turned to us and said ‘now neither one of you have to do dishes- there are
none left to wash- your only problem now is to explain this to your father
when he gets home’ (he was a truck driver.) The other thing I remember
well is: I seldom ‘thought’ to hang up my coat when I got home from
48
Language-based author identification techniques
school, it was always laying on a chair, or on the couch, -anywhere but
where it should have been- She kept telling me to take care of it -finally she
told me if I didn’t, she was throwing it out in the snow. Well, one morning
in January, I asked her where my coat was, and, you guessed it- in the
Snowbank outside the kitchen door- left there from the nite before- I was
born and raised in Houlton, Maine- in January, in Maine, it’s pretty damn
cold- Mom taught us to stand up for our beliefs, try to walk away from an
arguement, and to treat others as you want to be treated. The other two
people who have influenced my life are my 2 sons- I have raised them by
myself and it has been interesting, heartbreaking, thankless, and one hell
of an experience. But I wouldn’t trade that experience for a ship full of
hundred dollar bills. They have taught me to laugh from the inside, to look
at the world from the ground up, and to never loose sight of who I am and
who I’ll be. Having those 2 has taught me to respect my own feelings, to
show them (my feelings) in a way I can be comfortable with later- and to
hold onto my goals- never loose sight of the future- the past is what made
us what we are today- and mom was right ‘Someday I’ll thank her for what
she did’.

The scariest thing in my life was when the doctor told me I had to have a
hysterectomy because my pap smear revealed positive cancer cells. My fear
and the unknowing were awful. Would I have to have chemotherapy or
radiation? Would I lose my hair. Would I die, and if so, how much would I
suffer? I guess he noticed the fear in my eyes and tried to assure me that
the cells were probably localized, but I was not buying this. He tried to
assure me and calm my fears by stating that by removing my uterus, the
cancer cells would not spread. The two weeks waiting for the surgery were
hell. How would my children be if I died? Who would be there for them?
I loved them so much and wanted to see them grow into adults. Most of
the time I was scared- couldn’t concentrate and cried when I was alone. At
other times, I felt guilty for being so selfish. I would scold myself and tell
myself that I had no control over this and it was out of my hands and I
should just accept whatever happened. But the fear of the unknown is
stronger than rational thought, and would rear its ugly head. Years later, I
guess my scariest moment was unfounded- but who knows for sure? The
scariest thing in my life so far has been the question of immortality.
080-02
My third grade teacher influenced me greatly. She was very intelligent,
warm, and funny. She encouraged me and in so doing instilled confidence
in me which up to that point was lacking. Because of her, I became a better
student and proud of my accomplishments. Because of her quiet and
praising manner, I loved going to school and tried harder to please her so
49
Forensic Linguistics
she would bestow her warmth and praise on me. Through her guidance, I
excelled that year, and became more aware of what I could achieve if I
applied myself.
080-03
My career goal is to land a position where I could become free of working
two jobs as I have in the past. I would like this to be a management
position as I enjoy this. In addition, I am fond of travel, so this would be
an asset as I am willing to relocate. Office management or human resource
management are areas of interest to me. My goal is obtaining either of
these positions with a corporation providing employee benefits. Primarily,
however, I am interested in a Monday to Friday job that would provide an
adequate salary so I could enjoy weekends.
SQD2
A lot of things anger me but nothing makes me really angry. I’ve pondered
this question for a couple of hours and can’t come up with one single
factor. I can describe lots of small, irritating examples - but no one large
‘thing’. Injustice makes me angry- treating all people the same in any
system- people are all different- all circumstances are different- no one
person is exactly like another- stereo typing people- that makes me angry-
commercials on TV that ask for money to feed starving kids over seas
makes me angry (Sally Struthers looks like she could give up a meal or
two)- has anyone really looked in their own neighborhood lately? What
about those kids down the street? Maybe they’re hungry, too. People who
are capable of working but dont - or won’t- make me angry- kids who say
‘I can’t’ make me angry- people who live in perfect worlds- created by
money- make me angry. Disease -espeically cancer- makes me angry.
Cancer stole my mother at 52, and she never harmed a single living thing-
and bore such pain, never complained- her death made me very angry-
Families who don’t appreciate one another make me angry. Wives who
take advantage of their mate- and vice versa- make me angry. Our
country’s system of child support paying makes me angry- one person
suffers, one person gains- and the kid gets nothing -is often the case. Or
like my children- no support at all- and no help from welfare- because I
lived with my parents, or because I ‘make too much money:- is that after
taxes? No, that’s before Uncle Sam takes his share- Incompetence in the
work place makes me angry. If you can;t do the job- let someone who can
do it, do it- Blacks who use ‘prejudice’ like the term ‘thank-you’ make me
angry. Whites who can’t envision a black president make me angry. people
who don’t vote make me angry- Seaford’s school system makes me angry.
Kids who go to college and goof off, make me angry.

To the makers of Always Sanitary napkins. Why do you people keep
changing your product? Where do you get these women who tell you what
‘s best and do any of them have a physical labor job working with a high
ratio of men? And just where are you suppose to put the used napkin while
you ‘re putting the new one on before you can roll the used one up in that
sticky plastic? Do your test women have extra hands? Just when I thought
I had finally found a pad that didn’t feel like a 10 pound brick in my
underwear, you jokers changed the design – for bigger and better service –
O.K. – but what’s with the ‘Wings’ – are these things suppose to fly – or
serve a purpose? Not every women in America hemorrages on a monthly
basis – some of us actually have a mild flow for a couple of days, and then
a spot or two - and then we’re done – we d n’t all bleed half to death and
need a full size diaper complete with wings and wonder weave. And while
I’m at it - what ‘s with the yard long pad? Who really needs all that length?
If you really want to please women - talk to some who work side by side
with men - ask them if there’s a solution to how to get these things to the
bathroom unnoticed - and why do the darn things smell so bad? I know
some odor is bound to be present – but, geez, – some of these things knock
over a Lysol can Before you wear them! And, good God, the price. Logi-
cally speaking - you know we’re gonna buy ‘em - so why the hell do they
cost more than a 6 pack of beer? Can it really cost that much to make
them? Thank God you haven’t decided to recycle them, tho’ – I will say
that much. But that dry weave stuff – it was a good idea – but ... the length
and holding thing - Don’t you think you got more than a little carried
away? Maybe you should stick with packaging, disguise that sucker - or
something - I work closely, in a factory, with a lot of men - I don’t carry a
purse - where am I suppose to put that thing to get it to the bathroom?
God knows, the ones from the bathroom despinser are as rough as sand
paper, as thick as Black’s Law Dictionary, and as comfortable as the old
fashioned belt thing my mother used to wear. Come to think of it - maybe
you have made some improvements, after all.

I am writing to find out why you have denied the enclosed claim for the
emergency room. On Thursday, September 10, I awoke with a headache
and what I assumed was an earache, caused by chronic sinus problems. I
work at DuPont in Seaford, Swing shift, and I had just worked 5 nites of
12 midnite - 8 a.m., with 2 more to go. I awoke @ around 5 p.m. - not
feeling well, so I took 2 tylenol, assumed I had not got my sleep out, and
went back to bed. I slept, very uneasily, for another hour or so, and still
51

feeling bad, decided to lay down on the sofa in the living room for awhile.
I got back up at around 6:30 p.m- layed on the sofa- and dozed for a
while- probably another half hour - or so- by 8 o’clock, the whole left side
of my face was tingly, and by 8:15- I couldn’t hold my head up, I was so
weak and shaking. My vision was blurred, my left side was going numb,
and my fiance loaded -literally carried- me to the emergency room. He
signed me in- I don’t remember much about it- and the nurses took me
back to the examining office- I was given a shot for pain- examined and
sent home to see my dr. in the a.m- they told me at the emergency room I
had an acute ear infection- all nite long, every 4 hours- I awoke in horrible
pain- and begged my fiance to give me more pain killers. In the a.m., he
rushed me to my allergy-sinus specialist and I was diagnosed as having a
severe migraine headache- at this point- if they would have shot me, I
would have been happy. My ENT doctor gave me a double shot of a pain
killer, and some medicine intravenously to open up constricted vessells
that cause migraines. The 2 shots worked, but I -quite literally- slept for 3
days- which is why I didn’t call your office within 48 hours- and my fiance
knew nothing of any of this calling business- I pay for this insurance- I was
very ill- and I believe this claim should be paid, in full, with or without a
phone call to your office within 48 hours. I will pursue this issue- I believe
my rights have been violated- please attend to this matter immediately.

I am really sorry that things have ended up this way. I know that even tho
you and Chris have your differences, you still love him- the saying of
blood is thicker than water will always be true. As for he and Deena, well...
I can say this- Deena is the one who holds a grudge- Chris is willing to let
dead dogs lie- he’ll never say he’s sorry- because he meant every word he
said- so he’s not sorry- I am- because I didn’t expect that when your
daughter moved home from Florida, that I would lose my best friend. I
have no guilt fellings- personally- over what happened, I was not even
there and have heard only Chris’ side- and part of your mom’s- but I do
know- if you and Chris are able to get along- regardless- why is it Deena-
who also- wasn’t there- is allowed to carry on so rediculously? She’s living
in your house, eating your food, saving no money- what makes her situ-
ation any different than Chris’? And why did she drag me into it? Because
I’m his girlfriend? Or is she just being an ass? I feel bad that we re no
longer friends. I miss our laughs, our shopping trips, the 4 of us- you, les,
me + Chris- or even you, Deena, me + Chris- playing cards. I hate not
going to visit you because Deena is rude to me- and to Chris- I hate not
being able to go places with you, because Deena is rude- Do you see a
pattern in this? I know that you think Chris is an ass- but ... are your
daughter’s actions any better? As for the way you treat Chris- he assures
me it’s alrite- not that he likes or accepts it- just for me to let it slide. You
52
Language-based author identification techniques
know that, after three years, I’m going to take his side- right? I may not
like his point of view- but I’ll still back him and support him. You used to
accept that- but that was pre- Deena home from Florida, I guess. I’m sorry
that she has been allowed to put such a wedge in your family. And she has,
you know- and I’ll tell you this- I blame her for a hell of a lot more than I
blame Chris- her conscience- if she has one- should bother her when she
goes to bed at nite. She ain’t so hot either, you know. No one is perfect-
just forgiven.

I am very happy to be a part of your life. I know that it is hard for you to
let anyone get close to you, I’m glad you chose me to be some one special.
We have our faults and disagreements, our relationship is not perfect, and
neither are we- but I think we can overcome our differences and become a
couple- with patience, understanding, caring, and time. I don’t expect
much from you- I like to be held, hugged, and talked to- I like to know
that I’m special to you- and I like to be told that you care. You should
never assume that I know- because just when you assume I know- is when
I ‘ll get insecure and feel like you don’t care. And please, don’t take our
relationship for granted- or me- nothing is just handed to you- you have to
work for everything you get- and work hard. Attend to my needs, and I’ll
do my best to attend to yours. Give me my space, and I’ll do the same for
you. Never give me an order- but always request what you feel I’m capable
of. Never ‘leave it for me’ because I won’t ‘leave it for you’- I’m not that
way- if the trash needs taken out- I do it- I don’t ‘leave it for anyone.’
Make up the bed if you’re the last one out of it and it bothers you that it’s
unmade- because I have far too much on my mind to worry about whether
the bed is made or not- I’m just going to get back into it, anyway. I will
always take time for you- no matter what else is pressing- or what time it
is- please do the same for me- Remember that I have feelings- and I’ll
remember that you do, too. Never judge my emotions- lots of times I can’t
control them- and I encourage you to show your emotions- I won’t laugh,
or criticize- I promise. And it’s O.K. to cry- it makes me feel better- it
might help you, too. You can be strong and cry- one has nothing to do with
the other. Accept my faults- and I’ll accept yours- love me for who I am-
not what you want me to be. Remember- our backgrounds have made us
different- our ancestors have taught us different- be prepared for those dif-
ferences- Once again, that’s what makes us who we are. Don’t be afraid to
say ‘I ‘m sorry’- and I’ll be the same way- but I won’t apologize if I’m right
and I know it- I’m very stubborn. I’m very spoiled- but I’m happy- and I
want you to be, too.

I guess the most terrifying thing for me is the passing away of someone.
53
Forensic Linguistics
When I was growing up in a very small community in upstate- N.Y. there
was not a lot do, I guess for adults there was probably even less to do than
for children. My father turned to alcohol and was very abusive. My
Mother, brother & myself would hide under the bed not to be found. We
would have to climb out the window when he would go to the celler to get
a gun. I can remember him wanting to bring his friends home from the
VFW to go to bed with me and I was only 9 yrs. old. My Mother would
never let him and I remember those terrible fights. Needless to say my
father and I never got along very well but my Mother who is still my best
friend to this day held us together. I ended up doing very poor in school
and was absent a lot. I mentioned my brother who is 5 yrs. older than me.
My father would get drunk and pull him out of bed and try to beat him up
because my brother was very athletic and extremely smart. Again my 5
foot Mom would get between my brother and Father who was 6 foot 2 in.
Many years later my parents divorced much to my happiness and my
brothers dismay. My Mother met a nice Man that treats her the way she
always deserved- My brother saw it for 7 very long years of truly breaking
the family up. I say 7 years because he wouldn’t talk to anyone in the
family. He had cut off all ties. My father, besides being a heavy drinker,
was also a heavy smoker. He became very ill and was in the hospital alot. I
knew what my father had done in the past but he was the best father he
could have been. I had always felt bad for him basically growing up with
no parents at all. I would visit him, read to him, hold his hand and tell him
about his grandchildren that the nurses let me sneak in to see him every
once in awhile. My brother lived in Maryland and could never find time to
see him, although they had become very close. I remember calling him and
telling him how bad he looked but he still wouldn’t come to see him. One
night I visited kind of late. He looked bad and you know how they say you
can smell death- well you could. I held his hand and said I love you and he
said he loved me too. That was the first time in 21 yrs. he had said that to
me. The next day he died. I handle bad things by sleeping at the drop of a
hat -I slept a lot that Nov. and I had dreams of my father and I floating in
blue skies and I was always trying to tell him, it was okay, he was dead he
needed to go on. He would smile and say he knew. Those kind of dreams
are different for me because ever since A child I always had true night
terrors -and still do. I still wake up crying, screaming. But those about my
father were okay -he seemed happy. Eight years or so later my Gramma
who was 99 yrs. old passed away. She was ill for a long time. When I was
growing up I would spend weekends there (at her house) to be away from
my father. She would sing and make us treats. She could also be kind of
mean always yelling over nothing. But she was raising a second family -her
son’s while he worked. When she passed away I had already been living
here for almost three years. I had been back a couple times to see her. I had
been playing cards with my husband when I got the call. I said thank you
54
Language-based author identification techniques
and continued on playing cards. I was pretty much okay about. She had
been suffering and had no idea what was going on. I did become depressed
though and I couldn’t really put my finger on it. In my dreams these ter-
rible black holes represented my Grandmother. Something just felt so
wrong. Going to NY I was feeling somewhat better but the closer we got to
NY the more I started to cry not because of grief but because of dread. My
Grandma to me seemed upset, unhappy about something. I never felt so
relieved getting back to Delaware. But the night terrors seemed worse-
almost like my Grandma had opened away for my father to get back. Once
I woke up crying and went to go to the bathroon and thought I saw him
standing in the hall way waiting for me. Recently I had a dream about my
husbands Mother dying. I felt so much pain for her. Maybe I’m afraid to
be alone, I don’t know. My sons teacher was just killed recently in a car
accident and he seems to be dealing with it okay. I am there for him at
anytime if he needs to talk. All I know is these dreams about people
passing or the night terrors- that I am so awake in my dreams I will get up
feeling like I never slept at all and even say why are you waking me up I
didnt go to bed. I tend to handle things inwardly. Maybe they come out
through my dreams- I have too many people counting on me to not before
them. I was sexually assaulted by an adult neighbor and I still think I see
him every once in awhile even though I know he is in N.Y. Thank you for
letting me get this all out!

That is a tough one. I have always admired Uncles. I will tell you about a
couple of them and why they influenced me. My Uncle Bob, in N.Y. was
Police of Chief and Chief of investorgators. I can remember seeing him
walking the streets or as I would later find out, he was walking his beat.
He was always a happy man for the job he did. He was a towing man who
reminded you of a Grandfather figure. We had a local drunk who would
just wander. I can remember my Uncle Bob always buying him some food
and something to drink. He never expected anything in return. The N.Y.
Police (actually) Saratoga Police Dept. did not pay very well at all so he
couldn’t do much more than that for him except give him friendship and
to see that no harm came his way while he was on -and- off duty. I never
really remember him talking about his job too much, He never really put
much on the negitive things of his job but focused on the positive side and
that’s what he mostly talked about. He once told me if you really want to
help make a difference- work with juvieneles or become a cop that works
with the community. He has since passed away but my favorite image of
him is him walking his beat, stopping & talking to someone and patting
them on the back. He also had his card with number on it in case someone
needed him. My Other Uncle is my Uncle Jack. He is my mothers brother.
We used to spend a lot of time at his house on the weekends because my
55
Forensic Linguistics
father drank. He would take us in to be safe -mentally & physically. Not to
mention he was living with his mother because his wife left him and their
three small daughters. When his oldest daughter was 17 she became
pregnant and he helped her raise the baby. He sacrafised (sp?) as much as I
have ever seen anyone scarafice. At one point he had money to buy a small
piece of land and to build his own house but because of his mother didn’t
want to- because it was too far out in the country- he didn’t and ended up
buying a trailer in a trailer Park. All through this he remained a happy and
up beat person. He was someone you could draw strength from. He would
say- unfortunately there is always someone else worse off than you. The
Other people Who Influence me know, are my Children. I have three very
different Children! Sometimes I wonder if they met on the play ground if
they would even become friends. Dustin my oldest is 12 1/2 yrs. old. He is
probably more like me than the other two. He is very headstrong in his
belief of being fair and treating each other appropiately. I’m a little more
rigid though. He says I’m a left brain person- someone who is usually
serious most of the time. He is much more relaxed and enjoys having fun
and telling jokes. I admire that. He just seem very focused and can knows
when to be silly and when not to be. He doesn’t know it, but he shows me
how to be a little more relaxed and maybe be a little more right brain as he
puts it. My other son is Nicholas and he is 11 yrs. old. When he was 3 yrs.
old- he completely stopped growing and gaining weight. That was the size
he was going to be for life until one Dr. Decided to test him for a growth
Hormone definecey- which I passed down to him. He went through a
couple hospital stays and at the age of 5 yrs. old started growth shots. He
spent a lot of time with Kids Who had cancer and would be in the
playroom and would be sick- The mother of one was kind of embarrased
and said she was bring her daughter back to the room and it was Nick who
said please don’t do that and he went over and played with her. the way he
treats others that have problems influences others not to be cruel. My
youngest child is a girl. She is 9 yrs. old and her name is Jessica. Jessica also
takes growth hormon shots and wears a back brace 12 hr. a day. She is 4
feet tall but only weighs about 40 lbs. She is beautiful but other kids in her
class tend to pick on her but she stands her ground and tells them that it is
their problem. They all influence me to see things in more than just one
way and I also get terrific positive strength from them.

On the night before Christmas Eve, at 9:00 PM, the phone rang. I was
living with my Mom and we were getting ready for bed- my mom was in
the bathtub. We were talking about everything we needed to do to get
ready for Christmas and what last minute shopping we had to do. On the
phone was a nurse, saying that my sister had just been brought in to emer-
gency room by Ambulance. She had been in a car accident and the nurse
56
Language-based author identification techniques
would have the doctor call as soon as there was more information. The
hospital was 1 1/2-2 hours away. Waiting for that phone call back from the
doctor was horrible. All kinds of questions ran through our heads. Why
was my sister there? How did the accident happen? How bad was she
hurt? Would she have to stay in the hospital? Who, if any, family members
should we call? My mom and I had no money. We had just gotten paid but
didn’t get off work in time to make it to the bank. Would we have to stay
overnight? It seemed like it had been hours and doctor still hadn’t called.
We packed an overnight bag just in case. We called our jobs and made
arrangements so we wouldn’t have to be there the next day. When the
doctor finally called- he said that she was going to be okay but she had
some head trauma, and that she was in X-Ray and he wouldn’t know any
more until he got the X-rays back. He gave us directions to the hospital.
Luckily mom had filled her car up with gas on her way home. On the way
there, I couldn’t drive fast enough. I kept thinking -what if something hap-
pened to my sister before we got there? What were we in for when we got
there. I was very protective of my mom. I saw the heartache she went
through when my grandmother died and I didn’t want to see her go
throught that again- but I knew I couldn’t keep her from it. The ride took
forever. It was dark and cold and abanded. No one else was on the road-
and by the time we got there, it was Christmas Eve. We were in a big city
that we didnt know. I didn’t look like the good part of town. We found the
hospital but couldn’t find a parking space. We ended up parking 3 blocks
away in a parking garage. Mom and I ran to a hospital door where we saw
an ambulance sitting. We both stopped outside the door to get ourselves
together- To try to put our fears underneath and to prepare for the worst
of what we would find. We walked in the door and immediately ran into a
desk. The nurse there told us where my sister was. We starting walking
down the hallway, scared, frightened. Just before we opened the door to
the room, we heard this voice -faint, scared, quivering, calling ‘MOM!’
My sister was in the waiting room outside -waiting for us. She couldn’t
stand being in the room by herself- beatup -scratched, stitched, and just as
scared as we were.

My mother has been the most influential person in my life. I am the oldest
child of 3, with a younger brother and sister. We grew up relatively poor
and with an alcoholic father. I don’t remember too much of my childhood
until I was about 9 or 10 years old and thats when I remember my mom
becoming a very strong figure in my life. We were living in a very rural
area, our nearest neighbor was a quarter mile down the road. Dad started
drinking alot and spending his time away from home. Mom stayed home
until my little sister started kindergarten. She found a job making $50.00 a
week, and a job I considered to be well beneath her. She saved money and
57
Forensic Linguistics
bought a car -an old dark green metallic Impala. When she she started
working, I had to help out more around the house and with the kids. Mom
had to work late one night and Grandmom would come over and be with
us kids until Mom got home. Mom found another job and the she got a job
working for the state as a prison guard. She finally had a decent paying job
with benefits. She managed to save enough money to hire a lawyer and file
for divorce. The divorce was a tough change, but a good one. Now it was
just the 4 of us and we had to really come together. We went through alot
of rough times- but Mom was always there. She was there when my
brother had asthma attacks and had to be taken to the emergency room.
She was there on the first day of school; when we got home she bake
home-made chocolate chip cookies. She was there to help us with our
homework. She was at the school when we had problems there. I fell in
gym class and tore the cartilage in my knee. She came to the school to pick
me up, in full uniform. She was there at my brothers boy scout meetings.
The only mom amongst a sea of fathers; while my father was 5 blocks
away getting drunk. She was there for our band and chorus concerts. She
was there during a blizzard, with no electric, no phone, no water; and the
state wanting to send a helicopter to take her to work. She was always
there. She never yelled, never hit us, never showed her anger, never
showed her weak moments, never cried, and never gave up. My father has
always said I’m just like my mother- I hope I am. She is my hero and my
best friend.
020-03
I would like to someday work with children and victims. I grew up in a
home environment that was poverty- level and alcohol -addicted On
behalf of my father. Somehow, someway, my mom, my brother, my sister,
and myself have managed to come out of those risk factors better people,
good people. I want to learn how we managed to do that but more impor-
tantly, I would like to help other children and other families going through
Crisis. Maybe to share some of the things I have been through. Maybe to
let them know that they are not alone. that are people have been and are
going through the same things. I would like to be able to show the strength
in me that my mother showed of herself. I would like to be able to make a
difference in a life- especially a child, the way my mom made a difference
for me. I know that if I get a job doing this, its going to be hard to detach
from the situation and the people. That is going to be something I’m going
to have to work very hard at. Maybe I would like to teach a hard-core
bone-head cop that he’s making a very big impression of peoples lives and
that his actions or inactions are going to be very important to someones
life- if not alot of people. I wish that all officers would have some sym-
pathy and empathy and treat people in crisis with respect. But then again,
people in Crisis need to realize that an officer can only do so much within
58
Language-based author identification techniques
his job. And that officers are people too and they have Crisis themselves.
There are alot of things going on in the world today- poverty, addiction,
homelessness, abuse, racism, prejudice, and on and on. I would like to help
out some small people to deal with all that. To help them work through
the maze of all stuff, including what may be going on in their life. To help
some small person realize that they are a person too and need to be
remembered that they are a person.

The most terrifying situation I was in was a drug raid. I went to go visit a
friend I had with w/ the past summer. I did not know his house was being
watched for drugs. We were all sitting in the living room. When all of
sudden the police came through the door and had a shot guns to our heads
yelling everyone on the floor. At first I thought it was just a good practical
joke. Then I realized that it was not a joke this was for real. All I could
think of is how my mother always telling me that you can always be in the
wrong place at the wrong time. We were all lying on the floor and the
police officers started handcuffing us. That was one of the most depressing
times of my life. All I was worryed about was my father finding out. The
sad part was all I was doing was visiting a friend and now I’m a suspect in
a drug raid. Some people who I had come w/ and I were ask if we were
going to help the police w/out calling our lawers, because we had nothing
on us and were not in arms reach of anything. Riding in back of the police
car on the way to the station all I could think about was what if my name
is printed in the newspaper? Will I get kicked out of school? Will other
parents not want me hanging around their children? I know I was doing
nothing wrong but in a lot of people’s eyes it doesn’t matter I was there
and that is all I know. They would say what were you doing there anyway.
I ‘m sorry but not all my friends live in high class neighborhoods. I don’t
pick my friends on where they live. I know a lot of people who are not law
abiding citizens. But that doesnt’ mean they are not good people. Some
people have different value beliefs from me, but that doesn’t mean I ‘m
going to start beleaving their’s. We got to the station and the worst thing
they handcuffed us to a bench. I felt I had lost all my freedom for nothing.
I had done nothing wrong. Then one of the first thoughts that came to my
mind was if I was Black would I have been sent to SCI and not even been
asked to coroperate at the town level. Well everything worked out o.k.
they had nothing on us and we were let go. Comes to find out the local
police messed up the whole raid b/c the warrent was not signed and on the
wrong date.
024-02
Someone who influenced me is my mom. I grew up watching my mother
work all the time. She work a lot so my sister and I could have eveything.
59
Forensic Linguistics
There was a lot of times we had no money but she still seem to get what
we needed. I grew up my whole life with people telling me what a won-
derful mother I had. I knew it was the true but I still was mad b/c we
missed a lot of time together b/c she was always working or had something
to do. My mom is a case manager who also used to coach special
olyempics. We would try to sit down to eat dinner and the phone would
ring all during dinner. I used to get really upset and ask her ‘Don’t they
know you have a family also.’ I think it would hurt her and I didn’t mean
to hurt her. I guess I just wanted some of her atteneetion. When I was
young, I didn’t realized how much she helped other people and how they
depend on her so much. Till I got older and she was nonimated. for a
nation wide event for an outstanding employee. Because money was low
my mom had to get a second job as a foster parent. The foster child was
profoundly retarded, he couldn’t even hold him self up. Now it is ten years
later and no amount of school could teach me what my mother has. With
living with a handycapped people for majority of my life I learned to be
thankful that I am not disabled and to help people who are. My mother
taught me not to judge people by their race or apperence b/c you never
know who they are. She told me a story one time. She was walking out of
some building in Washington, D.C. and there was a elderly man dress very
poorly and kind of stumbling. She said that he looked like a bum. He had
a lot of books in his hands so she asked him if he needed any help. Comes
to find out he was a big time scientist for the government. My mom alway
would pick-up this oldder man who would always hichhicked in Lewes,
and I would alway ask her ‘Why do you alway pick him up.’ and she tell
me. ‘There are alot of people who are less fercanite than you and If you
can help someone you do b/c one day someone will help you.’ My mom
instilled alot of beliefs in me that I think children of today need. They
were not religious, they were just things that often humans need to do. To
this day when someone needs help, I try to help them. When I help
someone, I get this glowing inside of me and It makes me feel great about
myself b/c I’m giving back to the world. The most important thing she
taught me is to treat people an the way you want to be treated.

My career goal is to one day have my masters in Social Work. A lot of
people say why there is no money in that field. I know there is not alot of
money, but I don’t want to do it for the money. I like to help people and
wouldn’t it be the best feeling in the world to know you help to create +
structure, clean-up peoples lives. To have children grow-up in homes that
are friendly and can be understood in. I know it is not easy and it take a lot
of emotional strain on a person. I should know I’ve lived with it my whole
life. My mom is a case manager. She was always bring home clients. She
works for DMR. So a lot of the clients were serverly handicapped, but my
60
Language-based author identification techniques
mom still made them do the same stuff as any non-handicapped person
would do. Sometimes people would say she was to hard on her clients but
no one would push them to know their true limitations. Right now I’m
going to Del tech to get my accosiate degree in human services. Then I’m
going to probly Del State to get my BSW. Then I’ll probly get a job to get
some expirence and work my way through my masters program.

I would have to say that the most terrifying experience of my life was the
day I had to make the admission that I was desperately in need of psychi-
atric treatment. I had been a severe clinical depressive for approximately
10 years before I could admit to others, and most importantly myself that
I had a problem I could not correct on my own. There is such a stigma
attached to psychiatric treatment in our society. All I could think about
were the ramifications through out the rest of my life if I sought help from
a psychiatrist. I am already feeling the negative affects of my decision. I
have been informed that if you have ever been under psychiatric
treatment, it automatically precludes you from employment as a police
officer or a probation/parole officer in this state. Basically, my nightmare is
being realized now, because I cannot fulfill a lifelong goal of mine. In my
mind I know that the problem I had was purely a medical one, however,
government institutions view the problem as me being mentally deficient.
I had a very traumatic childhood- my father was terminally ill the majority
of my life, and my mother’s way of dealing with that was alcoholism and
abusiveness. Instead of resorting to a life of crime and using my past as an
excuse for comitting crimes, I decided to go for help. I will be penalized
for that decision for the rest of my life, and I find the whole experience
degrading and completely unfair...

My father was probably the single most influencial person in my life. My
father was a very hard working, dependable, honest, caring and giving
man. He spent his entire life doing without so he could provide for others,
including: family, friends, neighbors, acquaintances and strangers. My
father lived his entire life by the adage -’what you put out into the lives of
others comes back into your own’. He instilled those values in me prior to
his death in 1990. My father was a very strong willed, proud man. He was
very highly respected by all who knew him, and I sincerely hope that I can
grow to become half as good of person as he was. When I was in high
school I was useless. I did nothing. More importantly, I never accom-
plished anything to make my father proud, and I have a great deal of
unresolved feelings about that. However, 6 months before my father
passed away, he gave me the money to take two correspondence classes to
acquire my high school diploma. All he asked of me was that I complete
61

those classes to the best of my ability. I did. However, as time went by after
my father’s death, I came to realize some very important things. All my
father ever wanted was for me to utilize my potential. To be my own per-
sonal best and to be proud of myself. I have made the conciensous sp?
decision to come back to college and be the best I can be. To be proud of
myself for quite possibly the first time in my life. And if I couldn’t do it
while my father was here, maybe I still can make him proud even though
he has gone. He is what motivates me to face each new day, and probably
will continue to do so for the rest of my life.

I intend to get into forensic psychology. Here at Del Tech I am pursuing an
associates degree in criminal justice. After graduation, I intend to pursue a
Batchelor’s degree in Human Behaviour and a Masters degree in Psy-
chology. Eventually I hope to obtain a Doctorate in Forensic Psychology. I
have always been intrigued by the mind of a murderer. I would like to
attempt to understand what it is that drives some of us to take another
human life, yet prevents others of us from taking that one extra step to
murder. I have done a considerable amount of research and reading on this
topic, and I find that the more educated I become in this particular area,
the more interested I am. This is not a career choice that you can walk
right into. Therefor, I intend to start my career in Corrections counseling
locally. I have deep rooted personal beliefs about our nation’s corrections
system. I do not feel as though there is nearly enough emphasis put on
rehabilitation in our country, and there is NO emphasis at all in the State
of Delaware. Rehabilitation in the State of Delaware is nonexistent. I hope
to help inmates in the Delaware Corrections System in a variety of ways. I
would like to help them deal with there emotions and impulse control; i.e.
anger management, etc. I would like to familiarize inmates with psychi-
atric treatment. I would also like to familiarize them with the myriad of
community resources that are available to them that the majority don’t
even know exist. My biggest priority is helping them prepare for the tran-
sition back into society. I feel as though we (the general public) should put
forth a sincere effort to help inmates with reintegration into society. If
normal, average people would start giving convicted felons jobs and
opportunities and maybe even just a little faith, the recidivism rate would
decrease dramatically.

NOTES
1 In oral argument, the prosecution withdrew its proffer of Fitzgerald as an expert
in forensic stylistics and instead proffered him as a text analysis expert; this
change in title did not, however, change Fitzgerald’s method based on forensic
stylistics as represented by McMenamin (1993). 
2 Recent rules and rulings on the admissibility of scientific and technical evidence
through the testimony of expert witnesses include Federal Rule of Evidence 702
(FRE 702); Federal Rule of Evidence 403 (FRE 403), and the empirical relia-
bility standard set by the US Supreme Court’s opinion in Daubert v. Merrell
Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 US 593 (1993) and extended in Kumho Tire Co.
v. Carmichael, 526 US 137 (1999). FRE 702 requires that the expert must (a)
qualify as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training or education; (b)
testify to scientific, technical or other specialized knowledge; and (c) must assist
the trier of fact. FRE 403 excludes testimony that may introduce the danger of
unfair prejudice, confuse the issues or mislead the jury. The Daubert criteria
include ‘(1) whether a method consists of a testable hypothesis; (2) whether the
method has been subject to peer review; (3) the known or potential rate of error;
(4) the existence and maintenance of standards controlling the technique’s oper-
ation; (5) whether the method is generally accepted; (6) the relationship of the
technique to methods that have been established to be reliable; (7) the qualifica-
tions of the expert witness based on the methodology; (8) the non-judicial uses
of the method (Daubert, 509 US 595). Berger (2000) admirably explains the
legal complexity of these trends in admissibility; Solan (1999) indicates how
these rulings may apply to linguistic experts.

4 ALIAS® (Automated Linguistic Identification of Authorship System) is software
I developed during my tenure as a Visiting Research Fellow at the United States
Department of Justice, National Institute of Justice, Office of Science and Tech-
nology. ALIAS® functions as both a database and a parser; it requires human
interaction at various decision points throughout the parsing because accuracy is
far more important than speed in forensic work. The software currently runs on
both the Macintosh and Windows 95/98 platforms.
5 In a complete analysis of known and questioned documents, each document
would be analysed for the syntactic patterns of all major parts of speech.
