Abstract 
 
In this paper, we describe a set of experiments to 
examine the effect of various attributes of web genre on 
the automatic identification of the genre of web pages.  
Four different genres are used in the data set, namely, 
FAQ, News, E-Shopping and Personal Home Pages.  
The effects of the number of features used to represent 
the web pages (5, 20, or 100) as well as the types of 
attributes, <content, form, functionality>, singly and in 
various combinations are examined.     
 
The results indicate that fewer features produce 
better precision but more features produce better 
recall, and that attributes in combinations will always 
perform better than single attributes. 
 
 
1.  Introduction 
 
A genre is a, “classifying statement,” [15] and is 
characterized by having similar content and form 
where content refers to themes and topics and form 
refers to, “... observable physical and linguistic features 
...,” [25]. It allows us to recognize items that are 
similar even in the midst of great diversity. For 
instance, the detective novel is a particular genre and 
we are able to recognize novels as members of that 
genre as opposed to being of some other genre, even 
though the novels themselves may be very different.  
Once recognized as being of the same genre, we can 
then more easily compare the individual novels.  
 
As the World Wide Web continues to grow 
exponentially, researchers and search engine 
companies continue to look for techniques that will 
improve the quality of search results.  One method that 
has been suggested is to classify web pages by their 
type of genre and use this information to focus a search 
more narrowly or to rank search results [9, 16].  
Experiments by Dewdney et al. [3] have shown that the 
inclusion of genre information as part of the query can 
significantly improve precision, while suffering only a 
modest reduction in recall.  Another study [13] 
reported 64% of the students in the study regarded 
automated genre classification as potentially very 
useful for web search. 
 
However, the growth of the World Wide Web has 
been matched by a similar growth in the variety of 
genres found on the web [20].  This growth includes 
the replication of existing genres onto the web, the 
evolution of existing genres, and the spontaneous 
appearance of new genres [18].  This expanding and 
evolving set of web genres makes it difficult to identify 
automatically the genre of a web page, thus making it 
difficult to use in the improvement of the quality of 
search results.  Additionally, it is difficult to know the 
boundaries of a genre and to know when one has 
crossed from one genre into another genre [1] or when 
a web page represents the emergence of a new genre. 
 
The research reported in this paper examines the 
effectiveness of different types and combinations of 
genre attributes for the classification of web pages by 
genre.  It is one step in a larger research project that 
applies machine learning techniques to web page 
classification according to genre. The features 
normally used in genre identification represent the 
attributes by which genres are normally characterized, 
i.e., the tuple, <content, form>.  However, genres 
found on the web, cybergenres, may be characterized 
by the triple, <content, form, functionality>, where 
functionality is the functionality afforded by the web 
page [18].  In this model, features representing the 
content attribute may include terms extracted from the 
text, features representing the form attribute may 
include tables and graphics, and features representing 
the functionality attribute may include navigation links. 
It is the effectiveness of combinations of these three 
types of attributes for the identification of web genre 
that is reported in this paper.

2.  Growth of web genre 
 
Although “genre” has been long recognized as a 
classifying statement [15], the first research to examine 
the types of genres on the web was done fairly 
recently.  In 1997, Crowston and Williams [2] 
examined 100 web pages with the intention of looking 
for reproduced and emergent genres.  On the basis of 
form and purpose, they identified 48 different genres.  
Of the 100 sampled pages, they found that 80 of the 
pages more or less faithfully replicated the genres in 
the traditional media.  This is consistent with 
McLuhan’s [12] observation that, “The objectives of 
new media have tended, fatally, to be set in terms of 
the parameters and frames of the older media.”   
 
In 1998, Shepherd and Watters [18] classified 96 
randomly selected web sites on the basis of content, 
form and functionality.  They used a much coarser 
grained set of criteria and grouped the 96 sites into 5 
major categories consisting of:  home page, brochure, 
resource, catalogue and game.  This research did 
highlight the enormous change that took place on the 
web the between the studies. 
 
In 2001, Roussinov et al. [16] did a larger study of 
genre on the web with 184 users.  The web pages were 
tracked and the respondents were asked to report the 
purpose or task that they were performing when 
viewing that page.  There were 1234 web pages all 
together.  The interviewers coded the web pages with 
the addition of new genres as needed.  There were 116 
different genres identified.  The respondents were 
asked to assign their web pages to the appropriate 
genres.  Only 1076 web pages were successfully 
assigned to genre categories with agreement of only 
49.63% between the interviewers and the respondents.  
 
A number of researchers [9,17,20] have postulated 
that the reasons it appears to be so difficult to identify 
web genre is that it is like “hitting a moving target” 
[20], i.e., the web and web genre are evolving at a 
tremendous rate.   
 
These studies reveal three important issues; the 
number of web genres seems to be growing, existing 
web genre are evolving, and lastly, it is often difficult 
to determine the genre of a web page.  The research 
reported in this paper examines what attributes or 
combinations of attributes of <content, form, 
functionality> are most effective in identifying web 
genre automatically, and how many features of each 
genre attribute. 
 
3.  Automatic genre identification 
 
In order to apply a machine learning approach to 
the automatic identification of genres, a feature set 
must be selected that can be used to distinguish one 
genre from another and to properly assign a web page 
or document to a target genre class. The features 
normally used in genre identification represent the 
attributes by which genres are normally characterized, 
i.e., the tuple, <content, form>.  However, genres 
found on the web, cybergenres, may be characterized 
by the triple, <content, form, functionality>, where 
functionality is the functionality afforded by the web 
page [19], and the feature set should also represent the 
functionality attribute. 
 
The content attribute is normally represented by 
vectors of terms extracted from the text of the 
documents.  These may be extracted on a statistical 
basis or they may be extracted on a syntactic basis, 
such as extracting all noun phrases.  The form attribute 
may be represented by a number of different features 
including parts-of-speech, punctuation, number of 
images and positioning on the page.  Functionality may 
be represented by the presence of executable code 
found in the web page, such as javascript and applets. 
 
Stamatatos et al. [22] used discriminant analysis on 
the frequencies of commonly occurring terms and 
punctuation marks with modest success, whereas Lee 
and Myaeng [10] had better results using word 
statistics in sets of Korean and English web pages.  
 
Stamatatos et al. [23] used discriminant analysis on 
the features generated with SCBD, which is a Natural 
Language Processing (NPL) tool for unrestricted Greek 
text. They found that for the web replications of 
traditional Greek genres of their interest, discriminant 
analysis’s performance is slightly better than multiple 
regression and features generated through NPL 
outperforms the most frequent term method and 
vocabulary richness method. 
 
Karlgren and Cutting [7] used only form attributes 
such as parts-of-speech and had good results when the 
number of target genre categories was only two or 
four, but achieved only about fifty percent accuracy 
Proceedings of the 41st Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2008
2
when the number of target genre categories increased 
to fifteen.  Kessler et al. [8], also used only form 
attributes, such as parts-of speech counts, average 
sentence length, etc.  Georg Rehm [14], discusses a 
series of features for the classification of academic web 
pages as a genre. These features include such things as: 
use of logos or graphics of university/departments, 
alternate version for other languages, home page 
owners name, pictures or photos of author, contact 
information (address, phone/fax/e-mail, room number, 
office hours or secretary phone number).   
 
Lim et al. [11] et al. investigated the usefulness of a 
variety of feature sets using a data corpus of 16 genres 
from a collection of Korean Web pages. They found 
most useful features included the URL, HTML tags, 
token information, function words, punctuation marks 
and chunks. 
 
The literature seems to indicate that results are 
somewhat better when form and content features are 
used together.  Dewdney et al. [3] found that support 
vector machines performed equally well when using 
either content only or form only feature sets, but when 
the feature sets were combined, the results were 
significantly better.  Their results with a Naïve Bayes 
classifier showed that performance with a content-
based feature set was better than with a form-based 
feature set but, again, a combined feature set 
performed best.  Finn and Kushmerick [5,6] examined 
three feature sets; a bag of words, a part-of-speech 
vector of ratios of different parts of speech, and a 
vector of text statistics such as average sentence length 
and word length.  Again, they found that in most cases 
they had their best results when all three feature sets 
were used in combination. 
 
The reports of better results when content and form 
attributes are used in combination makes sense as web 
genres themselves are characterized by the <content, 
form, functionality> triple.  However, none of these 
studies included the features of the functionality 
attribute. One study [21] that did attempt to 
differentiate personal home pages from corporate and 
organizational home pages found that functionality 
played little effect, but the data set was fairly small.   
 
4. Data set 
 
A data corpus of 1280 web pages was created that 
included 170 instances of each of four genres, which 
are FAQ, News, E-Shopping, and Personal Home Page 
(PHP). The FAQ, E-Shopping, and News data sets 
were taken from the Santini genre collection.1  A set of 
170 Personal Home Pages were collected using the 
random Google feature at http://www.mangle.ca.  
These four genre types were selected as they appear to 
be quite different from each other.  Although using a 
larger number of genres would probably lower the 
classification results as presented in Section 6, we were 
not as interested in the results per se, but rather in the 
effects of various combinations of the content, form 
and functionality attributes and the number of 
representative features of each had on the ability to 
correctly identify a web genre. 
 
In addition, a random set of 600 noise web pages 
was also generated using http://www.mangle.ca. A 
noise page was a web page of any web genre that was 
not one of FAQ, News, E-Shopping, or Personal Home 
Page as agreed upon by the three raters.  Six hundred 
noise pages were considered sufficient as only 170 of 
the pages were selected randomly from this set for 
these experiments.  
 
All of the data sets were reviewed to ensure that 
there was 100% agreement on the genre of each item, 
among the three raters. In the case of the noise data set, 
the agreement was that none of the noise pages was an 
instance of Personal Home Page, E-Shopping, News or 
FAQ, i.e., the noise data set was pure noise. 
 
An open source HTML parser issued by 
SourceForge 2  was used and reprogrammed so that 
lexical information from each page was retrieved and 
organized in accordance with the needs of this project. 
During the parsing, the retrieved terms were stemmed 
using Porter’s algorithm3. No stop words were remove 
as all candidate features were selected by a feature 
selection measure. After parsing, the set of terms was 
reduced by eliminating terms that occurred only one 
time. Those terms are eliminated because: first, they 
might be misspelled terms; second, they occur too 
rarely to discriminate among genres; third, there are 
many of them so that they would affect performance of 
further data processing.

5.  Methodology 
 
Previously reported results of this research project 
[4] addressed the issues of classifiers, feature sizes and 
feature selection measures for this classification 
problem.  It found that in a binary classification 
scenario, the results using a Naïve Bayes classifier 
were as good as those obtained using a neural net 
classifier or a support vector machine.  It also found 
that the Information Gain [24] measure for feature 
selection was as good as the Chi Statistic for sizes of 
the features set, and superior to the Mutual Information 
measure in the case of a feature set of only 5 features.   
 
On this basis [4] the research reported in this paper 
is based on using the Naïve Bayes classifier and the 
Information Gain Measure for feature selection.  In 
addition, the results presented in this paper used the 
Multivariate Bernoulli Model form of the Naïve Bayes 
classifier as it significantly out performed the 
Multinomial Model. 
 
A classification architecture was created consisting 
of 4 two-way classification subsystems, as per [4].  
Each subsystem was trained to classify one of the 4 
genres:  Personal Home Page, FAQ, E-Shopping, and 
News.  
 
For each subsystem, a data set was prepared 
independently. It consisted of 170 web pages of the 
genre it was associated with as a genre category, and 
170 web pages from the randomly generated set of 
noise web pages. This set of 170 noise pages was then 
used in all further experiments reported in this paper. 
An independent feature selection procedure using the 
Information Gain measure was used on each data set, 
generating a separate feature space for each subsystem. 
 
 10-fold cross validation was used in the 
experiments, which means the data set in each 
subsystem is stratified and randomized in each run of 
the experiment, and 90% of the web pages in each 
category in a subsystem are used to form a training set 
on which the subsystem is trained independently. The 
remaining 10% of the web pages in the data set of each 
subsystem are used to form a test data set for all the 
subsystems, i.e. they will be run on each subsystem.  
 
The precision and recall are calculated based on a 
confusion matrix produced after all 10 runs are over, 
by taking a micro-average over all the results in each 
run. 
 
5.1.  Experiments 
 
The objectives of these experiments are to 
determine which attribute or combination of attributes 
drawn from the triple, <content, form, functionality> 
are required to correctly identify web page genre, and 
the effect of the number of representative features of 
each attribute.  
 
Typical features that would be associated with the 
content, form and functionality attributes are as 
follows: 
• Content 
o Text visible to the user via the web 
browser 
• Form 
o The name, attribute names and 
values of the HTML tags; title, Head, 
Font, Bullet, Div, Style, table, tr 
(table row), td (table data element) 
• Functionality 
o The name, attribute names and 
values of the HTML tags; Applet, 
Script, Jsp, Link, Form, Select, 
Option, Textarea, Input 
 
Table 1 shows typical features of the four web 
genres used in this research in terms of the content, 
form and functionality attributes. 
 
The features for each attribute type were selected 
on the basis of the Information Gain measure, as 
discussed above.  Extensive experimentation was done 
to determine an appropriate feature set size and the 
results reported here are for 5, 20 and 100 features.  
Beyond 100 features, the results slowly decreased 
while interesting results were obtained at 5, 20 and 100 
numbers of features.   The features selected were those 
with the highest Information Gain values [4].  
Experiments for 5, 20 and 100 features were run for 
each of the following 7 sets of attribute type 
combinations: 
• Content 
• Form 
• Functionality 
• Content and Form 
• Content and Functionality 
• Form and Functionality 
• Content, Form and Functionality

In each combination case, an equal number of 
features representing that particular attribute were 
used.  For instance, when Content was the sole 
attribute investigated, the top 5, 20 and 100 content 
features were selected for the three sets of feature 
sizes.  However, when the combination of Content, 
Form and Functionality was investigated, the top 5, 20 
and 100 features from each of the types of attributes 
were selected giving total feature sets of 15, 60 and 
300, respectively. 
 
6.  Results 
 
The results of the experiments are presented in 
Tables A1 through A5 in the Appendix.  An analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) was performed to determine the 
effect on precision and recall of the type of genre, the 
type of attribute and combination of these attributes, 
and the number of features representing these attribute 
types.  A summary of the results and the results of the 
ANOVA follow. 
 
6.1.  Effect of genre 
 
Table 2 has the summarized results for precision 
and recall for the effect of the type of genre.  The cell 
values are the means with the standard deviations in 
parentheses.  These results indicate that it is possible to 
differentiate successfully among different types of 
genre. 
Table 2.  Mean precision and recall for genre. 
Standard deviations in parenthesis. 
 
Genre Precision Recall 
E-Shopping 0.920 (0.075) 0.902 (0.073) 
FAQ 0.992 (0.023) 0.894 (0.088) 
News 0.978 (0.930) 0.987 (0.018) 
PHP 0.863 (0.073) 0.939 (0.048) 
 
The effect on precision of the type of genre was 
significant at p<0.001.  The partial Eta squared4 was 
0.663.  The partial Eta squared is the proportion of 
total variability attributable to a factor, in this case the 
type of genre.  The ANOVA results indicated that 
means were significantly different and the effect size 
of genre type was large.  The partial Eta squared was 
0.663, which means that genre type itself accounted for 
66.3% of the overall (effect+error) variance.  The 
precision for the FAQ genre was significantly better 
than for the News genre, which was significantly better 
than for the E-Shopping genre,  which was 
significantly better than for the Personal Home Page 
genre, at p=0.05. 
 
The effect on recall of the type of genre was 
significant at p<0.001.  The partial Eta squared was

0.442, indicating that genre type was an important 
factor for recall, accounting for 44.2% of the overall 
variance.  The recall for the NEWS genre was 
significantly better than for the Personal Home Page 
genre, which was significantly better than for the E-
Shopping or FAQ genre, at p=0.05.  There was no 
significant difference in recall levels between the E-
Shopping and FAQ genres. 
 
6.2.  Effect of attributes 
 
Table 3 has the summarized results for precision 
and recall for the effect of the different types of 
attributes and combinations of those types. These 
results indicate that combinations of types of attributes 
are generally better than using only one attribute, such 
as content. 
 
Table 3.  Mean precision and recall for 
attribute type. Standard deviations in 
parenthesis. 
 
Attribute Precision Recall 
Content  0.905 (0.110) 0.838 (0.172) 
Form  0.928 (0.084) 0.926 (0.078) 
Functionality 0.938 (0.063) 0.944 (0.065) 
Content &

Content & 
Form & 
Functionality 
0.952 (0.058) 0.965 (0.043) 
 
The effect on precision of which attributes or 
combinations of attributes used was significant at 
p<0.001.  The partial Eta squared was 0.158, indicating 
that the contribution of combinations of attributes to 
the variability was modest, accounting for 15.8% of the 
overall variance.  The effect of functionality and of 
form were significantly better than for content alone 
(0.905), at p=0.05, but no significant difference 
between them.  However, the combinations of 
<content, form, functionality>, <form, functionality> 
and <content, functionality> were all significantly 
better at p=0.05 than either form or functionality alone, 
but there were no significant differences among these 
combinations.  The <content, form> combination was 
not significantly different than functionality alone, at 
p=0.05. 
 
The effect on recall of which attributes or 
combinations of attributes used was significant at 
p<0.001.  The partial Eta squared was 0.470 indicating 
that the effect of combinations of the attributes to the 
variability was large, accounting for 47% of the overall 
variance.  Of the single attributes, functionality had 
significantly better recall than did the form attribute, 
which had significantly better recall than did the 
content attribute, at p=0.05.  The combinations of 
<content, form, functionality> and <form, 
functionality> were both significantly better than the 
attributes used alone, at p=0.05, but not significantly 
different from each other.  The <content, form> 
combination is between the single attributes of form 
and functionality. 
 
6.3.  Effect of number of features 
 
Table 4 has the summarized results for precision 
and recall for the effect of the number of features. The 
results indicate that the number of features of each 
attribute is important and that fewer features may be 
better than more features. 
 
Table 4.  Mean precision and recall for number 
of features. Standard deviations in

100 0.929 (0.081) 0.938 (0.075) 
 
The effect on precision of the number of features 
used was significant at p<0.001.  Although the means 
were significantly different, the effect of the number of 
features was small to modest.  The partial Eta squared 
was just 0.033, which means that the number of 
features by itself accounted for only 3.3% of the 
overall (effect+error) variance. The precision for 
features sets of size 5 and 20 were significantly better 
than for size 100, at p=0.05. 
 
Proceedings of the 41st Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences - 2008

The effect on recall of the number of features used 
was significant at p<0.001.  The partial Eta squared 
was 0.149, indicating that the number of features had a 
modest effect, accounting for 14.9% of the overall 
variance.  The recall for the features set of size 100  
was significantly better than either size 5 or 20, at 
p=0.05.  The difference in recall for feature sets of size 
5 and 20 were not significant at p=0.05. 
 
7.  Summary 
 
This examination of the effect on the automatic 
classification of web pages by genre has shown that the 
type of genre, the type of attributes and combination of 
those attributes, and the number of features 
representing each type of attribute used have 
significant effects on the effectiveness of the 
classification, measured in terms of precision and 
recall. 
 
Although we cannot generalize for both recall and 
precision, we can generalize for either recall or for 
precision.  The type of genre significantly affects the 
recall and the precision.  A smaller feature set is more 
effective in increasing precision than it is in increasing 
recall, while a larger feature set is more effective in 
increasing recall. 
 
In examining the results for the types of attributes 
and combinations of attributes, combinations of 
attributes improve both recall and precision, and the 
functionality attribute appears to be important in the 
combinations. 
 
This research is continuing and experimentation is 
ongoing with respect to the effect of noise and the 
combinations of known genres and the identification of 
web pages that may belong to multiple genres.
