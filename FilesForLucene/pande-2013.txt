Mathematical Modelling of the Pattern of Occurrence of
Words in Different Corpora of the Hindi Language⁄

ABSTRACT
The incidence of different components of language in natural language texts are not arbi-
trarily organized but tend to obey particular laws which enable us to explain characteristic
features of human language. The present paper is an attempt to analyse and model the pat-
tern of occurrence of words in the Hindi language. Various kinds of corpora have been
selected from different sources for the study, and the occurrence of words in these corpora
has been observed for a variety of properties such as: frequencies, vocabulary measures, and
pattern of initials of words relative to the subsequent matra.
1. INTRODUCTION
The multitude of linguistic utterances around us in the form of conversation,
writing and other media can be placed into a theoretical framework that
both describes linguistic usage and also predicts the patterns of occurrence
of various linguistic features. Bharati et al. (2002) have presented statistical
analyses based on measures like unigram frequencies, bigram frequencies,
syllable frequencies and so on of 10 machine-readable Indian language cor-
pora. In the context of analysis and modelling for the Hindi language, we
also cite the work of Jayaram and Vidya (2006) for discussion of word
length frequency distribution in Hindi and some other Indian languages.
Jayaram and Vidya (2008) have utilized Zipf’s law for the word frequency
distribution of Hindi and three other Indian languages. In earlier work we

(Pande & Dhami, 2010) have analysed and modelled the pattern of occur-
rence of various letters in Hindi texts and in initial position of the words of
those texts.
Murthy and Kumar (2006) have noted that Devanagari script is used to
write various languages such as Sanskrit, Hindi, Marathi, Konkani and
Sindhi, and that mere script identification does not serve the purpose of
being “able to identify language irrespective of the script or font being
used”. Pingali and Varma (2007) have observed that “script based recogni-
tion for Unicode character sets works to an extent, but still ambiguities
might exist”, and give examples which show that for some of the Indian
languages written in the Devanagari the script-based heuristics may not
work. In their opinion a better set of heuristics is required and they have
conjectured that statistical language identification techniques can help for
ambiguous scripts. Sanderson (2007) has pointed out the importance of the
easily determinable characteristic “distribution of letters in a text” in the
process of language determination.
In the present paper we discuss the following features associated with
the component “word”: word frequency distribution, vocabulary measures,
pattern of occurrence of words and the entropy measure of different corpora
of the Hindi language. The models for distributions of words in corpora are
discussed in Section 3, and Section 4 deals with the comparison of various
vocabulary-richness measures. In Section 5 we examine the pattern of
occurrence of words in various corpora and determine the entropy of the
selected corpora. A comparison of the entropies of the various corpora is
also given in this section.
2. DATA SOURCES AND THE DATA FOR THE PRESENT STUDY
We have counted the frequencies of words in the corpus Tanav se Mukti
and in five other corpora obtained from various sources1:
(1) Corpus Tanav se Mukti by the author Shivanand (C1).
(2) Corpus formed by composition of five stories (C2).
(3) Corpus containing 29 short stories (C3).
(4) Corpus containing 62 articles (C4).
(5) Corpus containing 37 articles (C5).
(6) Poetic Corpus containing 180 poems (C6).

We have determined the rank frequency data, number of word tokens
and word types (different words used in the corpus, or the vocabulary of
the corpus) and number of words occurring once, twice, thrice and so on.
Data for the words starting with vowels and with consonants without any
matra, a Hindi word which designates the vowel mark following the conso-
nant, and with the consonants followed by different matras has also been
derived. We have assigned the ranks to the words in accordance to their
descending order of frequencies as is done by the Zipf distribution after
obtaining the word frequency statistics.
3. WORD FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION
In our earlier work (Pande & Dhami, 2010) we discussed various models
such as the Zipf, Zipf Mandelbrot, Good, geometric series, Yule, and nega-
tive hypergeometric distributions together with the Borodovsky and Gusein
Zad and Eftekhari (2006) equations. All these models have been used by
researchers to determine frequencies from ranks for different language com-
ponents. These models (excluding the first two) are used for letters, graph-
eme and phoneme frequencies of language. The parameter-free models, the
model of Good and the Borodovsky and Gusein Zad equation as well as
the parametric equations of Eftekhari and negative hypergeometric distribu-
tion depend on the highest rank for the data. These do not give good results
in cases where the value of the highest rank is large, as in the present case
of frequency distribution of words.
We have applied the distributions of Zipf, Zipf Mandelbrot, geometric-
series and of Yule to the frequencies and ranks of words for the above-cited
Hindi corpora.
Zipf’s law (Zipf, 1949) has been defined in the work of Manning and
Schütze (1999) as a relation between the frequency of occurrence of an
event and its rank when the events are ranked with respect to the frequency
of occurrence (the most frequent one first). According to this law ‘if the fre-
quency of occurrence of an event is ranked in descending order of
frequency, then
Fr / 1r;Frr ¼ c;
where Fr is the frequency of event of rth rank and c is a constant’. The
general form of this formula was given by him in later works as:

where a and b are text parameters.
A modification to the Zipf formula was introduced by Mandelbrot (Man-
delbrot, 1966), as cited in Manning and Schütze (1999), by including an addi-
tional parameter c in the following formula of rank frequency distribution:
Fr ¼ aðr þ cÞb ð2Þ
where a, b and c are parameters.
Geometric series equation. General form of the geometric series
equation is given by:
Fr ¼ abr: ð3Þ
The equation for the Yule distribution is:
Fr ¼ arb c
r; ð4Þ
where a, b, c are parameters.
For the determination of the parameters we have used the datafit soft-
ware. We have calculated the theoretical values of the frequencies corre-
sponding to above four distributions and the values of determination
coefficient (R2) for these models by the formula
R2 ¼ 1 SSerr
SStot

where the data set has n observed values yi, i = 1, 2, …, n each of which
has an associated modelled value fi and y is the mean of the observed data.

error (or the residual sum of squares).

R2 is a statistic that gives information about the goodness of fit of a
model for linear models. We have made an attempt to extend its domain to
non-linear models which has resulted the investigation of results in the pres-
ent work. However, in the case of non-linear models the value of above

definition of R2 may be outside the interval [0, 1]. We have also compared
the values of the squared correlation R1
2 (pseudo-R2) between the observed
values yi and modelled values fi of the frequencies. For the comparison of
models for various corpora we have applied the models for the relative
frequencies of various words. The values of R2 and R1
2 for the studied
corpora are greatest corresponding to the Zipf Mandelbrot law. For the
corpus C1, the values of the R2 and R1
2 are shown in Table 1.
The calculated values of the determination coefficients for the Zipf
Mandelbrot distribution are shown in Figure 1.
The figure demonstrates that the values of the determination coefficient
are very close to 1 for all the corpora. Similarly the values of the squared
correlation between predicted and observed frequencies for these are in the
range 0.9742–0.9965. Therefore Zipf Mandelbrot law has been taken as
the model for the rank frequency distribution of words in Hindi corpora.
The values of parameters a, c, and b for this model for various corpora are
given in Table 2.
Since Table 2 shows that the values of the parameter b are very close to
1, we have tested the same, that is, the Zipf Mandelbrot distribution, by

2 for the corpus C1 for different models.

taking b = 1. This has resulted in the reduction of one parameter from the
equation and thus the distribution takes the form:
Fr ¼ aðr þ cÞ1 ¼
1
ðpþ qrÞ1 ¼
1
ðpþ qrÞ;
where p and q are parameters.
We have applied this model for the rank frequency data of the various
corpora. The calculated values of the determination coefficient correspond-
ing to this model are listed in Table 3. In the present case the values of the
squared correlation between predicted and observed frequencies are in the
range 0.9739–0.9962.
Results of the determination coefficient in Table 3 are very close to 1,
and the values in the case of this model are greater than the corresponding
values determined for other models, discussed earlier. Thus we can con-
clude that when only two parameters are considered the model for the rank
frequency distribution of words for the Hindi language corpora should be

4. VOCABULARY RICHNESS MEASURES
Panas (2007) pointed out that “the index of lexical richness is a fundamen-
tal parameter describing the word frequency structure of a text”, and noted
that Wimmer and Altmann (1999), in a review article on vocabulary rich-
ness, discussed four different approaches to study the indices of vocabulary
richness:
• by measuring the indices,
• by curve representation,
• by empirical and theoretical distributions,
• by stochastic processes.
We have used the five vocabulary richness measures propounded by Yule,
Honore, Brunet, Sichel, and Simpson as cited in the research paper of
Stamatatos et al. (2000). These measures are given in the following form
K ¼ 10

where V is the vocabulary of a text or corpus, N is the total number of word
tokens in the text, V1 (called hapax legomena) and V2 (hapax dislegomena)
are the number of words occurring once and twice respectively in the text
and Vi is the number of words occurring exactly i times. Calculated values
of Brunet measure  102 and of Sichel measure, Yule measure  102,
Honore measure  103, Simpson measure  102 are shown in Figure 2.
These two figures show that the values of Yule’s measure and Simpson’s
measure are lower for C6, which is the corpus formed by the composition
of poems. For C1, C4 and C5 the values of these measures are relatively
higher. These corpora are generated from the non-story type text(s): corpus
C1 is Tanav se Mukti written by Shivanand, C2 is the corpus formed by the

composition of the 62 articles from the Sampadakeey and corpus C3 is the
compendium of 37 articles from the Nazaria section of the Navbharat
Times. For the corpora C2 and C3 the values of these measures are higher
than the values for the corpus C6 and lower than the values for the C1, C4
and C5. C2 is collection of short stories and C3 is a composition of five
stories. Thus it can be concluded that, for the poetic corpus, the values of
the measures of Yule and Simpson are lower, for stories these are higher
than the corresponding values for the poetic corpus and much higher for the
corpora of the Lekh (essay) kind. The value of the Brunet vocabulary mea-
sure for all the corpora is nearly equal (in the range from 0.1 to 0.12) and
for the corpus C6, it is relatively lower than the value for others (C1-C5).
Thus it can be concluded that the verse corpus has a relatively lower Brunet
measure than that of non-verse cases.
5. PATTERN AND ENTROPY OF WORDS WITH DIFFERENT
INITIALS
The pattern of initials of words in corpora was analysed for the proportion
of words initiated with vowels and with consonants. Obtained values of the
proportions have been shown in the Table 4.
The table shows that, except in C6, which is the collection of poems, in
all the considered corpora 85% to 87% of words start with the consonants
and 13% to 15% with vowels. In C6 these percentages are close to 90%
and 10% respectively. Thus it can be said that in non-verse Hindi language
corpora 85% to 87% of words start with consonants and in case of verse
more words start with consonants than in non-verse corpora.

The entropy or degree of uncertainty of the distribution of a random var-
iable x is computed as determined in our earlier work, Pande and Dhami
(2010), by the formula:
HðxÞ ¼ 
X
x2X
pðxÞ log2ðxÞ: ð9Þ
p(x) represents the probability of x. Each consonant in a text can have three
types of instances as a consonant, as a half consonant (or consonant fol-
lowed by a halant “ ◌्”) and as a consonant followed by any matra (◌ा/◌ॉ,
ि◌, ◌ी, ◌ु, ◌ ू, ◌ृ, ◌ े, ◌ै, ◌ो, ◌ौ, ◌ं, ◌ः). Thus each consonant can occur in 14
different ways in text, where the occurrences of क in का,ं काँ (क + ◌ा + ◌ ं,
क + ◌ा + ◌ँ) etc. have been interpreted as occurrence of क followed by
matra “◌ा”. Results of frequencies of consonants with different matra for
the example text (C1) are shown in Table 5.
After calculating the data for different corpora we have determined the
values of the entropy for various corpora with the help of Equation (9), and
these are shown in Table 6.

The table shows that the values of the entropy for all the considered
corpora, whether these are verse or non verse, is nearly 3.1 and is in the
range from 3.05 to 3.15.
6. CONCLUSION
We can conclude that
• The model for governing the rank frequency distribution in Hindi
language corpora is the law of Zipf Mandelbrot:
Fr ¼ aðr þ cÞb;
where a, b, c are parameters and Fr is the frequency of word of rank r.
 In the case of only two parameters, the appropriate model can be
expressed as:
Fr ¼ 1pþ qr;
where p and q are parameters.
 For the poetic corpus the values of the measures of Yule and Simpson
are lower, for stories these are higher than the corresponding values
for poetic corpus and for the corpus of Lekh (essay) type these values
are much higher. The verse corpus has relatively lower Brunet measure
than that of non-verse case.
 Out of all the words in prose corpora 85–87% words initiate with the
consonants. In the case of verse this proportion of words on average is
larger than the non-verse case.

 The entropy for the pattern of the consonants occurring in the initial
position of words of the corpora is within the specific range 3.05–
3.15, which gives an important and easily determinable property of
Hindi corpora. This fact can be used for the language identification
task to discriminate Hindi language from some other languages written
in the Devanagari script.
