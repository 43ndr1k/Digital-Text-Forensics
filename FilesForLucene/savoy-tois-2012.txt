Authorship Attribution Based on Specific Vocabulary
JACQUES SAVOY, University of Neuchatel
In this article we propose a technique for computing a standardized Z score capable of defining the specific
vocabulary found in a text (or part thereof) compared to that of an entire corpus. Assuming that the term
occurrence follows a binomial distribution, this method is then applied to weight terms (words and punc-
tuation symbols in the current study), representing the lexical specificity of the underlying text. In a final
stage, to define an author profile we suggest averaging these text representations and then applying them
along with a distance measure to derive a simple and efficient authorship attribution scheme. To evaluate
this algorithm and demonstrate its effectiveness, we develop two experiments, the first based on 5,408
newspaper articles (Glasgow Herald) written in English by 20 distinct authors and the second on 4,326
newspaper articles (La Stampa) written in Italian by 20 distinct authors. These experiments demonstrate
that the suggested classification scheme tends to perform better than the Delta rule method based on the
most frequent words, better than the chi-square distance based on word profiles and punctuation marks,
better than the KLD scheme based on a predefined set of words, and better than the naı̈ve Bayes approach.

1. INTRODUCTION
Given the extensive amount of textual information now freely available and recent
progress made in Natural Language Processing (NLP) [Manning and Schütze 2000],
a variety of text categorization tasks and successful solutions have been put forward
[Sebastiani 2002; Weiss et al. 2010]. In this study, we consider authorship attribution
[Craig and Kinney 2009; Juola 2006; Love 2002] whereby the author of a given text
must be determined based on text samples written by known authors. More precisely,
we focus on the closed-class attribution method in which the real author is one of
several possible candidates. Other pertinent concerns related to this issue include the
mining of demographic or psychological information on an author (profiling) [Argamon
et al. 2009] or simply determining whether or not a given author did in fact write
a given Internet message (chat, email, Wikipedia article) or document (verification)
[Koppel et al. 2009].

The initial requirement in these categorization problems is to represent the texts by
means of numerical vectors comprising relevant features helpful in assigning them to
various authors or categories. This process requires the ongoing extraction and selec-
tion of such features [Yang and Pedersen 1997], especially those more useful in iden-
tifying differences between the authors’ writing styles (authorship attribution). More
generally we need to seek out differences between topics or categories (e.g., politics,
finance, macro-economics, sports) [Finn and Kushmerick 2005; Sebastiani 2002] or
between genres (surveys, editorials, research papers, blog, homepages, etc.) [Argamon
2006; Stamatatos et al. 2001]. In a second stage we weight the selected features accord-
ing to their discriminative power as well as their importance in the underlying textual
representation. Finally, through applying classification rules or learning schemes
[Bishop 2007; Hastie et al. 2009; Witten and Franck 2005], the system assigns the
most appropriate author (or category) to a given input text (single-label categorization
problem).
To achieve this objective we propose and evaluate a simple new method for select-
ing and weighting terms (e.g., n-gram of characters, word types, lemmas, n-gram of
words, noun or verb phrases, Parts-Of-Speech (POS) sequences, etc.) and representing
the documents and author styles involved. Our approach mainly relies on differences
found between expected and observed term occurrence frequencies within two disjoint
subsets. Based on a standardized Z score, we then define overused terms in one subset
(defined as its specific vocabulary), terms common to both subsets (common vocabu-
lary), and finally underused terms. In our opinion, a simple categorization rule capable
of providing reasonable performance levels is preferable to a more complex approach
(lex parcimoniae or Occam’s razor principle [Bishop 2007]). Although it might not al-
ways be the best solution it would at least guarantee a practical system (a single-rule
method was suggested and successfully applied in the data mining field [Holte 1993]).
Moreover in our opinion, for a given corpus there is limited interest in obtaining better
performance levels simply by adjusting various parameter settings without any solid
theoretical foundation. Such a practice may lead to overfitting the model to the avail-
able data [Bishop 2007; Hastie et al. 2009] on the one hand, and on the other based on
past experiments, the appropriate value for a new collection or context cannot usually
be determined with the required precision. Finally, rather than relying on a black-box
method we believe it is important that resulting decisions be clearly explained.
The rest of this article is divided as follows. Section 2 presents related works, while
Section 3 depicts the main characteristics of the corpora used in our experiments.
Section 4 briefly describes three classical author attribution approaches: the Delta
method [Burrows 2002], the χ2 statistic [Grieve 2007], and KLD [Zhao and Zobel
2007a, 2007b] to which our suggested scheme will be compared. This section exposes
the naı̈ve Bayes method [Mitchell 1997], a well-known approach in the machine
learning domain. Finally, this section also describes and evaluates our proposed
authorship attribution approach based on the Z score method. Section 5 summarizes
our main findings and identifies future perspectives.
2. RELATED WORK
Authorship attribution has a long-standing history and recently various noteworthy
literature surveys have been published [Juola 2006; Koppel et al. 2009; Love 2002;
Stamatatos 2009; Zheng et al. 2006]. As a first paradigm to solve the authorship
attribution problem, various approaches based on unitary invariant values have
been proposed [Holmes 1998]. These invariant measures must reflect the particular
style of a given author, but they should vary from one to another. Previous studies
involving this strategy suggested the use of lexical richness or word distribution
factors, including average word length and mean sentence length, as well as Yule’s
ACM Transactions on Information Systems, Vol. 30, No. 2, Article 12, Publication date: May 2012.
Authorship Attribution Based on Specific Vocabulary 12:3
K measure [Miranda-Garcia and Calle-Martin 2005] and statistics on type-token
ratios (e.g., Herdan’s C, Guiraud’s R or Honoré’s H), as well as the proportion of
word types occurring once or twice (e.g., [Sichel 1975]), or even the slope of Zipf ’s
empirical distribution [Baayen 2001, 2008, Section 6.5; Tuldava 2004]. To these we
could also add a few simple statistics such as letter occurrence frequencies [Ledger
and Merriam 1994], mean number of syllables per word, number of hapax legomena
(words occurring once) and their relative positions in a sentence [Morton 1986], etc. As
other possible sources of evidence, we might consider the vocabulary size attributed
to a given author [Efron and Thisted 1976; Thisted and Efron 1987]. None of these
measures has proved very satisfactory, however [Hoover 2003], due in part to word
distributions (including word bigrams or trigrams) ruled by a large number of very
low probability elements (Large Number of Rare Events or LNRE) [Baayen 2001].
In a second stage, instead of limiting ourselves to a single value we could ap-
ply a multivariate analysis to capture each author’s discriminative stylistic features
[Holmes 1992; Holmes and Crofts 2010; Holmes and Forsyth 1995]. Some of the main
approaches applicable here are Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [Binonga and
Smith 1999; Burrows 1992; Craig and Kinney 2009], cluster analysis [Labbé 2007],
and discriminant analysis [Jockers and Witten 2010; Ledger and Merriam 1994]. In
this case we represent documents (with known authors) as points within a given space,
and to determine who might be the author of a new text excerpt we simply search the
closest document [Hoover 2006], where the author of this nearest document would
probably be the author of the disputed text. For these cluster-based approaches to be
effective, however, the distance measure definition is of prime importance, and with
this in mind various metrics are suggested. We might, for example, mention stan-
dardized word-count frequency values [Binonga and Smith 1999] as well as the more
sophisticated intertextual distance [Labbé 2007], where the distance between two doc-
uments depends on both their shared vocabulary and occurrence frequencies. Yang
et al. [2003] proposed a similar approach where the distance between two texts is
based on the weighted sum of the rank order-frequency differences of word types oc-
curring in both texts. This distance measure tends to group the documents into several
classes, with each reflecting a distinct style or author.
Other recent studies pay more attention to various categories of topic-independent
features that may more closely reflect an author’s style, and in this perspective we
can identify three main sources. First, at the lexical level are word occurrence
frequency (or character n-grams), hapax legomena, average word length, letter occur-
rence frequency [Merriam 1998], and punctuation frequency, along with several other
representational marks. Special attention has also been given to function words (e.g.,
determiners (e.g., the, an), prepositions (in, of ), conjunctions (and), pronouns (I, he),
and certain auxiliary verbal forms (is, was, should)), features which appear in numer-
ous authorship attribution studies [Burrows 2002]. Certain authors have suggested
a wide variety of lists, although the precise definition of these function word lists is
questionable. Burrows [2002], for example, lists the top n most frequent word types
(with n = 40 to 150), Holmes and Forsyth [1995] 49 high-frequency words, Baayen and
Halteren [2002] a list of 50 words, while Jockers et al. [2008, p. 491] suggest 110 en-
tries, while the list compiled by Zhao and Zobel [2005] contains 363 words. Finally,
Hoover [2006] put forward a list of more than 1000 frequently occurring words, includ-
ing both function words (determiners, prepositions, conjunctions, pronouns, auxiliary
verbs) and lexical words (nouns, adjectives, verbs, adverbs). The interjection category
(e.g., oh, ah) as well as other-than-manner adverbs might also be added to the func-
tional word class [Miranda Garcia and Calle Martin 2007].
Not all studies, however, suggest limiting the possible stylistic features to a reduced
set of functional words or very frequent word types. In their study of the 85 Federalist

12:4 J. Savoy
Papers for example, Jockers and Witten [2010] derive 2907 words appearing at least
once in texts written by all three possible authors. From this word list, the researchers
could extract a reduced set composed of 298 words, after imposing the condition that
for each item the relative frequency must be greater than 0.05%.
Secondly, at the syntactic level we could account for Part-Of-Speech (POS) infor-
mation through measuring their distribution, frequency, patterns, or various com-
binations. Thirdly, some studies suggest considering structural and layout features
including the total number of lines, number of lines per sentence or per paragraph,
paragraph indentation, number of tokens per paragraph, presence of greetings or par-
ticular signature formats, as well as features derived from HTML tags. Additional fea-
tures considered could be particular orthographic conventions (e.g., British versus U.S.
spelling) or the occurrence of certain specific spelling errors, and the resulting number
of potential features considered could thus be rather large. Zheng et al. [2006], for
example, compiled a list of 270 possible features.
After selecting the most appropriate characteristics for a given document, we then
need a classification scheme capable of distinguishing between its various possible
authors. Related to this is the problem involving identifying the authors of short on-
line messages for which Zheng et al. [2006] suggest employing decision trees, back-
propagation neural networks, and Support Vector Machines (SVM). Based on corpora
written in English or Chinese, these experiments analyze various lexical, syntactic,
structural, as well as other content-specific features. For English descriptions that are
only based on lexical features result in performance levels similar to POS and lexical
feature combinations. This finding is confirmed by another recent study [Zhao and
Zobel 2007b]. Zheng et al. [2006] also find that SVM and neural networks tend to per-
formance levels significantly better than those achieved by decision trees. Zhao and
Zobel [2005], on the other hand, find that when defining the authorship of newspapers
articles the Nearest-Neighbor (NN or k-NN) approach tends to produce better effec-
tiveness than both the naı̈ve Bayes or decision-tree approaches (five possible authors,
300 training documents per author).
Instead of applying a general-purpose classification method, Burrows [2002] designs
a more specific Delta classifier based on the “mean of the absolute difference between
the z-scores for a set of word-variables in a given text-group, as well as the z-scores for
the same set of word-variables in a target-group”. This method was originally based
on the 150 most frequently occurring word tokens while Hoover [2004b] suggested this
scheme could be improved by considering the top 800 most frequent words. A few Delta
method variants have also been put forward [Hoover 2004a, 2007], as well as various
other interpretations of this same scheme [Argamon 2008; Stein and Argamon 2006].
In all cases the underlying assumption is that a given author’s style is best reflected
by identifying the use of function words (or by very frequent words) together with
their occurrence frequencies, rather than relying on a single vocabulary measure or
more topic-oriented terms. Recently, Jockers and Witten [2010] showed that the Delta
method could surpass performance levels achieved by the SVM method. In a related
study Kešelj et al. [2003] propose summing the normalized differences of occurrence
frequencies, which based on their results and performance levels, proved to be fairly
effective methods. To capture the individual style nuances of each author under con-
sideration, these same researchers also suggest applying n-gram characters instead of
words.
In summary, it seems reasonable to suggest that we make use of vocabulary fea-
tures, thus allowing us to conclude not only the presence or absence of words but also
their occurrence frequencies, allowing us to reveal the underlying and unknown “fin-
gerprint” of a given author during a specified period and relative to a particular genre
and topic. It is known, however, that word frequencies tend to change over time and

use [Hoover 2006], as do genres or forms (e.g., poetry or romance, drama or comedy,
prose or verse) [Burrows 2002; Hoover 2004b; Labbé 2007].
3. EVALUATION
Unlike the information retrieval domain [Manning et al. 2008], the authorship
attribution domain does not benefit from a relatively large number of publicly
available corpora. As such, making sufficiently precise comparisons between reported
performances and general trends regarding the relative merits of various feature
selections, weighting schemes, and classification approaches is problematic. Moreover,
so that verification and comparison can be done by others, the test collections used
to evaluate a proposed scheme must be stable and publicly available. Finally, we are
convinced that absolute performance levels cannot be directly compared across the
various evaluation studies. As such, only relative rankings between different tested
schemes could be reliably utilized, rather than direct comparisons between absolute
performance levels obtained from distinct corpora. When employing the same corpus,
however, it is not always fully clear how the various processing methods should be
implemented (e.g., tokenization, normalization of uppercase letters, etc.).
Another main concern is the size of the available test collection. In various previous
studies, the number of disputed texts and the number of possible authors are rather
limited. With the well-known Federalist Papers, for example, we tackled 85 texts from
which 12 are disputed articles written mainly by two possible authors (binary or two-
case classification) [Holmes and Forsyth 1995; Jockers and Witten 2010; Mosteller and
Wallace 1964]. Various binary classification problems related to Shakespeare’s works
are discussed in Craig and Kinney [2009], while in Burrows [1992] various experi-
ments are performed on six texts having two possible authors. Moreover, various in-
deep studies focus on a single text (book, play, diary) by two or three authors [Holmes
and Crofts 2010; Hoover and Hess 2009; Jockers et al. 2008; Ledger and Merriam
1994]. Other studies are, however, based on literary texts where the number of pos-
sible authors is greater than three, such as experiments described in Labbé [2007],
which focus on 52 text excerpts written by possibly nine distinct authors.
3.1. Corpus Evaluation
To handle these problems and in the interest of promoting test beds comprising more
authors and documents, we may consider using literary works available through
dedicated Web sites such as the Gutenberg project (see www.gutenberg.org). The
number of possible documents is, however, limited, due to the fact that not all works
are available and certain recent works are still under copyright. Along this same vein,
Zhao and Zobel [2007a] were able to download 634 books written by 55 authors mainly
covering English literature. To include comparable styles from different authors, we
must, however, consider texts of the same or similar genres, written during the same
period. Mixing Twain’s works with Shakespeare’s plays or even translations from
Schiller’s works, for example, does not produce a very useful corpus.
An alternative might be downloading Wikipedia articles, although such a corpus
would not be stable. At any time and without warning, a given text could be more or
less heavily edited, and even worse fully disappear, replaced by another, or written by
another person. Moreover, in working with such freely available material, we would
have to contend with greater variability in writing quality, expressions, and language
registers employed. More variability should also be expected with respect to authors
and their own backgrounds, given they could originate from very different cultures,
a phenomenon that renders the resulting test collection less challenging and less
pertinent.

12:6 J. Savoy
To build a large and useful test collection, we could employ a corpus of newspaper
articles. In this vein, Grieve [2007] downloaded articles from the London Telegraph
Web site (published from April 2001 to January 2005). The resulting corpus contained
works by 40 authors, each having 40 columns (1600 documents in total). In this case,
the precise selection of each document is not specified and free access to this corpus is
not guaranteed. Zhao and Zobel [2007b] used a similar strategy by considering articles
made available by newswire services (Associated Press), comprising about 200,000 ar-
ticles written by around 2380 authors. These newswire articles usually contain very
short documents in which the authors may simply describe an event (or simply trans-
late it) without adding any personal comments reflecting their own style. In the end,
having a large number of authors is not always the most pertinent approach. It is
known, for example, that in the event of disputed texts, the number of possible au-
thors is usually limited, with only 10 to 20 possible writers covering a large majority
of problematic cases, at least in terms of literary analysis. Moreover, in the analysis of
political speeches when searching for the name of the actual speechwriter behind each
discourse (such as T. Sorensen writing for President Kennedy [Carpenter and Seltzer
1970]), the number of possible authors is also limited, and certainly under the limit
of 20. Even when the number of possible writers is limited, the fact that they share a
common culture and education could render the task more difficult, as, for example, in
the case of Goldsmith, Kelly, and Murphy and their common Anglo-Irish roots [Dixon
and Mannion 1993].
In order to obtain a replicable test collection containing authors sharing a common
culture and having similar language registers, we opt for a stable and publicly avail-
able corpus by pulling out a subset of the CLEF 2003 test suite1 [Peters et al. 2004].
More precisely, we extract articles published in the Glasgow Herald (GH) during 1995,
a subset comprising 56,472 documents, of which 28,687 included the name of the au-
thor(s). Knowing that an article could be written by two or more authors, or that
an author could contribute to only a few texts, we could not simply decide to use all
these articles. In order to form a suitable test collection, we thus chose 20 authors
(see Table I), either as well-known columnists (names in italics) or having published
numerous papers in 1995. This selection process yields a set of 5,408 articles.
As shown in Table I, the Glasgow Herald (GH) corpus covers different subjects and
a clear overlap among authors evidently exists. Five authors are listed under the main
descriptor Business and also under Sports, while only four are listed under Social, and
three under both the Politics and Arts and Film headings. The advantage of this corpus
is that it contains articles written in a similar register, targeting the same audience,
during the same short period of time (1995), and by authors sharing a common back-
ground and culture. Moreover, throughout all articles copy-editors and proofreaders
impose respect for the in-house newspaper style, correct orthography (spelling, punc-
tuation, and capitalization) while also reinforcing the use of the same vocabulary and
naming conventions (e.g., Beijing or Peking).
The “Number” column in Table I lists the number of articles written by each author,
showing a minimum of 30 (Fowler John), and a maximum of 433 (Wilson Andrew). This
distribution is rather skewed, with a group of eight authors having published more
than 350 articles, and another group of four journalists in this corpus writing less than
100 articles (mean: 270, median: 332, standard deviation: 139). Moreover, an analysis
of article length shows that the mean number of word tokens is 725 (minimum: 44,
maximum: 4,414, median: 668, standard deviation: 393), an overall value closely
reflecting only one of the chosen authors (Gallacher Ken), in terms of the mean tokens
length of 727 per article, as reported under the column “Mean Length”. This mean

value varies widely across journalists indicating that Davidson writes longer articles,
on average, (mean: 1,310) while Wilson has the shortest mean (452).
As a second evaluation corpus, we selected newspaper articles published in La
Stampa during the year 1994, a subset comprising 58,051 documents, of which 37,682
included the name of the author(s). This corpus is part of the CLEF 2003 test collec-
tion [Peters et al. 2004], which is available publicly through the ELRA Web site. In
selecting this corpus, our intention was to verify the quality of the different authorship
attribution methods using a language other than English.
From the set of all possible articles, we must ignore articles written by more than
one author, as well as authors contributing to only a few texts. In order to form a
suitable test collection, we thus chose 20 authors (see Table II), either as well-known
columnists (names in italics) or as authors having published numerous papers in 1994.
This selection process resulted in a set of 4,326 articles.
The “Number” column in Table II lists the number of articles written by each author,
showing a minimum of 52 (Nirenstein Fiama), and a maximum of 434 (Del Buono
Oreste). An analysis of article length shows that the mean number of word tokens is
777 (minimum: 60; maximum: 2,935; median: 721; standard deviation: 333). As for
the Glasgow Herald corpus, this mean value varies widely across journalists indicating
that Spinelli writes longer articles, on average, (mean: 1,478) while Conti has the
shortest mean (612). In the selected newspaper articles, we automatically remove the
author name (full name or first name) as well as some recurrent phrases (e.g., Dal
nostro (or della nostra) corrispondente, nostro servizio, etc.).
3.2. Evaluation Measures
We use the accuracy rate as evaluation measures, meaning the percentage of correct
answers that can be computed according to two distinct schemes. As a first method, the
micro-averaging principle assumes that one decision corresponds to one vote. When
the system is able to correctly identify, for example, the right author for 3,166 articles
out of a grand total of 5,408 articles, the resulting accuracy rate (micro-average) is

3166/5408 = 0.5854 or 58.54%. In authorship attribution this is the method most
frequently used to compute mean performance.
As a second method we first compute the accuracy rate obtained for each of the 20
authors (or categories), under the assumption that we attach the same importance
to each author (or category). In this case, one author corresponds to one vote (macro-
average), and thus the overall accuracy rate is the mean of all categories. For example,
if we obtain an accuracy rate of 0.7 for the first author, 0.4 for the second, and 0.8 for
the third, then the macro-averaging accuracy rate is (0.7 + 0.4 + 0.8) / 3 = 0.633, or
63.3%. When we have the same number of texts for each author, both measures return
the same value but, as depicted in Tables I and II, this is not the case in our evaluation
corpora.
Both the micro- or macro-average measures are presented in this study and either
can be used. In the machine learning domain, the first one usually tends to produce
better results because frequent categories are assigned more importance, and are usu-
ally easier to predict. With more data, a frequent category (or author) might be more
precisely defined or the underlying classifier would have more training data to distin-
guish between this particular category and the others.
To determine statistically whether or not a given attribution method would be bet-
ter than another scheme, we apply the sign test (or s-test) [Conover 1980] in which
the null hypothesis H0 states that both attribute models result in similar performance
levels [Yang and Liu 1999]. When applying a two-sided test, n′ denotes the number of
times that the assignment resulting from each of the two models is different. Moreover,
t+ represents the number of times that the first system proposes a correct assignment
while the second system indicates an incorrect decision. Under the H0 assumption
stating that both schemes produce similar performance, t+ follows a binomial distribu-
tion with parameter p = 0.5 and n′. Thus at a given significance level α, the expected
limit for the t+ value is
t = 0.5 ·

n′ − za/2 ·
√
n′
)
.

When fixing the significance level α = 5%, the zα/2 value is 1.96 (or 2.57 for a signifi-
cance level at α = 1%). The null hypothesis is rejected if the observed value t+ is smaller
than t or greater than n′ − t.
When applying the sign test to the macro-averaging method, we compare the two
attribution schemes using the 20 means (one per category or author). In the current
evaluation, we consider them as equal if the absolute value of the accuracy difference
between two authors is smaller than 0.001. Of course, due to the fact that the value of
n′ (the number of times that the accuracy per author between the two models differs)
is much smaller than that of the micro-averaging method, the sign test does not detect
many significant differences.
4. TEXT CLASSIFICATION MODELS
To design and implement an automatic authorship attribution system we need to
choose a text representation mechanism that is beneficial when classifying the texts,
and also a classifier model. Section 4.1 describes the common form of representation
used in our experiments. To provide a comparative view of the relative merits of the
three attribution models, in Section 4.2 we choose the Delta rule, in Section 4.3 the χ2
statistic, and in Section 4.4 the KLD approach. Furthermore, the definition of term
specificity based on the Z score is described in Section 4.5, while in Section 4.6 we de-
fine a distance between text pairs and then evaluate the suggested authorship attribu-
tion method and compare it with the best performance levels achieved when applying
the three other schemes. In Section 4.7, we present a set of additional experiments
using the same set of terms to evaluate the four author attribution schemes while
Section 4.8 compares the effectiveness of the Z score method with the naı̈ve Bayes,
a well-known approach used in machine learning. Finally Section 4.9 estimates the
reliability of the suggested Z score distance.
4.1. Preprocessing and Text Representation
Even though Kešelj et al. [2003] found that character n-gram representation could
be effective in authorship attribution as well as in the information retrieval domain
[McNamee and Mayfield 2004], we prefer a method capable of clearly verifying text
representation generated, and thus our text representations are based on words.
Before trying to classify the newspaper articles, we first need to preprocess them.
We begin by replacing certain system punctuation marks (in UTF-8 coding) with their
corresponding ASCII symbols, and replacing single (‘’) or double quotation marks (“”)
with the (’) or (”) symbols. For the English language only, we remove a few diacritics
found in certain words (e.g., naı̈ve). To standardize spelling forms we also expand
contracted forms or expressions (e.g., don’t into do not) and replace uppercase letters
with their corresponding lowercase equivalents, except for certain words written only
with capital letters (e.g., US).
To break the stream of text into tokens, we apply the tokenization algorithm de-
veloped by Grefensette and Tapanainen [1994], and thus consider words such as
soldiers and soldier to be distinct forms, as we do for each of the conjugated verb
forms (e.g., writes, wrote, or written). Moreover, we do not distinguish between pos-
sible homographs (e.g., the verb to desert, and the noun desert) by considering their
Part-Of-Speech (POS) categories. In the case of high-frequency words, for example,
this distinction provides an entry for to as the infinitive or another for to as preposition.
After this step, the resulting English vocabulary contains 56,447 distinct word
types, with 19,221 hapax legomenon (words occurring once), and 7,530 dis legomenon
(words occurring exactly twice). When considering only those types having an occur-
rence frequency of 10 or more, we count 14,890 types, or 9,628 types having frequencies
ACM Transactions on Information Systems, Vol. 30, No. 2, Article 12, Publication date: May 2012.

equal to or greater than 20. The most frequent token is the (219,632 occurrences), fol-
lowed by the comma (183,338 occurrences), the period (146,590), and ranking fourth is
the token to (95,350), followed by of (92,755), and a (78,867).
From the newspaper La Stampa, we find 102,887 distinct word types, with 41,965
hapax legomenon, and 14,944 dis legomenon. In this corpus, we can count 19,580
word types having an occurrence frequency of 10 or more, and 11,410 types having fre-
quencies equal to or greater than 20. The most frequent token is the comma (212,736
occurrences), followed by the period (126,891), and the word type di (of) (100,433), and
ranking fourth is the token e(and) (73,818), followed by il (the) (63,931), and che (that)
(59,600).
In order to define the underlying characteristics of each author, we form an author
profile by concatenating all texts written by the same person. From this subset, we
then apply the feature selection procedure, and represent each author profile or dis-
puted text by a set of weighted features.
In all experiments, the query text is never included in the corresponding author
profile. Moreover, not using this test data during the learning stage or when build-
ing the author profile is considered as a fair evaluation principle. In our experi-
ments, the preprocessing of the texts was done using Perl [Bilisoly 2008; Nugues
2006] while the classification and the evaluation were performed using the R system
[Crawley 2007].
4.2. Delta Rule
To determine the probable author of a given text, Burrows [2002] suggests account-
ing for the most frequent word types (and particularly function words) without tak-
ing punctuation marks or numbers into account. In an original proposition, Burrows
suggests considering from 40 to 150 most frequently occurring word types, with 150
words obtaining the best results. Unlike in Burrows’ study, we did not distinguish
between homographs, as, for example, between that as a conjunction or as a relative
pronoun. We must admit that this selection criterion is rather simple to apply, and
that computational costs are relatively low, particularly when ignoring the ambigu-
ity of the homographs. On the other hand, taking account of these differences would
increase underlying manual or computational costs, rendering this authorship attri-
bution method less appealing.
When comparing two texts, Burrows [2002] suggests that the second important as-
pect is not the use of absolute frequencies, but rather their standardized scores. These
values are obtained by subtracting the mean and then dividing by the standard devia-
tion (Z score) [Hoover 2004a], and once these dimensionless quantities are obtained for
each selected word, they can be compared to those obtained from other texts or author
profiles. We compute the Z score for each term ti (word type) in a text sample (corpus)
by calculating its term relative frequency tfrij in a particular document Dj, as well as
the mean (meani), and standard deviation (sdi) of term ti according to the underlying
corpus (see Eq. (1)) [Hoover 2004a].
Z score(tij) =
tfrij − meani
sdi
(1)
From the Z score value attached to each term, we can compute a distance between
each pair of texts. Then, given the query text Q, and the author profile Aj, and a
set of terms ti, for i = 1, 2, . . . , m, we compute the Delta value (or the distance) by
applying Eq. (2). In this formulation we attach the same importance to each term ti,
independently of their absolute occurrence frequencies. Large differences may occur
when, for a given term, both Z scores are large and have opposite signs, and in these

while the other employs it very infrequently. On the other hand, when for all terms

The Delta method was originally applied in the Restoration poetry corpus [Burrows
2002], and Hoover [2004b] demonstrated that this method could be effective in a prose
corpus containing either dialog or more narrative content (American English texts
from the end of the 19th century to the beginning of the 20th century). In this case
the text excerpts contained 10,000 to 39,000 word tokens, with a mean length value of
27,000.
In a related study, Hoover [2004a] suggests ignoring personal pronouns in the list
of high-frequency words (it is not clear whether this suggestion was made in relation
to the underlying corpora or should be applied in all cases). The resulting effect might
be small, however, given the rather small number of personal pronouns in a list of 600
to 800 entries.
Table III shows the evaluation obtained with the Delta method using the GH corpus
while Table IV reports the same information for La Stampa. Under the “Parameter”
heading we list the number of high-frequency words taken into account, and when
personal pronouns are ignored (- PP). In the last two columns, we report the accuracy
rate computed with the micro-average rate (one vote per text) and macro-average rate
(one vote per author). Even though micro-averages result usually in lower performance
levels, the same conclusions could be drawn from both measures and both corpora. The
best performance is obtained using 400 words, and accounting for more words tends
to diminish the classifier’s quality. Removing the personal pronouns (“- PP”) tends to
reduce performance levels when considering 400 words, but has no real impact when
using 600 or 800 word types.
Using the sign test and the best performance (400 words) as baseline, we add a
cross (†) to indicate significance performance differences (significance level α = 5%,
two-sided) or a double cross (‡) for significance differences having a significance level
α = 1% (two-sided). As shown in Tables III and IV, the performance differences with
the best parameter settings tend to be statistically significant when considering the
micro-average measure. When using the macro-average indicator however perfor-
mance differences tend to be nonsignificant, mainly due to the fact the sample size
is reduced to 20 (authors).
The statistical tests listed in the bottom part of Tables III and IV, compare the per-
formance differences with and without personal pronouns (- PP). In this case, ignoring

In the Delta method the feature selection criterion is rather simple, given that it is
based only on occurrence frequencies, and word distributions across texts or authors
are ignored. This strategy favors words with high occurrence frequencies, even when
the underlying occurrences appear only in a few but long documents instead of con-
sidering words occurring in a large number of texts or author profiles. Moreover, the
feature’s capacity to discriminate between different authors is not taken into account.
Hoover [2004a] suggests considering occurrence distributions across the different
texts by ignoring those word types for which a single text supplies more than 70% of
their occurrences (culling process). In the GH corpus, for example, we count 193 word
types having occurrence frequencies greater or equal to 10, and for which a single text
contains more than 70% of all occurrences. Here the term Nuremberg is found to be
the most extreme case, having the highest occurrence frequency (47) and with only
a single document containing 37 occurrences (or 82%), and thus in this context the
culling process has no real effect. From a set of 14,890 words occurring 10 times or
more, removing 193 (or 1.3%) of the entries might have no visible impact. Moreover, in
our example, a word type having an occurrence frequency of 47 is not ranked among
the top 800 most frequently occurring word types (ranking 800 is the term media with
a frequency of 476, and at 1000 is conservative, with a frequency of 381).
4.3. Chi-Square Distance
As a second baseline, we select one of most effective text representations found in
an empirical study [Grieve 2007]. This effective text representation is based on the
relative frequency of word tokens together with punctuation marks, comprising the
eight symbols (. , : ; - ? ( ’). For feature selection, instead of accounting for all word
types, Grieve [2007] considers words in a k-limit profile, where k indicates that each
word type must occur, at least, in k articles written by a given author and for every
possible author (e.g., a value k = 5 imposes the presence of the corresponding term
in at least five articles written by every possible author). This selection criterion can
also be analyzed as a minimum document frequency value on a per-author basis. As
effective values for the parameter k, Grieve [2007] observed that the best performance
results were achieved when k = 2, k = 5, or k = 10 (knowing that each author had
written exactly 40 texts in a corpus of 1,600 newspapers articles). Although increasing
the value of k reduces the number of word types taken into account, a small value for
k implies that we consider more words, and particularly more content words.
To compare the representation of a given text Q with an author profile Aj, Grieve
[2007] uses the χ2 statistic defined by Eq. (3) in which q(ti) represents the ith feature
ACM Transactions on Information Systems, Vol. 30, No. 2, Article 12, Publication date: May 2012.
Authorship Attribution Based on Specific Vocabulary 12:13
in the query text, and aj (ti) the corresponding ith feature in the jth author profile, for
the set of terms ti, for i = 1, 2, . . . , m, . In the current case, the values of q(ti) and aj (ti)
become the relative frequencies of a given word or punctuation symbol.
χ(Q, A j) =
m∑
i=1
(
q(ti) − aj (ti)
)2/
aj (ti) (3)
When comparing a text with different author profiles, we simply select the lowest χ2
value to determine the most probable author. Admittedly, when computing this metric,
many small values for either q(ti) or aj (ti) could be problematic [Knuth 1981]. Grieve
[2007] did not, however, specify any special treatment, and thus we strictly followed
the described procedure. When applying the 2-limit of course, all aj (ti) values would
be greater than zero, and thus the divisor shown in Eq. (3) would never be zero. The 2-
limit does in fact impose that each word or punctuation mark must appear in at least
two documents. At the limit, the author profile minus the query text would contain
one occurrence of the given term, and the corresponding aj (ti) would therefore always
be greater than zero.
In this scheme, feature selection is based on the document frequency (df ), consid-
ered in information retrieval to be a useful relevance indicator [Manning et al. 2008].
The df value is nonetheless not computed for the entire corpus, but rather on a per-
author basis. Using document frequency as selection feature has also been found effec-
tive in other text categorization problems, as mentioned by Yang and Pedersen [1997].
This suggests that DF (document frequency) thresholding, the simplest
method with the lowest cost in computation, can be reliably used instead
of IG (information gain) or CHI (χ2-test).
With the GH corpus, the 30-limit is chosen as the maximum because we only have
30 articles written by Fowler John. In this case, the system can select 15 terms, being
{a and as but from in is it of that the to with , . }. When using the corpus La Stampa,
the system may select up to the limit of 52 (corresponding to the maximum number of
articles written by one author, F. Nirenstein in this case). Appearing in all texts, we
find the following 20 word types and punctuation marks {a al che da del della di e è i
il in l la non per un . , ’ }.
The accuracy rates analysis reported in Table V (GH corpus) or Table VI (La
Stampa) indicates that the best performance under micro-average measure is achieved
when considering the 2-limit constraint, involving more words and punctuation sym-
bols than with the other solutions. For the GH corpus, the 5-limit produces the best
accuracy rate when considering the macro-average metric. For both corpora, however,
performance differences between the 2-limit or 5-limit schemes are rather small, but
when compared to other parameter settings, the performance differences are relatively
important. Using the best performance as baseline and applying a two-sided sign test,
a double cross (‡) indicates a significant performance (significance level α = 1%) while
a single cross (†) is associated with a significance level of 5%. As shown in Tables V
and VI, the performance differences with the best parameter setting are always statis-
tically significant when analyzing micro-average measure. Using the macro-average
measure, the performance differences with the best parameter setting tend not to be
significant, except with the GH corpus where the sign test detects significant differ-
ences with the 20- and 30-limits.

list contains 363 terms, mainly function words (e.g., the, in, but, not, am, of, can) and
also certain frequently occurring forms (e.g., became, nothing). Other entries are not
very frequent (e.g., howbeit, whereafter, whereupon), while some reveal the underly-
ing tokenizer’s expected behavior (e.g., doesn, weren), or seem to correspond to cer-
tain arbitrary decisions (e.g., indicate, missing, specifying, seemed). Zhao and Zobel’s
[2007a, 2007b] study is limited to the English language, and thus for the Italian lan-
guage we select an Italian stopword list provided by a search system achieving high
retrieval performance in CLEF evaluation campaigns for that language [Savoy 2001].
After defining the feature set, the probability of occurrence of each item associated
with a given author or a disputed text then has to be estimated.
Based on these estimations, we can measure the degree of disagreement between
two probabilistic distributions. To do so Zhao and Zobel [2007a, 2007b] suggest using
the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) formula, also called relative entropy [Manning
and Schütze 2000], a choice that has proven effective in the information retrieval do-
main [Zhai and Lafferty 2004]. The KLD value expressed in Eq. (4) indicates how far
the feature distribution derived from the query text Q diverges from the jth author
profile distribution Aj. We have
KLD(Q||A j) =
m∑
i=1
pq(ti) · log2
[
pq(ti)
pj (ti)
]
, (4)
where pq(ti) and pj(ti) indicate the occurrence probability of the term ti in the query
text or in the jth author profile, respectively. In the underlying computation, we state
that 0.log2[0/p] = 0, and p.log2[p/0] = ∞.
With this definition and when the two distributions are identical, the resulting value
is zero, while in all other cases the returned value is greater than zero. With this
approach the main concern is accurately estimating the different probabilities. As a
first estimate for the occurrence probability of term ti (namely pq(ti) or pj (ti)), we apply
the maximum likelihood principle and estimate it as
p(ti) = tfi
/
n, (5)
ACM Transactions on Information Systems, Vol. 30, No. 2, Article 12, Publication date: May 2012.
Authorship Attribution Based on Specific Vocabulary 12:15
where tf i indicates the term frequency (or the number of occurrences) of term ti in the
underlying text or sample, and n the sample size (number of tokens). This first solution
tends to overestimate the occurrence probability of terms appearing in the sample, at
the expense of the missing terms. Since the occurrence frequency for the latter is 0,
its probability would also be 0, as, for example, when an author does not use a given
term. We know, however, that the word distribution follows the LNRE law (Large
Number of Rare Events [Baayen 2001]), whereby new words always tend to appear. To
correct this problem we apply a smoothing technique that also has the advantage of
eliminating any special processing resulting from an occurrence probability of 0. This
kind of problem could, for example, occur with the Delta formulation [Hoover 2007], or
in Eq. (3) (χ2statistic) when aj (ti) equals zero.
As a first approach, Laplace suggests adding one to the numerator in Eq. (5) and
likewise adding the vocabulary size to the denominator [Manning and Schütze 2000].
This approach could then be generalized by using a λ parameter (Lidstone’s law
[Lidstone 1920]), resulting in the following probability estimates: p = (tfi + λ)/(n +
λ · |V|), with |V| indicating the vocabulary size. In our experimentsge suggest fixing
this λ value to 0.1, a choice that avoids assigning a relatively higher probability to
rare words, since in authorship attribution rare words are usually not of prime impor-
tance. Moreover, in certain circumstances maximum likelihood estimation would be
better [Gale and Church 1994], thus justifying a smaller value for the parameter λ.
Finally, when compared to the Good-Turing approach [Sampson 2001], this smoothing
technique is rather easy to implement.
As an alternative, Zhao and Zobel [2007a, 2007b] suggest using the Dirichlet
smoothing method, which estimates occurrence probabilities by applying the follow-
ing equation. We have
p(ti) =
tfi
μ + n
+
μ
μ + n
· pB(ti), (6)
where pB(ti) is the probability of term ti in the background model, and μ a parameter
applied to adjust the importance of direct estimation versus that of the background
model.
With this approach, the resulting estimation relies on a mixture of direct estimation
(tfi/μ + n) and probability provided by the background model B. This latter model
is useful when the corresponding frequency tfi equals 0, or when the size n of the
underlying sample is small, often resulting in inaccurate estimates. In such cases,
the background model may provide better estimates of the underlying probabilities.
To generate the background model used in our experiments we considered all 56,472
articles published in the Glasgow Herald or the 58,051 articles in La Stampa. The
value for the parameter μ was set at 1000*
√
10, because this value achieved the best
performance in Zhao and Zobel’s [2007a, 2007b] experiments. Assigning a high value
to this parameter usually gives more importance to the background model, with the
possible μ values typically falling within the range of 0.001 to 10,000 [Zhao 2007].
In our experiments with the English language, we found 19 words in Zhao’s
[2007] list that could not be found in our corpus. For nine of them, their absence
was attributed to the fact that during the preprocessing we expanded the contracted
forms (e.g., aren, isn, wasn, weren). The other absences are caused by rare forms
(e.g., hereupon, inasmuch, whereafter) not appearing in the GH corpus. As such, our
experiments are based on 344 words (363 − 19), and for the Italian language we used
a stopword list containing 399 terms.
Using the GH corpus, Table VII compares performances achieved by the KLD ap-
proach after applying two different smoothing techniques (Lidstone or Dirichlet) while
for the Italian language Table VIII shows the same information. For both corpora

Lidstone’s smoothing scheme (λ = 0.01) provides the best performances, although
differences resulting from the Dirichlet method (μ = 100) are rather small and not
significant. Due to the additional computational costs required in the latter technique
(e.g., in estimating background probabilities), we prefer using the Lidstone’s approach.
As for the other evaluations, using the best performances as baseline and applying
a two-sided sign test, a double cross (‡) indicates a significant performance difference
with a significance level α = 1%, while a single cross (†) specifies it at a significance
level of 5%. These tests indicate that when using the Dirichlet smoothing method,
the best value associated with the parameter μ must be around 100 and this scheme
produces performance level similar to the Lidtsone’s method (with λ = 0.01).
4.5. Z-Score and Specific Vocabulary
As a new authorship attribution approach, we suggest representing each text based on
selected terms (word tokens and punctuation symbols in this study) corresponding to
its specific vocabulary, as proposed by Muller [1992]. To define and measure a word’s
specificity, we need to split the entire corpus into two disjoint parts denoted P0 and
P1. For a given term ti, we compute its occurrence frequency both in the set P0 (value
denoted tfi0) and in the second part P1 (denoted tfi1). In our authorship attribution
context, the set P0 would be the disputed text, while P1 the rest of the corpus. Thus,
for the entire corpus the occurrence frequency of the term ti becomes tfi0 + tfi1. The
total number of word tokens in part P0 (or its size) is denoted n0, similarly with P1 and
n1, and the size of the entire corpus is defined by n = n0 + n1.
For any given term ti the distribution is assumed binomial, with parameters n0
and p(ti) representing the probability of the term ti being randomly selected from the
entire corpus. Based on the maximum likelihood principle, this probability would be
estimated as follows.
p(ti) =
tfi0 + tfi1
n

Authorship Attribution Based on Specific Vocabulary 12:17
As explained in the previous section, a good practice is to smooth the probability esti-
mates [Manning and Schütze 2000]. In this study we applied the Lidstone’s technique
(with λ = 0.1), simple to implement, and producing reasonably good results [Savoy
2010].
Through repeating this drawing n0 times we are able to estimate the expected
number of occurrences of term ti in part P0 using the expression n0 · p(ti). We can then
compare this expected number to the observed number (namely tfi0), where any large
differences between these two values indicate a deviation from the expected behavior.
To obtain a more precise definition of large we account for variances in the underlying
binomial process (defined as n0 · p(ti) · (1 − p(ti))). Eq. (8) defines the final standardized
Z score (or standard normal distribution N(0,1)) for term ti, using the partition P0
and P1.
Z score(ti0) =
tfi0 − n0 · p(ti)√
n0 · p(ti) · (1 − p(ti))
(8)
For each selected term, we apply this procedure to weight its specificity according
to the underlying text excerpt P0. Based on the Z score value, we then verify whether
this term is used proportionally with roughly the same frequency in both parts (Z
score value close to 0). On the other hand, when a term is assigned a positive Z score
larger than δ (e.g., 2), we consider it overused or belonging to the specific vocabulary
of P0. A large negative Z score (less than −δ) indicates than the corresponding term is
underused in P0 (or similarly overused in P1). To illustrate this computation, we
have created an small example with six documents written by three authors in the
Appendix.
Using this technique, Savoy [2010] was able to determine, for example, the
specificity of the vocabulary used by J. McCain and B. Obama during a past U.S.
presidential campaign. In these speeches, for example, the terms jobs, health or
Bush characterized the Democrat candidate while nuclear, government, and judicial
appeared in the specific vocabulary of J. McCain.
Although it might be possible to compute the Z score for all terms, we would suggest
ignoring words having a small occurrence frequency (e.g., smaller than 4) or appearing
in a limited number of texts (df ). In the current context, our English vocabulary is com-
posed of 56,447 distinct word types. When ignoring all words having a term frequency
less than 10, having a document frequency (df ) less than 3 [Yang and Pedersen 1997],
or used by at a single author, we obtain a reduced set of 2,511 types (or 4.4% of the
initial vocabulary size). During this selection, we thus remove terms having a small
occurrence frequency or appearing in a very limited number of articles. Moreover we
also ignore terms used by a single author. This resulting set constitutes the vocabulary
(words and punctuation symbols) used in our Z score approach. A similar approach is
applied for the Italian corpus. Starting with 102,887 word types, we ignore terms
whose term frequency is less than 10 or having a document frequency less than 3. In
addition, we also impose that each term must be used by at least two distinct authors.
As a result, we obtain a set of 9,825 terms (or 9.5% of the initial vocabulary size).
Given that each author wrote more than one article, we generate an author profile
by computing the average term Z scores over all articles corresponding to that author
(see Appendix for an example).
When considering two GH columnists sharing certain common subjects (e.g., busi-
ness) such as Sims and McConnell, the computed Z scores attached to their respec-
tive profiles reveal some of their lexical affinities and divergences. According to the
Z scores, Sims’s ten most significant words are {profits, group, shares, investment, its,
market, income, insurance, though, shareholders} while for McConnell they are {trust,
company, its, bank, investment, during, value, assets, companies, fund}. These terms

12:18 J. Savoy
are clearly distinct from the most significant words used by Russell, whose main topics
are related to Arts and Film ({film, she, her, “,”, william, war, he, love, story, is}).
When inspecting the most significant words in these three author profiles, we are
able to find very frequently occurring words (e.g., its with an occurrence frequency of
8,251 or is with 42,588) as well as words having medium occurrence frequencies, such
as profit with a term frequency of 577, or insurance with 375. When applied to define
the most important features in each author profile, the Z score approach does not
employ term frequency directly but rather the fact that the occurrence frequency is, in
mean, higher or lower in articles written by that given author compared to all other
texts. This does not mean, however, that words specific to an author could not appear
in another profile (e.g., both its and investment appear among the most significant
terms used by Sims and McConnell).
4.6. Z-Score Distance and Evaluation
The previously defined Z score is assigned to each word (or punctuation symbol) found
in a text or an author profile. From these values we define the distance between a
query text Q and a given author profile Aj as defined by Eq. (9) and based on a set of
terms ti, for i = 1, 2, . . . m. We have
Dist(Q, Aj) =
1
m
·
m∑
i=1
(
Z score(tiq) − Z score(tij)
)2
, (9)
where tiq indicates the ith term in the query text, and tij indicates the ith term in the
jth author profile.
When both Z scores are very similar for all terms, the resulting distance is small,
meaning that the query text Q was probably written by the jth author. Moreover, the
squared difference tends to deduce the impact of any differences less than 1.0, which
would mainly occur in the common vocabulary. On the other hand, large differences
could occur when both Z scores for a given term are large and have opposite signs. In
this case the query text tends, for example, to use the underlying term more frequently
than the mean (term specific to the disputed text) while for the jth author, this term
is underused. To present this computation, an example is given in the Appendix.
The evaluation of the Z-score-based approach is given in Table IX for the GH corpus
and Table X for La Stampa. In these tables, we also added the best solutions found
with the Delta, χ2measure, or KLD schemes. Varying the value for the parameter λ
(1.0 or 0.1 in the current study) seems to have no real impact on both corpora, yet
when compared to the other models, the Z score method produces better performance
levels both for the document-based (micro-average) and author-based (macro-average)
measures.
Applying the sign test while using best performances as the baseline, we add a cross
(†) when detecting a significance difference at a significance level α = 5% (two-sided)
or a double cross (‡) when the significance level α = 1%. As shown in Tables IX and X,
the Z score approach performs significantly better than the χ2measure when consid-
ering both measures and corpora. Using the micro-average indicator, the performance
differences are statistically significant between the other approaches and the Z score
model. With the macro-averaging scheme, the performance difference is significantly
different with the Delta model for both corpora, and when using the Glasgow Herald,
the performance difference is also significant with the KLD model.
Unlike the Z score, the other three authorship attribution methods rely mainly on
function words or very frequent word types. In the Delta approach [Burrows 2002],
the selection criterion is based on term frequency information. When considering only
terms occurring with high frequencies, in both in English or Italian languages, we

mainly extract determiners, prepositions, conjunctions, pronouns, and auxiliary verb
forms, all belonging to parts-of-speech defining functional words as stated by Miranda
Garcia and Calle Martin [2007]. As a second authorship attribution method, we also
evaluated the χ2 measure [Grieve 2007], based on word types and punctuation symbols
respecting a minimal document frequency. In this case, one of the best performances
is achieved when considering all words and punctuation symbols appearing in at least
two of every possible author’s texts. As a third baseline Zhao and Zobel [2007a, 2007b]
suggest using the KLD scheme with a predefined feature list (containing 363 English
terms or 399 Italian words). This type of list corresponds to a stopword list in the IR
domain [Fox 1990], often applied to identify very frequently appearing forms having
no clear and important meaning. It is known, however, that for a given language dif-
ferent stopword lists might be suggested with possibly different retrieval effectiveness
[Dolamic and Savoy 2010].
Within the Z score approach and like the χ2measure, we do not apply a predefined
selection strategy. Using words as they appear in the underlying texts would provide
the information needed to more or less weight each selected feature. When some word
types are not used (e.g., hereafter, hereupon), we could simply ignore them, and this
could also apply to word types having a small term frequency (tf ) or having a small
document frequency (df ) as suggested by Yang and Pedersen [1997] and applied in
this study. On the other hand, word forms (e.g., acronyms) occurring frequently in a
corpus and capable of discriminating between authors must be selected in a manner
causing them to improve the overall quality of the authorship attribution scheme (e.g.,
SNP (Scottish National Party) or MPs (Member of Parliament) in the current study).
Simply considering more terms is not the best strategy, however, as demonstrated
by the results shown in Tables III and IV (Delta method), where 600 or 800 words
produced a lower performance level than 400 words.
4.7. Additional Experiments
So far we have used all authors and articles occurring in our corpora without dis-
tinguishing them according to the main topics. We can argue that considering only
authors on a given subject will render the authorship attribution more difficult. To
evaluate this argument, we have extracted from the Glasgow Herald (see Table I)
the five authors who wrote on Business (namely Young, McConnell, Reeves, Sims, and

Wilson), and the five journalists who wrote on Sports (Douglas, Gallacher, Gillon, Paul,
and Traynor). Under the Business subject, we can find 1775 articles, and 1943 under
the Sports headline.
With the newspaper La Stampa (see Table II), we have also extracted two subcor-
pora. The first one is composed by four journalists who wrote on Sports (Ansaldo,
Beccantini, Del Buono, and Ormezzano) while the second contains Political articles
written by ten columnists (Battista, Benedetto, Galvano, Gramellini, Meli, Nirenstein,
Novazio, Pantarelli, Passarini, and Spinelli). The subset covering Sports contains 1317
articles while the Politics headline occurs in 2026 papers.
When applying the four authorship attribution methods on these subsets, we
obtained the accuracy rates reported in Table XI for the Glasgow Herald, and in
Table XII for the La Stampa. The evaluations done on these subsets reveal similar
conclusions to those obtained on the whole corpus. The Z score method shows the
best performance, that is also statistically significant when compared using the
micro-averaging method (a significance level of 5% is indicated by †, and 1% with ‡).
Under the macro-average measure, the number of authors is too small to detect any
significant performance differences when using the sports or business subsets.
From the results reported in Tables XI and XII, we can conclude that limiting our
corpus to articles written in a given domain does not change our previous conclu-
sions. The Z score scheme tends to produce the best overall accuracy rate. The per-
formance differences are statistically significant under the micro-average measure.
When applying the macro-averaging evaluation technique, the number of authors
is rather limited and thus the statistical test cannot usually detect any significant
differences.
As a second additional set of experiments, we can evaluate the four authorship
attribution schemes using exactly the same set of terms instead of applying their
own selection method. To achieve this, we have considered choosing all terms having
a document frequency (df ) larger than or equal to a given threshold δ, for δ = 400,
200, 100, and 50. Using this criterion, we tend to favor terms appearing in many
different articles. A high threshold value limits the number of terms used in the
evaluations, and, by decreasing this threshold, we will consider more terms. We also
applied a similar selection procedure using the term frequency (tf, the occurrence
frequency in the underlying corpus) with different threshold values. The effectiveness
achieved with the Glasgow Herald under these two selection procedures is depicted

in Table XIII, and Table XIV shows the same information using the Italian corpus. In
both tables, only the micro-average measure was computed.
In Tables XIII and XIV, we added a double cross (‡) to indicate a significant perfor-
mance difference based on the sign test (significance level α = 1%, two-sided), using
the performance achieved by the Z score as baseline. The data depicted in these ta-
bles indicate that the Z score scheme usually achieves the best accuracy rate. When
comparing the Z score to other strategies, the performance differences are usually sta-
tistically significant. Only when the number of terms is limited (between 500 to 800)
are the performance differences not statistically significant between the Z score and
the KLD scheme.
Tables XIII and XIV also show that when the number of terms increases, the per-
formance tends to decrease for all schemes except for the Z score. This decrease is
clearly marked for the Delta approach, less so for the χ2 and KLD approaches. For the
Z score scheme, increasing the number of terms leads to a slightly improved perfor-
mance. Overall, the performance of the Z score method seems to be more stable with a
different number of terms used to represent the texts and author profiles.
4.8. Naı̈ve Bayes
Until now, we have presented authorship attribution methods following the classical
paradigm. In this vein, we have first selected a set of relevant terms. Then, based on a
ACM Transactions on Information Systems, Vol. 30, No. 2, Article 12, Publication date: May 2012.
12:22 J. Savoy
distance measure between the query text representation and author profiles, we have
defined the probable author as the one that depicts the smallest distance.
As another paradigm, we can apply a machine learning approach [Sebastiani 2002].
In this case, we first need to define a selection criterion to reduce the number of possi-
ble terms (term space reduction). This step is useful to reduce the computational cost
and to reduce the overfitting of the learning scheme to the training data. In a second
step, we use the training data to let the classifier learn from positive and negative
examples. In the current study, the training data will be formed by the whole corpus
minus the query text (leaving-one-out).
As an effective approach to text classification, we may use the Support Vector
Machine (SVM) model [Cristianini and Shawe-Taylor 2000; Joachims 2002]. This is
an adapted solution for binary classification problems where the SVM determines the
hyperplane that best separates the examples belonging to the two categories. In this
case best hyperplane refers to having the largest separation (or margin) between the
two classes (together with the reduction of the number of incorrect classifications).
However, in our context of applying the SVM approach on 20 categories, it requires a
combination of several binary SVM classifiers (with different possible variants [Duan
and Keerthi 2005]). Moreover, predicting the most effective text representation is a
rather difficult task (e.g., various stemmers weighting schemes, normalizations, and
kernel functions). Finally, as mentioned in the Introduction, the effectiveness is not
our main objective and we rather focus on a simple learning scheme able to explain
its decisions. This last requirement is not fully achieved by an SVM approach.
As another typical and simpler text classifier derived from the machine learning
paradigm, we choose the naı̈ve Bayes model [Mitchell 1997] to determine the possible
author between the set of 20 possible journalists (or hypotheses), denoted by Ai for
i = 1, 2 , . . . r. To define the probable author of a query text Q, the naı̈ve Bayes model
selects the one maximizing Eq. (10), in which tqj represents the jth term included in
the query text Q, and nq indicates the size of the query text.
Arg maxAi Prob[Ai|Q] = Prob[Ai] ·
nq∏
j=1
Prob[tq j|Ai] (10)
To estimate the prior probabilities (Prob[Ai]), we simply take into account the
proportion of articles written by each author. To determine the term probabilities
we regroup all texts belonging to the same author to form the author profile. For
each term tj, we then compute the ratio between its occurrence frequency in the
corresponding author profile Ai (tfji) and the size of this sample (ni).
Prob[tj|Ai] = tfij
/
n (11)
This definition (see Eq. (11)) tends to overestimate the probabilities of terms occur-
ring in the text with respect to missing terms. For the latter, the occurrence frequency
(and probability) was 0, so a smoothing approach had to be applied to correct this.
As for the other methods, we will apply Lidstone’s law through smoothing each esti-
mate as Prob[tqj|Ai] = (tfji + λ)/(ni + λ · |V|), with λ as a parameter (set to 0.1), and |V|
indicating the vocabulary size.
As a selection criterion, various measures have been suggested and evaluated. Fol-
lowing Sebastiani [2002], we have selected the Odds Ratio (OR), a selection function
found historically effective. For each term tj, for j = 1, 2, . . . m, and each author Ai for
i = 1, 2 , . . . r, we can compute the odds ratio defined by Eq. (12). In this formulation,
Prob[tj |Ai] indicates the probability that, for a random document, the term tj appears

knowing that this text was written by author Ai. Similarly, Prob[tj|¬Ai] indicates the
same probability except that the underlying document was not written by author Ai.
O R(tj, Ai) =
Prob[tj|Ai] · (1 − Prob[tj|¬Ai])
(1 − Prob[tj|Ai]) · (Prob[tj|¬Ai] (12)
If a given term tj appears mainly in the author profile Ai, the probability Prob[tj|Ai]
will be relatively high and, in contrast, the probability Prob[tj|¬Ai] will be relatively
small. As shown in Eq. (12), this phenomenon will assign a relatively high value for
the numerator compared to the denominator. The resulting OR value will be high.
The corresponding term tj is then viewed as able to discriminate between the author
Ai and the other possible writers.
Eq. (12) returns a value for each pair (term, author). In order to compare and rank
each term, we need a single value able to consider the term’s discriminative capability
over all categories (or authors in the current context). To aggregate the r values, one
for each author, Sebastiani [2002] indicates that the SUM operator (see Eq. (13)) tends
to produce the best results with the OR used as term selection function.
ORsum(tj) =
r∑
i=1
OR(tj, Ai) (13)
Using this machine learning scheme with our corpora, we achieved the micro-average
performances depicted in Table XV for the Glasgow Herald, and in Table XVI for La
Stampa. In a first evaluation, we have considered the naı̈ve Bayes with the OR SUM as
selection procedure. In a second experiment, we used the document frequency (df ) as a
selection function to rank all possible features, from the highest to the lowest. In this
case, we favor terms appearing in many articles over those occurring in a limited num-
ber of documents. Such a selection function is simple and efficient to apply and has
been found effective in text classification applications [Yang and Pedersen 1997]. The
same selection procedure was applied to define terms used with the Z score method
(performances reported in the last column). In these tables, we also added a double
cross (‡) to indicate a significant performance difference based on the sign test (signif-

The performances shown in these tables indicate that the Z score scheme achieves
the best accuracy rate. The performance differences with the naı̈ve Bayes model tend
to be statistically significant. Under the naı̈ve Bayes method, the performance differ-
ences between the two selection procedures are relatively large, indicating that the
term selection stage represents an important choice to achieving high performance.
Finally, when the number of terms selected increases, the performance differences be-
tween the naı̈ve Bayes and the Z score tend to be reduced.
4.9. Assignment Reliability
In Eq. (9), we define the Z score distance between two texts, or in our context between
a disputed text and an author profile. When handling several possible authors, the
suggested strategy is to assign the article to the author having the minimal Z score
distance. If this resulting minimum value is small, we are more confident that the cor-
responding author is the real author of the disputed document. On the other hand, if
the minimum mean squared difference is large, the author assignment must be viewed
as more doubtful.
In order to verify this assumption, we need a mean to predict the probability of
a correct assignment according to the minimum Z score distance computed from a
set of possible author profiles. To achieve this objective, we suggest using the logistic
regression approach [Hosmer and Lemeshow 2001], a statistical methodology used to
predict the probability of a binary outcome variable according to a set of explanatory
variables. In our context, we need to predict the probability of a correct assignment
based on a single explanatory variable, namely the minimum Z score distance. The
resulting model is defined according the following equation. We have
Prob
[
Assignement j is correct | Dist j
]
= π (Dist j) =
eα+β·Dist j
1 + eα+β·Dist j
(14)
within which Dist j is the minimum Z score distance corresponding to author profile Aj.
In this equation, the coefficients α (intercept) and β (slope) are unknown parameters
which fit the S-curve shown in Figure 1. The value of these coefficients is estimated
according the principle of maximum likelihood (the required computations are done
using the R package).
When using the Glasgow Herald corpus, the estimations return α = 2.31 and
β = −0.499. To examine the fit adequacy, we can use a single overall goodness-of-
fit statistic (Wald test [Hosmer and Lemeshow 2001]), as well as a test to assess the
significance of each coefficient. In our study, the entire logistic model is significant
and, for each coefficient, the null hypothesis stating that the corresponding value is
equal to zero is always rejected (significance level α = 1%). Using these estimates, the
probability that the assignment is correct when obtaining a minimum Z score distance
of 1 is 85.98% (see Eq. (14)). As depicted in Figure 1, this probability decreases when
the minimum Z score distance increases, as, for example, with a distance of 4, the re-
sulting probability is 57.86%, or only 33.6% when faced with a distance of 6 between
an author profile and a disputed text.
5. CONCLUSION
Text classification tasks involve numerous interesting challenges, particularly when
applied to authorship attribution. This article suggests a simple method based on word
usage in texts written by different authors. To evaluate and compare our suggested

scheme with other approaches, we used articles contained in a freely available news-
paper corpus written in English (Glasgow Herald, published in 1995). To complement
this first experiment, a second corpus written in the Italian language (La Stampa,
published in 1994) is also used. From these corpora we extract all articles written by
20 well-known columnists or journalists having published numerous articles.
For comparison purposes, we used the Delta method [Burrows 2002; Hoover 2004a]
based on the 40 to 800 most frequent word types, where for both languages the
highest accuracy rate was obtained with the top 400 most frequent types. As a second
authorship attribution method we also evaluated the χ2measure [Grieve 2007], based
on word types and punctuation symbols respecting a minimal document frequency
on a per-author basis. In this case, one of the best performances was achieved when
considering all words and punctuation symbols appearing in at least two texts for
each author. As a third baseline, we used the KLD scheme proposed by Zhao and
Zobel [2007a, 2007b] and based on a predefined set of 344 words in English, or 399
Italian terms. This last approach results in better performance levels that the Delta
and χ2 measure schemes. These three baselines do, however, produce accuracy rates
that are inferior to those obtained by the suggested Z scores. Finally, when comparing
with the naı̈ve Bayes model, we show that the performances achieved by the Z score
method are better than those obtained with this well-known machine learning
approach.
Using frequent word types as well as function words might be useful in author-
ship attribution, but the proposed Z score method selects features (word types and
punctuation symbols in our study) according to their distinct distributions in the un-
derlying texts. Our work focuses on a simple approach producing results that can be
easily interpreted and require only certain easy to understand parameter settings (e.g.,

It is our opinion that these computer-based methods should not be viewed as the
only devices capable of recognizing the real or ghost author behind a text. They should
rather be viewed as complementary methods, especially given that none of them is
able to determine the right author with absolute certainty in all cases. Such computa-
tional linguistic approaches could be reserved as signals that complement additional
evidence obtained from other useful sources of external information (incipits, titles, di-
aries, correspondence, publishers’ records), biographical information, classical stylis-
tic methods (synonyms, prosody, metre), along with earlier attribution studies [Love
2002].
APPENDIX
In order to illustrate the computation of the Z score approach, we have built a small
example composed of six documents written by three authors denoted as A, B, and C.
To indicate the corresponding author of each paper, we add the letter A, B, or C in
each document’s identifier. As we can see in Table XVII, we have first the query text
(denoted by Q) followed by two documents for each possible author. For each paper,
we count the occurrence frequency of six word types. In the last line, we indicate the
size of each paper as the sum of these frequencies. Based on this information, we
can see that the longest paper is document C1, while the shortest is Q. In the column
“Sum,” we indicate the number of occurrences of each word type in the corpus formed
by papers A1 to C2. The most frequent word type is the determinant the, followed by
the preposition of. Finally, the size of this corpus is 1,915.
Now we want to determine the possible author of query text Q. According to the
explanation given in Section 4.5, we consider two parts in our corpus; the first, de-
noted as P0, corresponds to the single document Q, and P1 regroups the six documents
(A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, and C2). According to Eq. (7), we can estimate the occurrence
probability of each word type as its occurrence frequency in parts P0 and P1 divided
by the size of the corpus (n = 1915 + 151 = 2066). For the determinant the, this esti-
mate is (85 + 1059) / 2066 = 1144 / 2066 = 0.554. In Table XVII, we have added these
estimations in the last column under the label “Prob”.
To compute the Z score of each word type and for each document, we applied Eq. (8).
For the word type the and document Q, we obtain
Z score(the, Q) =
85 − 151 · 0.554√
151 · 0.554 · (1 − 0.544) =
85 − 83.613√
37.314
= 0.227
We repeat this computation for all remaining word types and documents to get the
Z score values depicted in Table XVIII.
To determine the possible author of document Q, we will compare the Z score val-
ues obtained from the query document to the different author profiles. To define an

author profile, we simply compute the average of the Z score values for each word type
obtained for all papers written by that author. For example, for the preposition of and
the author C, the resulting Z score is (2.145 + 1.007) / 2 = 1.576. Table XIX shows the
corresponding Z score values for the other word types and authors.
Finally, we need to compute the Z score distance between the query text Q and the
three profiles according to Eq. (9). For the word type the and author A, we calculate
the Z scores difference (0.227 − 0.831), and take the power of two of this difference
(−0.6042 = 0.364). These intermediate values are depicted in Table XX for the other
word types and author profiles.
The overall distance between the query text and a given author profile is the average
over all word types. In our example, this average is 0.128 with the author profile A,
7.117 with B, and 9.09 with the last possible writer. The Z score scheme suggests
that the probable author of document Q is author A, the one depicting the smallest
distance.
