Abstract
Pliny the Younger’s letter to Trajan regarding the Christians is a crucial subject
for the studies on early Christianity. A serious quarrel among scholars concerning
its genuineness arose between the end of the 19th century and the beginning of
the 20th; per contra, Plinian authorship has not been seriously questioned in the
last few decades. After analysing various kinds of internal and external evidence
in favour of and against the authenticity of the letter, a modern stylometric
method is applied in order to examine whether internal linguistic evidence
allows one to definitely settle the debate.The findings of this analysis tend to
contradict received opinion among modern scholars, affirming the authenticity
of Pliny’s letter, and suggest instead the presence of large amounts of interpol-
ation inside the text of the letter, since its stylistic behaviour appears highly
different from that of the rest of Book X.

1 Background
The historical importance of Pliny the Younger’s
letter to Trajan regarding the Christians (Epistulae
X.96), together with the corresponding short answer
of the Emperor (Epistulae X.97), can hardly be
underrated. Pliny’s letter is the first pagan account
to refer to Christ and Christianity, and provides key
information on early Christian practices at the be-
ginning of the second century, as well as the attitude
of the Roman government towards them. Modern
scholars (e.g. Van Voorst, 2000, pp. 26–7) largely
agree on the authenticity of the letter in its entirety,
and Plinian authorship has not been seriously ques-
tioned in the last few decades, mainly since the
British historian Sherwin-White (1966, p. 691)
expressed his influential opinion in his outstanding
commentary on Pliny’s Letters, claiming that ‘it is
hardly necessary to defend the genuine character of
these two letters. The curious may refer to Durry’s
summary of that unnecessary controversy’. In fact,
before Sherwin-White, Durry (Pliny the Younger,
1947, pp. 69–72), Mayer-Maly (1956, p. 312), and
Vidman (1960, pp. 87–8), after summarizing the
‘consensus’ of opinion, decisively stood for the
genuineness of the two letters. Per contra, the
debate concerning the authenticity of these docu-
ments reached its acme in the period between the
end of the 19th century and the beginning of the
20th, chiefly in France, where even scholars of the
like of Charles Guignebert (1901, pp. 75–94) were
inclined to admit the spurious nature of some

fragments of this letter, radically concluding that
good critics cannot base their arguments on such
a dubious text.
Hence, is it really time to consider the inquiry
having reached the quiet harbour of res iudicatae?
In order to answer this question, it is necessary to
fix the main issues of the status quaestionis, recapi-
tulating both internal and external evidence in
favour of and against the authenticity of what we
will call hereinafter the Plinian Testimonium (PT).
This will enable us to introduce the contents of this
article and define its aim.
2 External Evidence: Textual
Tradition and Patristic Witnesses
Though no ancient manuscript containing Book X
of Pliny’s Letters (including the official correspond-
ence between Pliny and the Emperor Trajan) has
come down to us, the complex but fascinating
study of the textual tradition of Book X (e.g.
Tuccinardi, 2014) permits us to argue that such a
manuscript, the famous Parisinus discovered by
Joannes Iucundus of Verona in Paris, unquestion-
ably existed in the early 16th century. Moreover, the
presence of at least another manuscript, found by
Petrus Leander in Blois (Loire Valley) in the same
years, partially containing the correspondence with
Trajan and different from the Parisinus, must be
considered a more than plausible possibility
(Tuccinardi, 2014, pp. 23–7). Consequently, it can
be argued that no humanist of the 15th or 16th
centuries forged PT. Is this enough for establishing
the Plinian authorship of the disputed letter?
Obviously not. Actually, Stout (1954, pp. 52–4)
proved that the archetype of the 10-book collection,
from which all our knowledge of Book X is derived,
was an elaborately prepared edition of the Letters,
adding the correspondence with Trajan to the old
and well-known ‘corpus’ of Book I–IX. The editor
completed his work after Pliny’s time, at some time
before the end of the fifth century (Gibson, 2014,
p. 41). Stout was inclined to admit the later date,
being the terminus ante quem, the supposed date of
Pierpont Morgan fragment M462 (late fifth), the
oldest but incomplete manuscript of the 10-book
family. The editor of this collection was a competent
scholar, able to emend the text and to add tables of
contents at the start of each book. Consequently,
Christian additions might have been included in
PT some time before the new edition of the
Plinian ‘corpus’ was prepared by this learned scho-
lar, himself potentially having that literary skill to
interpolate Pliny’s letter concerning the Christians.
Not mentioned by any of the apologists of the
second century, a full paraphrase of the Plinian cor-
respondence about the Christians comes up in
Tertullian’s Apologeticum (II, 6–7) at the end of
the second century. Tertullian’s account diverges
from the narrative of Pliny in some details. The
same report, but quoted from Tertullian (Merrill,
1909), appears again in Eusebius (Historia
Ecclesiastica III, 33) and Jerome (Chronicon
CCXXI Olympias) in the fourth century and, at
the beginning of the fifth century and with greater
inaccuracies, in Orosius (Historiarum Adversum
Paganos, VII, 12) and Sulpicius Severus
(Chronicorum Libri duo, II, 31). Is Tertullian’s testi-
mony a guarantee for the trustworthiness of PT? It
is well known that Tertullian, in the same work
(Apologeticum, V, 2), mentions an alleged report
of Pilate to Tiberius from Palestine, testifying
events clearly showing ‘the truth of Christ’s divin-
ity’, a legend which, later, originated the spurious
fourth-century document known as Acta Pilati. But,
above all, yet in the Apologeticum (V, 6), Tertullian
cites letters of Marcus Aurelius where ‘he bears his
testimony that Germanic drought was removed by
the rains obtained through the prayers of the
Christians who chanced to be fighting under him’.
The Rain Miracle of Marcus Aurelius, occurring
during his German-Sarmatian wars between 171
and 174 AD, inspired the Christian tradition men-
tioned by Tertullian. A pagan legend, alleged by
Cassius Dio (Roman History, 71.8) and also repre-
sented in a famous scene on Marcus’ column at
Piazza Colonna in Rome, was converted into a
Christian tale after less than 30 years. Moreover,
in the fourth century, a Marcus Aurelius letter
of the kind of the one mentioned by Tertullian
was forged by some Christian, probably on the
basis of Dio’s report not yet tampered with by
the monk Xiphilinus (Kovács, 2009, pp. 113–21).

Consequently, as the abovementioned cases show, it
would be reckless to base the authenticity of PT on
Tertullian’s testimony, excluding a priori the possi-
bility that a supposed forger could have altered a
letter originally written by Pliny.
3 Internal Evidence: Historical
Consistency and Stylistic Features
It is admissible to doubt of the genuineness of
Pliny’s letter concerning the Christians if the text,
submitted to critical analysis, reveals historical in-
congruences and presents itself in a way unlikely to
be written by a Roman magistrate in the second
century. Besides, the letter should contain interpol-
ations and cuts altering the coherence of the narra-
tive development and betraying the apologetic or
hagiographic aim of the forger. Is this the case for
PT? A subject of contention among the scholars, at
least till the early 20th century, it is not the aim of
this work to reproduce their main arguments.
Notwithstanding this, it is worth to emphasize
that, in order to judge the historical consistency of
PT, it is necessary to have suitable tools. This means
having an adequate knowledge of the Christian
embryo inside the Roman world at the beginning
of the second century. Unfortunately, Pliny’s letter
about the Christians is not only the most ancient
pagan source able to enlighten this shadow cone,
but also the most important. Hence, risk of uncon-
scious self-referentiality is behind the corner, a
danger that the use of early Christian writings is
not able to circumvent.
Dealing with the stylistic features of PT allows us
to move to more solid ground. The stylistic peculi-
arity of Book X facing the ‘corpus’ of Book I–IX had
long since been acknowledged. Pliny himself defines
the letters required of him by his office inlitteratis-
simae litterae (Epistulae I.10), letters of the same
kind as those included in Book X. An exhaustive
analysis has been carried out by Gamberini (1983,
pp. 332–76), demonstrating that, in comparison
with Books I–IX, Book X is characterized by a lack
of figures of speech and that its letters point up a
complex hypotactic structure instead of the para-
taxis and brevity typical of the first nine books.
The strongest rebuttal against the deniers of
Plinian authorship of the letter concerning the
Christians arrived precisely on stylistic grounds.
First Mayor (1890, pp. 121–2) then Linck (1913,
pp. 43–4), extracting a list of terms and expressions
from the disputed letter, proved through the com-
parison with other letters written by Pliny, and es-
pecially those of Book X, that they are instead
characteristic of Pliny. After their philological ana-
lyses, it became very hard to suppose a forger having
that amazing skill necessary to construct ex novo the
letter, and, consequently, it would seem impossible
that a Christian forger could ‘imitate so precisely the
language and style of Pliny’ (Clavelle, 1971, p. 21).
But what about the hypothesis regarding the pres-
ence of Christian interpolations in a letter originally
written by Pliny? Of course, the critical analysis car-
ried out by the abovementioned scholars could not
be cogent and valuable for the entire text of PT and,
it is not a coincidence if—in the wake of Guignebert
(1901)—Ranovic (1949), Herrmann (1954), and
Sokolov (1956) carried on suspecting the presence
of Christian additions, more or less important,
altering the original text of the letter. One of the
arguments supporting this thesis is the unusual
length of the disputed letter, as even Sherwin-
White (1966, p. 691), while considering improbable
Herrmann’s attempt, is disposed to admit.
The main aim of the present article is to weigh
the linguistic evidence for and against Pliny’s
authorship of his letter concerning the Christians
in an objective manner, using a recently available
stylometric technique. This will allow us to verify
whether the language of PT is, in its entirety, actu-
ally characteristic of Pliny or not.
4 Stylometry: A Profile-based
Approach for Authorship
Verification
Stylometry is the study of the linguistic characteris-
tics carried out in order to determine authorship. Its
crucial assumption is that each author owns dis-
tinctive writing habits, independent of his/her will,
and since the author cannot intentionally alter these
features, they provide the most reliable data for an

objective stylistic inquiry. Large quantities of stylis-
tic features (lexical, syntactic, structural, etc.) have
been identified and exploited as style markers in
authorship attribution. The most successful and
robust methods are achieved by processing style
markers such as function words or character
n-grams (consecutive sequences of n characters) fre-
quencies. More in detail, character n-grams-based
method is a well-suited and language-independent
approach to represent text for stylistic purposes (e.g.
Stamatatos, 2009), especially when relatively short
documents (such as PT) are processed, being the
dimensionality of this representation considerably
increased in comparison to the word-based ap-
proach. Character n-grams are able to catch nuances
of style including lexical, syntactical, and morpho-
logical information.
Authorship verification is an important subfield
in authorship analysis and one of the most complex
tasks in style-based text categorization. Satisfactory
results have been achieved only in recent years.
Given a set of documents by a single author and
one document of questioned authorship, the prob-
lem is to determine whether the questioned docu-
ment was written by the same person who wrote the
known document set or not. Stamatatos et al.
(2000) first analysed the authorship verification
task, but it was with Koppel et al. (2007) and the
‘unmasking’ method that important outcomes were
attained. Applying ‘unmasking’ to books gives ex-
ceptional results but not as much if only short docu-
ments are available. Afterwards, Koppel and Winter
(2011) proposed a new n-grams-based approach
(the ‘impostors’ method) to determine whether
two documents were by the same author.
Exploiting documents chosen from external sources
(the Web), this method gives surprisingly good re-
sults even when the size of the questioned document
is no more than 500 words. Other studies focusing
on authorship verification for short texts like e-mail
messages were carried out by Iqbal et al. (2010) and
by Chen et al. (2011).
Recently, very promising results were achieved
using two Profile-based methods, both exploiting
n-grams features.
The first one, proposed by Brocardo et al. (2013),
yearns for identifying and keeping only the most
discriminant features of the authors’ writing
habits. In fact, the author profile consists of all
unique n-grams occurring in the related data set.
The discriminant criterion to establish if two docu-
ments are of the same author consists in merging
the two author profiles to be compared, thus calcu-
lating the percentage of unique n-grams shared by
the two data sets. A text is said to be a genuine
sample of an author only if this percentage is
above a threshold defined during the training
phase. The relevant results obtained in an experi-
mental evaluation based on the Enron e-mail data
set, even when short message blocks are analysed
(block size of 500 and even 250 characters), make
this approach promising for important future tasks,
such as detecting any Christian additions inside the
Pliny’s letter about the Christians (see Section 5).
Further improvements of the performance of this
method, also obtained through an expansion of
the feature set, were carried out in Brocardo et al.
(2014).
The second Profile-based method to solve
authorship verification problems, especially where
imbalanced document sets are compared (such as
PT and Book X), was proposed by Potha and
Stamatatos (2014). The Plagiarism Action Network
(PAN) 2013 evaluation lab on authorship identifi-
cation gave new impetus to the studies and Potha
and Stamatatos (2014), starting from the results
achieved in this competition and resting upon the
Common N-Grams (CNG) method for authorship
attribution introduced by Keselj et al. (2003), pro-
posed this new, more efficient method.
In the CNG method, writing style is exemplified
by character n-gram profiles, i.e. each document is
represented as a bag of character n-grams. Hence,
the author profile becomes the list of character n-
grams with the corresponding frequency of occur-
rence. Keselj also provided a Perl module
TEXT::NGRAMS able to process a text file returning
all n-gram frequencies, sorted in descending order,
up to the maximal specified length.
Accordingly, in the method proposed by Potha
and Stamatatos (2014, pp. 316–17), all samples of
known authorship are concatenated into a single
document, and a character n-gram representation
vector is extracted from this large document. This

vector represents the known author profile. Another
vector is then constructed from the questioned
document, and the two vectors are compared
using a dissimilarity (or similarity) function. If the
resulting score is above (or under) a certain thresh-
old, the questioned document is assigned to the
author of the known document set.
The effectiveness of the method depends on four
parameters, which have to be tuned. The first is the
order of character n-gram (n). The second is the
profile size (s) of the documents of known author-
ship (Lk). The third is the profile size of the disputed
document (Lu). The last one is the choice of the
dissimilarity (or similarity) function (d). Actually,
experimental results (Potha and Stamatatos, 2014)
show that on dealing with author profiles with
unbalanced sizes (i.e. Lk versus Lu), better perform-
ance is achieved if the maximum possible length of
Lu is used. In contrast, from the documents of
known authorship, only the most frequent character
n-grams must be used.
5 Investigating the Authenticity of
the PT
In view of the above, the Profile-based method pro-
posed by Potha and Stamatatos (2014) appears to be
an ideal approach to investigate the genuineness of
Pliny’s letter concerning the Christians. Actually, the
stylometric technique applied in this article to solve
the PT problem is largely based on it, being the
profile of the disputed document (Lu) extracted
from the text of PT and the profile of the documents
of Plinian authorship (Lk) extracted from Book X
except for PT. The reliability of this method should
also be bolstered by the well-known peculiarities of
Book X of Pliny’s Letters, making it a ‘corpus’ styl-
istically homogenous. Conformance in genre, in
register (all letters written to the Emperor Trajan),
and in time of writing—all these highly contribute
to its uniformity.
The discriminatory function chosen in the PT
problem is the Simplified Profile Intersection
(SPI), first used with good results in the Source
Code Author Profiling (Frantzeskou et al., 2006).
SPI is a similarity distance given by the size of the
intersection of the two profiles (Lk and Lu), con-
cretely measured counting the CNG between
them. Thus, only the first two parameters remain
to be tuned. Leaning on the experimental results
obtained by Eder (2011) on Latin prose and by
Potha and Stamatatos (2014) on the PAN 2013 ‘cor-
pora’, three values of n (n¼ 4, n¼ 5, and n¼ 6) and
two values of s (s¼ 500 and s¼ 1,000) are tested,
consequently creating six different models (see
Table 1).
The presence of non-Plinian additions in PT
might be detected by the low value of the similarity
function SPI obtained by merging the profiles of the
disputed letter with the one of Book X; the lower the
SPI score, the larger the interpolations. But, in order
to evaluate the SPI score, terms of comparisons are
required. For attaining this goal, the following op-
erations were carried out (see Fig. 1).
First, all non-Plinian letters (i.e. Trajan’s answers,
Domitian’s letter, etc.) were removed from Book X.
Then, Pliny’s letter concerning the Christians (PT)
was isolated from Book X, thereby originating two
texts: PT and BX-PT (i.e. the whole Book X except
for Pliny’s letter about the Christians). Next, the
‘corpus’ BX-PT was split into 15 fragments (herein-
after Pi, with i varying from 1 to 15), each one ap-
proximately of the same size as PT (i.e. 3,000
characters—see Table 2) and associated with the
complementary ‘corpus’ consisting of BX-Pi (i.e.
the whole Book X except for fragment Pi).
For each model and for each Plinian fragment,
the couples Lk (Pi) and Lu (BX-Pi) were created
using the Perl module TEXT::NGRAMS. Thus,
since the 15 fragments are of acknowledged
Plinian authorship, from the SPI values extracted
merging Lk (Pi) and Lu (BX-Pi) and for each
model, a list of the typical SPI values for Pliny’s

letters of Book X was obtained. On doing so, the
required terms of comparisons for the SPI values of
PT were created (see Table 3).
The Q-Q plots of the SPI values (see Fig. 2) sug-
gest that the samples are drawn from a normally
distributed population.
Because of the small samples size (N¼ 15), the
t-distribution (Student’s t-distribution) was con-
sidered to be more apt than normal distribution
in describing the probability properties of the SPI
arrays. Actually, t-distribution gives better results
than normal distribution whenever few number of
data points (N < 30 in general) are available.
Whereas a normal distribution describes a full
population, t-distributions describe samples drawn
from a full population normally distributed (differ-
ent t-distributions for different sample sizes; the
larger the sample, the more the t-distribution is
similar to the normal distribution). Student’s
t-distribution is leptokurtic; consequently, it has
higher density in the tails if compared with a
normal distribution having the same mean and
standard deviation (that means that the probability
of obtaining values very far from the mean is larger
than in the normal distribution).
Merging Lk (PT) and Lu (BX-PT), it is possible to
obtain—for each model—the resulting SPI values
for PT (see Table 4).
After having standardized all the SPI values,
exploiting the t-distribution properties of the
SPI data sets of the Plinian fragments (Pi), it is
possible to estimate—for PT—the probability
that such a text, in its entirety, originally belonged
to Pliny’s Book X. Of course, different probabilities
can be obtained adopting different models (see
Fig. 3).
The first relevant point to be noticed is that,
in all the tested models, the SPI value of PT always
has the lowest value among the Plinian fragments
of Book X. Moreover, the possibility that a generic
Plinian fragment of Book X has an SPI value
equal or less than the one of PT is, for all six
models, lower than 5.0% and, for four models
out of six, even less than 0.5%. The result
is that, regardless of the chosen model and con-
trary to the ‘consensus’ of opinion, the stylomet-
ric analysis seems to suggest the presence of

interpolations inside the text of PT. How large
these interpolations would be would depend on
the adopted model, being 0.5% 10 times lower
than 5.0%. Hence, the question arises: Which is
the best model? And how should n and s be
chosen? In accordance with which criterion?
Making some simplifications, it is possible to fur-
ther expand the investigation.
The best parameters n and s would be those that
are able to construct a model having the greatest
possible discriminatory power. This means finding
that model is more apt in distinguishing the
Plinian letters of Book X from other unrelated
letters.
In order to identify the best model, additional
fragments of letters from external sources were
used, approximately having the same size as PT
and specifically five samples from Cicero (Ad
Familiares, I, 1–7)—hereinafter Ci, with i varying
from 1 to 5—and five from Seneca (Ad Lucilium,
I, 1–6)—hereinafter Si, with i varying from 1 to 5
(see Table 5).
Thus, it was possible to calculate the correspond-
ing SPI values, merging both Lk (Ci) and Lk (Si)
with Lu (BX)—see Table 6.
A visual confirmation of the stylistic homogen-
eity of Book X can be appreciated in Fig. 4, showing
the SPI values of the samples from Book X (PT not
included) systematically above the SPI values of ex-
ternal sources.
Once again, harnessing the t-distribution proper-
ties of the SPI values of Pliny’s correspondence with
Trajan and aware of the unavoidable limitations of
the method (choice of the best method depending on
the choice of the external authors, by the choice of
the extracted samples and by their numbers), a
simple criterion was used to recognize the model
having greater discriminating power. For each
model, the maximum SPI (max-SPI) value of the
external documents (i.e. Ci and Si) was extracted,
identifying the best model as the one in which this
max-SPI value has the lowest probability to belong to
the Plinian correspondence with Trajan (see Table 7).

The results of the analysis are that the model
having greater discriminatory power is Model 3,
being the probability that the SPI value of the gen-
eric Plinian fragment is equal or less than the max-
SPI lower than 2.0%. A visual comparison between
the SPI values of Plinian fragments, PT, and max-
SPI is shown in Fig. 5.
For Model 3, the possibility that a generic Plinian
fragment of Book X has an SPI value equal or
less than the one of PT is 0.5%, an impressively
low probability. The unrelatedness of PT among
the other Plinian fragments of Book X can be
fully appreciated in Fig. 6, representing, in the
t-distribution diagram of Model 3, the SPI values
of all the textual fragments considered.
6 Conclusions
The findings of this analysis tend to contradict
received opinion among modern scholars affirming
the authenticity of Pliny’s letter concerning the
Christians. On the contrary, the results achieved
with a Profile-based method for authorship verifi-
cation suggest the presence of a large amount of
interpolation inside the text of the letter, as the

stylistic behaviour of the PT appears highly different
from the one of the rest of Book X. Moreover, ex-
ternal evidence on Pliny’s letter about the Christians
is not currently able to dismiss a conclusion strongly
based on stylistic grounds. Future works on this
subject would include testing the authenticity
of Pliny’s letter by different reliable methods (e.g.
Brocardo et al., 2013, 2014) and/or by the same
method but using different similarity functions.
Owing to the serious historical implications of the
outcome of this study, an important future objective
would be to detect any Christian additions inside
Pliny’s text. This challenging task may not be
a Chimera, if one considers the very promising re-
sults obtained by recent studies in authorship veri-
fication for very short messages (Brocardo et al.,
2013, 2014). Not overlooking the traditional tools
made available by the historical-critical method, it
seems imperative for future studies to take on this
new challenge by harnessing recent stylometric
tools.
