Abstract— Authorship recognition is a technique used to 
identify the author of an unclaimed document, or in case when 
more than one author claims a document. Authorship 
recognition has great potential  for applications in Computer 
forensics. The intended goal of this research is to identify a 
Chat bot by analyzing conversation log files. This is a novel 
area of investigation, as artificially intelligent authors have not  
been profiled based on their linguistic behavior. The collected 
data comes from chat logs between different Chat Bots and 
between Chat Bots and Human users. The initial experiments 
utilizing collected data demonstrate the feasibility of our 
approach. 
Keywords- Authorship attribution, Authorship recognition, 
Chat bot, JGAAP, Stylometry. 
 
I.  INTRODUCTION  
A significant amount of research has been done in the 
area of authorship attribution [1, 2]. Stylometry is the 
study of differentiating authors by their styles; a survey of 
the field has been presented by Stamatatos [3]. Four main 
methods of authorship identification are: lexical, syntactic, 
semantic, and content specific. In lexical methods, the 
word counts and distributions in the text to grasp more 
knowledge about the different kinds of statistical 
properties in the document. Syntactic methods focus on 
extracting specific features from the document and trying 
to use them to differentiate between documents. The 
semantic and content-based methods focus on vocabulary 
and choice of specific words in the document [4]. 
 Behavioral traits associated with each human give a 
way to identify the person by the biometric profile [5]. 
Certain characteristics pertaining to language, 
composition, and writing, such as particular syntactic and 
structural layout traits, patterns of vocabulary usage, 
unusual language usage, and stylistic traits remain 
relatively constant. Identifying and learning these 
characteristics is the main challenge for authorship 
identification [6]. 
 
 
 
Two major subfields of the authorship attribution are: 
• Authorship Recognition: In which we have more 
than one author claiming a document.  We need 
to decide who is the best candidate to be the 
correct author of the document after analyzing the 
document and comparing it with the author’s 
baseline profile. 
• Authorship Verification: In which we have an 
author claiming the ownership of a document, and 
we need to compare the author’s profile and the 
document analysis to see if he or she is the real 
author. 
A good example of the first type is the twelve 
Federalist papers claimed by both Alexander Hamilton and 
James Madison [7]. A good example of the second type is 
a threat letter. This type is mostly used in Forensic 
investigation. 
When talking about humans, a major challenge is that 
the writing style during the professional career of the 
writer might evolve and develop with time, a concept 
known as behavioral drift [8]. A similar problem arises 
with Chat bots, as they learn new styles of writing, will it 
still be possible to linguistically profile them? 
 
A. What is a Chat bot? 
A Chat bot, Chatter bot, Chatter box or Chatter robot is 
a computer application designed to simulate a conversation 
with a human user [9]. Chat bots are mainly used in 
applications such as online help, e-commerce, customer 
services, call centers, and internet gaming [10]. 
Chat bots are typically perceived as engaging software 
entities, which humans can talk to. Some Chatter bots use 
sophisticated Natural Language Processing Systems 
(NLPS), but many just scan for keywords within the input 
and pull a reply with the most matching keywords [11]. 
Chat bots are still a largely developing technology; 
consequently, quality of simulated conversations varies 
from realistic to mostly nonsense.  
B. Motivations: 
The online criminal community is utilizing Chat bots as 
a new way to steal private information, commit fraud and 
identity theft. The need for identifying Chat bots by their

II. APPLICATION AND DATA COLLECTION 
A. Application for collecting chat logs. 
A C# application was developed to connect two Chat 
bots from dozens available online and to start a chatting 
session between them for some time. The application saves 
three different text files for each session: one for the whole 
conversation, another one for the first Chat bot part, and 
the last file is the other Chat bot lines. Fig 1 presents the 
flow chart of the application used to collect the data. 
Fig. 1. The Chat bot Reloaded Application Flow Chart. 
 
 
 
To collect additional data, chat logs on Chat bot’s 
websites were used. Usually these logs were of chats with 
humans for the purposes of bot training. 
 
III. DATA PREPARATION 
The collected data had to be cleaned first from some 
labels like the Chat bot name, and time-date of 
conversation (Fig. 2). When using the chat logs taken from 
the Chat bot website, usually the file had both parties of 
the chat, so we had to remove the other person’s responses. 
 
Two applications were used on the data. The first was 
Stylometry [12] which was originally built for email 
authorship attribution. The versions available online 
didn’t show promising results and no further tests were 
made. The second application was the Java Graphical 
Authorship Attribution Project (JGAAP) [13]. It has a 
practical interface with very flexible options to choose 
from in each of its processing stages after loading the 
document set. The application allows you to state the 
author for each file or leave it as unknown (Fig.3), and 
save the set as a corpus. 
Fig. 2. Sample conversation between Chat bots. 
 
Fig. 4 illustrates five main available options: 
• Normalize white space 
• Null canonicize (No preprocessing) 
• Strip alpha numeric 
• Strip punctuation 
• Unify case 
 
One can add one or more preprocessing to all files or 
to any selected files. The next stage was the event set. It is 
more like the feature extraction stage; in which one can 
select what kind of feature to extract from the text files in 
this stage as shown in Fig 5. 
Fig. 3. The file loading stage in JGAAP. 
 
After selecting the feature extraction step, we step 
forward to the analyze stage or the classifier selection. 
One can choose from different classifiers to test on the 
data (Fig. 6). The last stage is the report and the result of 
classification. One will have a list of all the files with the 
Jeeney: hi. How are you today?  
SkyNet: I am excellent this refreshing 
winter day. 
Jeeney: What do you think of me? 
SkyNet: I have not come to a 
conclusion about what of me. 
Jeeney: Why didn't you? 
SkyNet: I thought it was the right 
course of action. 
Jeeney: Why did you think that? 
SkyNet: It is part of who I am. 
Jeeney: Oh, okay. 
TalkBot: Hi, I am TalkBot. 
Hal: I have never heard of that 
name. What nationality is 
TalkBot?  
TalkBot: Not that I recall. I often 
hear many things from people 
who drop by to chat but I sure 
don't remember it all. 
Hal: Not many people express 
themselves that way.  
TalkBot: Perhaps, but a 
significant number nevertheless. 
Hal: Sounds okay.

IV. CHAT BOTS USED. 
Eleven Chat bots were used in the initial experiments: 
Alice [14], CleverBot [15], Hal [16], Jeeney [17], SkyNet 
[18], TalkBot [19], Alan [20], MyBot [21], Jabberwock 
[22], Jabberwacky [23], and Suzette [24].  
As mentioned before, data was collected by different 
means; some from Chat bot sites themselves, other by 
letting two Chat bots talk to each other. Fig 8 shows some 
of the Chat bots used.

V. EXPERIMENTS 
For each type of preprocessing, different event sets 
and classifiers were tested (Fig. 9). A total of 306 
different tests were conducted on the data set. 
 
Fig 10 and 11 shows the results from the experiments 
conducted on the available data. It also shows how the 
data interacts with different selections of features when 
applying different classifiers. Table 1 shows the average 
accuracy for each classifier when using different features.  
 
The Juola & Wyner Cross Entropy classifier achieved 
the maximum accuracy [13]. The only drawback for this 
algorithm was speed; it was very slow to do the 
classification with JW Cross Entropy. Table 2 shows the 
average accuracy achieved for each Feature over all 
classifiers used. Maximum accuracy was achieved by the 
Vowel 2-3 letters words feature (60.30%), which finds all 
the words starting with vowels with a length of 2-3 letters. 
The minimum accuracy was obtained by using the Dis 
Legomena feature (20.96%). This feature calculates words 
appearing only twice in the document.

VI. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK 
 
Our experiments in profiling Chat bots by their 
linguistic behavior using authorship identification 
techniques did show the feasibility of such approach.  
 
JGAAP [13] has given us the ability to test each 
feature’s performance on our data. Trials showed that  
 
 
TABLE 3.  FEATURES’ DESCRIPTION 
 
‘Vowels 2-3 Letter words’ feature resulted in the highest 
average accuracy of (60.30%). Juola and Wyner Cross 
Entropy resulted in the highest average accuracy of 
(72.05%) but was slow. The only drawback was that we 
couldn’t try more than one feature at a time. The next step 
is to find out the best combination of features that can 
perform well on the Chat bot data set, and test the 
‘Stacking/Bagging’ technique of using more than one 
classifier on the data set to obtain higher classification 
accuracy.
