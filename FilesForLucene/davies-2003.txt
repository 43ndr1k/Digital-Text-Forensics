Models for multilingual subject access in online library 
catalogues : the ILO experience

Abstract 
 
Different models exist for providing users of library catalogues with subject access 
in the language of their choice. One model relies on online processing to translate 
subject terms at the time the catalogue record is accessed for searching, for 
display or for export. Another, less frequently discussed model uses pre-
processing, at a point in time before the catalogue record is available, to support 
multilingual subject access. This article discusses the experience of the 
International Labour Organization, where systems in use now or in the very 
recent past illustrate both models. The advantages and disadvantages of each 
model are summarized. 
 
Introduction 
 
Many libraries serve clients who speak a variety of different languages. Libraries 
located in officially bi- or multi-lingual countries, libraries in areas with large 
immigrant populations and libraries of international organizations must provide 
multilingual subject access to their online public-access catalogues (OPACs) in 
order to serve their varied clientele. There are, however, at least two different 
models for supporting multilingual subject access in a modern OPAC. In the first 
model, online processing at the time the catalogue is accessed provides access in 
different languages to the records in the library catalogue. In the second model, 
processing to support multilingual subject access is done offline, in batch, at 
some point in time before the user approaches the computer to do an OPAC 
search. This article describes both models by means of a case study of library 
systems formerly or currently in use at the International Labour Organization in 
Geneva, Switzerland, and discusses the advantages and disadvantages of each. 
 
First, what is multilingual subject access? In a simple unilingual library catalogue, 
subject headings or descriptors are entered in the language of the user 
populationâ€• only subjects in that language that can be retrieved and displayed. A 
French book catalogued by a library in London, for example, can normally only be 
found using subject headings in English, just as a Spanish book catalogued by a 
library in Paris must be searched for using subject headings in French and an 
English book in a library in Madrid would usually be retrieved using subjects in 
Spanish. In a multilingual English/French/Spanish environment, however, we 
need to allow users to search using subjects expressed in any one of those three 
languages and to retrieve all books dealing with that subject. For example, three 
users searching in the library OPAC for information on employment should be able 
to perform a subject search for "employment", "emploi", and "empleo" 
respectively and to retrieve exactly the same documents. When those users 
display their search results, they should see the subject terms in the library 
catalogue record displayed in the language of their choice, e.g. a user searching

for the French term "emploi" should see French headings displayed in the record, 
not "employment" and other subject terms in English or in Spanish. Finally, when 
the library shares its catalogue records with other institutions by exporting them 
to other library catalogues, union catalogues or commercially published 
databases, subject terms in all languages should be available to these other 
systems. These different functions-- search, display and export-- are the basic 
functional requirements for multilingual subject access. 
 
Case study  
 
The Library of the International Labour Organization (ILO) has a long history of 
multilingual support. The ILO, the oldest and one of the largest of the United 
Nations' specialized agencies, has seven official languagesi, of which English, 
French and Spanish are considered working languages. The Library serves a 
worldwide clientele, including the constituents of the organization (the 
governments of 176 member states as well as trade unions and employers' 
organizations); researchers in labour and social issues; and more than 1900 staff 
in headquarters in Geneva Switzerland and in 40 offices around the world. 
Labordoc, the Library's catalogue and bibliographic database, contains over 
350,000 bibliographic records.  Records in Labordoc have been indexed since 
1965 using the ILO Thesaurusii, a multilingual thesaurus in English, French, 
Spanish and German.  
 
From 1980 until late 2002, the ILO Library's catalogue was automated with the 
MINISIS software developed by the International Development Research Centre, 
a Canadian development agency. MINISIS was very suitable for the ILO because 
of its support for searching using a multilingual thesaurus and its ability to call 
user-developed software routines that could extend multilingual support to other 
functions. The multilingual subject access implemented in MINISIS at the ILO was 
based implicitly on the "online processing" model because all processing took 
place at the time the catalogue was accessed. While there are many descriptions 
in the literature of systems that have implemented at least the search 
functionality of this modeliii, the following outline of the way in which this model 
was implemented in the MINISIS software at the ILO is typical. 
 
Online processing model (MINISIS)  
 
In the MINISIS application at the ILO, subject descriptors from the ILO Thesaurus 
were entered in bibliographic records in one language only, Englishiv. The MINISIS 
software validated the descriptor entered against the values for that language in 
the thesaurus authority file. When it came time to search for a subject in the 
OPAC, the MINISIS software recognized that a subject search was called for and 
invoked special query expansion processing. The search term in the query was 
not searched directly in the index; instead it was looked up in the subject 
authority file (thesaurus file) in order to retrieve the equivalent descriptors in all 
the languages of the thesaurus. Each of the different language forms of the 
descriptor (including the original descriptor as entered by the user) were then 
searched separately and the result sets from each search were combined with a 
Boolean OR before the final, combined result set was returned to the user (Fig. 
1)v. Therefore even entering a search strategy in French or Spanish, all 
documents relevant to the concept in Labordoc could be retrieved.

and the number of layers of software on top of the basic database system that 
were required to support MARC records and provide a Web interface made it 
impractical to offer Labordoc to a wide audience over the Internet. 
 
In 1997, the Library began the process of defining user requirements, evaluating 
options, and selecting an integrated library system (ILS) to replace MINISIS. 
Multilingual functionality was just one factor among many governing the choice of 
a system including cost, computer platform, other functional features, openness 
and ease of integration with other ILO systems and longtime viability of the 
vendor. It was clearly not desirable to restrict the choice of a system only to 
those relatively few ILS systems that supported the online processing model for 
multilingual subject access. ILO staff felt, however, that it would be possible to 
provide multilingual subject access using other processing models, and in late 
2001, the ILO selected as its integrated library system Voyager from Endeavor 
Information Systems. Voyager was a relatively new software, although already in 
use in more than 900 libraries around the world. It used Oracle, the ILO's 
database standard as its database engine; it ran on common UNIX platforms; and 
it was developed and supported by a company that was part of the large Reed 
Elsevier publishing group. An especially important factor was that Voyager had a 
very open design, offering prospects for closer integration of the ILS with other 
Oracle information applications being envisaged for the ILO. However while 
Voyager allowed the OPAC user interface to be translated into other languages, 
the system, like a number of other integrated library systems, did not provide 
multilingual subject access using the online processing model described above. 
Therefore one of the challenges of implementing Voyager at the ILO was the 
implementation of a different model for providing multilingual subject access, 
what we call the "pre-processing" model. 
 
Pre-processing model (Voyager) 
 
In the pre-processing model, the online processing required with the previous 
model is traded for offline processing and extra data storage. Instead of having 
software translate descriptors at the moment that subjects are being searched, 
displayed or exported, descriptors are translated in a batch process immediately 
after they have been entered into the bibliographic record, and the equivalent 
descriptors in other languages actually entered into the bibliographic record. Once 
they exist as data in the bibliographic record, normal library system processing 
can be used during the search, display and export of bibliographic records. We 
describe how multilingual subject access with the new Voyager integrated system 
was implemented at the ILO using this pre-processing model. 
 
First, in order to move to the Voyager system, some authority file work was 
required. Previously in the MINISIS system, subject authority records had been 
maintained in a special thesaurus authority file where one record, representing a 
single concept, contained the descriptors in all the different languages. Now 
subject authority records were loaded in Voyager into the standard MARC format 
authority file in the different languages of the thesaurus. A single concept was 
now represented by different subject authority records, each given a different 
code assigned by the Network Standards Office at the Library of Congress to the 
different language versions of the ILO Thesaurus. (For the English language ILO 
Thesaurus, the code is ilot; for the French version entitled Thesaurus du BIT, the 
code is tbit; and for the Spanish version Thesauro de la OIT, the code is toit.)vii. 
While this structure works very well for Voyager purposes, the file structure is not

_________________________________________  
 
easily processed by external programs, so for reasons of convenience, an 
additional table was loaded on the server containing one record for each concept, 
with terms in each of the thesaurus languages.  
 
Once the subject authority file has been prepared, descriptors in English can be 
entered into the appropriate 6xx subject fields in the MARC record (i.e. the $a 
subfield of the 650, 655 or 610 fields) with the appropriate indicators, including 
the indicator for primary or secondary descriptor. This continues the practice the 
ILO had established with the MINISIS system of using English as the language for 
entry and revision of subject descriptions. The ilot code for the English language 
of the ILO Thesaurus is entered into the $2 subfield in each subject field.  When 
the record is saved, the English descriptors in the record are validated against the 
English language subject authority records, and invalid descriptors flagged for 
operator correction, as Voyager would do with any unilingual subject system. 
 
Once the subject description is complete, and has been reviewed if necessary by 
a supervisor, pre-processing for multilingual subject access can take place. An 
automatic batch process is run against all newly catalogued records. It reads from 
each record each English language descriptor in turn, looking up the descriptor 
against the table containing all the thesaurus descriptors in English with their 
equivalent form in French and Spanish. The French and Spanish descriptors are 
then added to new occurrences of the 650, 651 and 655 fields with a value in the 
$2 subfield indicating the language of the thesaurus (or more properly speaking 
the version of the ILO Thesaurus in that language). Finally the updated records 
are written back to the Voyager database, replacing the older version of the 
record. 
 
Figure 2 illustrates this process. If the descriptor "employment" is found in the 
650 field of a newly catalogued record, "employment" is used to search the 
translation table, and retrieve a record where "emploi" and "empleo" are found in 
the French and Spanish fields respectively. "Emploi" is then entered in a new 
occurrence of the 650 field in the MARC bibliographic record with a $2 subfield 
value of tbit and "empleo" is entered into another occurrence of the same field 
with a $2 value of toit.  Similar processing takes place for the other 65X subject 
fields.

Once French and Spanish descriptors are added to the 65X subject fields in the 
MARC record, the French and Spanish descriptors are indexed in the same subject 
index as the English descriptors. The standard Voyager OPAC then allows users to 
do a "subject browse" search, whereby they can display and browse up and down 
lists of headings in alphabetical order, irrespective of the language of the 
heading. The subject browse search also allows OPAC users to look at the full 
subject authority record in a given language, complete with hyperlinked Broader 
Term, Narrower Term and Related Term relationships leading to new lists of 
terms starting with that particular term: this facility provides users with at least a 
limited way to navigate the thesaurus structure in order to discover other terms 
that might improve or expand the original search strategy. Since the thesaurus 
terms in other languages are actually entered in the bibliographic record, they are 
also indexed by Voyager's keyword search engine, and are available for keyword 
searching for a specific field or for general "keyword anywhere" searching with 
relevance ranking. 
 
This addition of equivalent language descriptors to the topic or genre/form 
subject fields of the MARC record is not sufficient in itself to support all the 
requirements for a multilingual OPAC. Assuming an average of 12 descriptors is 
assigned to a bibliographic record, after pre-processing we now have a MARC 
bibliographic record with 36 different occurrences of the subject fields (12 for 
each of the three working languages of the catalogue). Voyager permits selective 
display of fields on the basis of indicator values, but it does not support filtering 
of fields based on a value in a particular subfield in the field (in this case, the 
thesaurus language value in the  $2 subfield). The large number of occurrences of 
the subject fields in all three languages would have rendered displays for the user 
of the library OPAC long, illegible, and full of irrelevant or redundant information. 
 
Therefore another solution had to be found for record display. The solution 
adopted was to copy data into locally defined fields in the record. As descriptors 
are being translated and added to new occurrences of the 655 or 650 fields, they 
are also added to fields in the 900 block, reserved for local use. English 
descriptors for genre/form, primary topical descriptors and secondary topical 
descriptors are added to 900, 905 and 910 fields respectively; French descriptors 
to 901, 906 and 911 fields, and Spanish descriptors to 902, 907 and 912 fields. 
The actual 65X subject fields are never displayed. Instead in the configuration 
files that control record display in the Voyager OPAC, only these local 9xx fields 
are indicated for display so as to restrict the display to one language only. Since 
the display configuration files can be tailored to each individual interface 
language, the display files for the English language version of the OPAC display 
only English language descriptors, the display files for the French language 
version of the OPAC only French descriptors, and similarly for Spanish. 
 
The fact that thesaurus descriptors are now found in locally defined fields in the 
MARC bibliographic record in all languages of the thesaurus as well as in the 6xx 
subject fields also simplifies the export of bibliographic information. No further 
processing is required to share records over the Internet, in union catalogues or 
to supply them to re-publishers of Labordoc on CD-ROM. This feature is 
particularly valuable for the approximately forty ILO external offices located in 
countries around the world, most of which have small local library or publications 
databases. Previously these offices had to wait for records to be specially

processed on export in order for them to be able to copy ILO library cataloguing 
with French or Spanish descriptors into their local catalogue. Now, wherever the 
offices have an Internet connection, these records are available as soon as they 
are processed in Geneva. 
 
The automatic processing of subject terms in newly catalogued records required 
by this pre-processing model has been implemented with a Perl script. The script, 
which has been run daily since October 2002, begins by exporting records from 
Voyager based on the date on which the subject description was completed, 
writing the records to a file on the Sun server on which Voyager runs. The script 
uses the MARC::Record Perl moduleviii to read each record from the file in turn 
and to extract from each record the descriptors entered in English. These 
descriptors are then used to search (via an ODBC connection) an Oracle table 
consisting of English descriptors and their equivalent descriptors in French and 
Spanish. The French and Spanish descriptors are added to the MARC subject 
fields, the descriptors in all languages are added to the MARC local fields, and the 
updated record is written to a second MARC record file on the serverix. This 
second file is used as input into the Voyager bulk import program, where an 
import rule matches the bibliographic record identifier in the record in the import 
file to the bibliographic record identifier in the Voyager database, and 
automatically replaces the latter with the former. The increased size of the 
modified records, and the increased disc space and time required to build index 
files used for retrieval has not proven to be a problem with the robust 
Voyager/Oracle solution. 
 
Conclusion 
 
Each of the two models described here has advantages and disadvantages. The 
pre-processing model requires development of a batch script, and involves a 
significant amount of extra data storage and indexing, though in the current 
information technology environment where hardware costs are low, neither of 
these is a particularly significant constraint. More importantly, it does require 
additional processing when making changes to subject terms, since the batch 
translation process has to be re-invoked when subject terms change. It also 
requires a tighter control over workflows to ensure that records that undergo 
such changes are in fact re-processed. As library collections increase in size to 
over a million records all these factors may begin to take on more importance.  
 
However the pre-processing model also has advantages over the online 
processing model. The fact that records contain distinct locally defined fields for 
different languages make re-use of these records by exchange and database 
publishing partners easier, particularly if the systems in use at those institutions 
do not themselves support the online model of multilingual processing. If library 
systems use add-on keyword retrieval functions which depend on data being 
found in the record itself, the pre-processing model is clearly more effective. The 
most important advantage of the pre-processing model is that it frees small to 
medium-sized multilingual libraries from restricting a choice of an integrated 
library system to just those ILS vendors that support the online processing 
model. Instead of being an essential feature, perhaps imposing less than optimal 
choices in terms of other areas of functionality, multilingual subject support can 
be evaluated in an even-handed way along with all the other considerations that 
go into such a complex and difficult choice.

iii To mention a few examples, the works cited in the bibliography by Chachra, Landry, Lebowitz, 
Michos, Powell, Pollitt and Slater all describe systems based on this model, used either in library 
catalogues or bibliographic databases. 
iv There are in practice two variants of the online processing model: either all documents in the 
database are described in a single language (e.g. all documents have descriptors in English), or 
documents are indexed in the language most appropriate to the language of the document and/or to the 
indexer (e.g. French documents are indexed with French descriptors, Spanish with Spanish and all 
others in English). Because the concepts and the terms in the various languages are defined in the 
multilingual thesaurus, using a single language or any combination of languages for descriptors in the 
bibliographic record is transparent to the end user and indicates in itself no language bias. Cf. 
Soerghel's assertion (1996) that "a cross-language retrieval system with controlled vocabulary must 
support the indexing of documents or other objects-- the assignment of controlled vocabulary 
descriptors-- in the various languages."; this is true only where there is no multilingual display 
capability. 
v With a trilingual thesaurus, and only a single language used for entering descriptors, the search for 
two of the subject terms will of course always result in 0 hits, since these terms do not in fact appear in 
any bibliographic record. However this is irrelevant, since the Boolean OR in the expanded query will 
always result in the complete set of documents representing the concept, regardless of the language of 
the search term entered. 
vi such as the Helecon CD-ROM 
vii This approach is consistent with the recommendations of the MARC Multilingual Record Task 
Force, where cataloguing context is indicated with special coding in a proposed $7 subfield. The 
coding in the ILO Voyager system uses the $2 subfield, but the coding of the language versions of the 
thesaurus is logically equivalent to the an encoding of the ILO Thesaurus as the subject source
