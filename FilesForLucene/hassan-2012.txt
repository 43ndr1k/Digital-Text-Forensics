Abstract. The main goal of authorship attribution is to identify a set of features that remain relatively 
constant among a number of writings by a particular author. Recently, the common n-gram analysis method 
for text classification has been successfully used in automatic authorship attribution. This paper deals with 
text author verification problem using character n-gram information. In addition to usually used total n-gram 
we studied initial, medial and final bi-grams and tri-grams. Experiments show that author profiles generated 
with initial bi-gram and initial tri-gram are effective in verifying texts authors. A threshold in the used 
dissimilarity measure is found for these n-grams that separate dissimilarity of same author texts from texts 
written by different authors. 
Keywords: Author Verification, N-Gram, Dissimilarity Measure 
1. Introduction  
Authorship analysis tries to find out an author writing style which can be used as his “writeprint”. In 
recent years, practical applications for authorship attribution have grown in areas such as intelligence, 
criminal law, civil law, and computer security [1]. 
Stylometry is a linguistic discipline that applies statistical analysis to literary style. It is the basis for 
authorship analysis, which evaluates writing characteristics to make inferences about who wrote it. 
Authorship attribution task is about either identifying the author of a text between a list of candidate authors, 
or verifying if a specific author did or did not write the text. In both cases, one of the main concerns is the 
search for quantifiable features that are able to differentiate between authors. Many types of features have 
been investigated including various measures of vocabulary richness and function word frequencies [2]. 
A promising alternative text representation technique for stylistic purposes makes use of word and/or 
character n-grams. It has been shown that sub-word units as character n-gram can be very effective for 
capturing the nuances of an author’s style. The most frequent n-grams of a text provide important 
information about the author’s stylistic choices on the lexical, syntactical, and structural level [2]. Generating 
n-gram author’s profile has been adopted by several researchers. Keseljet all [3] presented an automated 
Type Style and Fonts authorship attribution based on byte n-gram profiles. Razaet all [4] applied word n-
gram based authorship attribution method to Urdu poetry. Frantzeskouet all [5] presented an approach to 
source code author identification based on byte level n-gram. Tbou-Assalehet all [6] explored the idea of 
automatic n-gram based detection of new malicious Code. Stamatatoset all [7] and Amasyali and Diri [8] 
used character n-gram in text categorization. Stamatatos [9] proposed method for intrinsic plagiarism 
detection using character n-gram profiles. 
In our work we investigate character n-gram based author’s profile. We have studied bi-gram and tri-
gram; then we expanded our studies to initial, medial and final bi-grams and tri-grams which - for our 
knowledge - have not been used so far. In a previous work we focused on the identification process [10]. In 
this paper we are interested in author verification i.e. to define if a specific author did or did not write the text.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II describes our approach. The experimental results 
are included in section III. Finally section IV contains conclusion and future work. 
2. Methodology and the Algorithm  
Our approach is based on character bi-gram and tri-gram. We investigated character n-gram and subsets 
of n-grams; the initial, medial and final n-grams. Digits and punctuation marks are removed. The profile is 
defined as a set of length L of the most frequent n-grams with their normalized frequencies. 
An authorprofile is generated from a training author text. The n-gram profile of the text document to be 
classified (document profile) is compared with the profile of the corresponding author. The comparison is 
performed based on the dissimilarity measure algorithm [3]. In this algorithm, we generate the bi- and tri-
grams from author’s training sample text (author profile). A similar profile is generated for the test data. Let 
f1 (n) be the frequency of the nth bi- or tri-grams in the Author’s Profile. Let f2 (n) be the frequency of the nth 
bi- or tri-grams in the test data. The dissimilarity between the two profiles is calculated using the following 
formula: 
( ) ( )( )21 2n profiles f n f n∈ −∑                                               (1) 
In order to normalize these differences, we divide them by the average frequency for a given n-gram

In the testing phase, first we find out, for each author, the maximum dissimilarity measure between 
testing texts written by him and his profile i.e. author dissimilarity threshold. 
Verification Process: For a new text (new document) the profile is generated and dissimilarity with the 
specific author profile is calculated. If it is less than the author dissimilarity thresholdthen the new text 
belongs to this author. If not, the new text belongs to another author. 
3. Experimental Results  
First Corpus.We considered English data set "A" including four authors: Eva Gale, Ruth Ann Nordin, 
Ross Beckmann, and Payton Lee (Table 1). Authors’ profiles are obtained using training texts. In bi-gram, 
we used profile size L= 50, 100 & 200 and for tri-gram we take profile size of 100, 200, 500 & 700.

Total N-Gram. Results obtained for total bi-gram and tri-gram show that there is no appropriate 
threshold, which can be used to verify the author. Tables 2 and Table 3 show the results for author 
verification using the dissimilarity threshold obtained from testing phase.

Initial N-gram: Table 4 gives the results for testing on initial bigrams. As we can see with profile size 
200 for initial bi-gram the dissimilarity for the same author texts is always less than dissimilarity for different 
authors, which gives a 100% verification ratio. Results for testing on initial trigram (Table 5) show that both 
profiles 200 and 500 can be used to verify the author.

Medial and Final N-grams: The experiments results for medial and final bi-grams (Table 6 and Table 7) 
and for medial and final tri-grams (Table 8 and Table 9) are not encouraging. There are overlaps between the 
dissimilarities for the same author and others. We decided not to perform further experiments on these bi-
grams.

Enlarged Corpus.For moretesting, we enlarged our corpus with other group of authors (Data Set “B”): 
Austin Jane, Dickens Charles, Bronte Anne, and Bronte Charlotte (Table 10). First, we tested the new data 
sets for initial bi-grams and tri-grams. The results are shown in tables 11 and 12.

Then we tested the data set for the eight authors (both data sets A and B combined) only for initial bi- 
and tri-gram only (Tables 13 and 14).

Experiments results are quite good; the initial bi-gram giveshigh verification accuracy with profile size 
200 and so did initial tri-gram with the profile size 200,500 & 700 for all authors. 
4. Summary 
In this paper we presented character n-gram based author verification approach. Total bi-grams and tri-
gram, initial bi-gram and tri-gram, medial and final bi-grams are investigated. Results obtained for total bi-
gram and tri-gram were not encouraging, in opposite to result for initial bi-gram and tri-gram where an 
accurate author verification rates were obtained. For initial bi-gram and tri-gram a threshold is found that 
separate dissimilarity of same author texts from texts written by different authors.  
Initial bi-gram and/or tri-gram can be used for author identification problem i.e. predict the most likely 
author of a text between a predefined set of candidate authors. This will be our future work. In addition, we 
are intending to perform experiments on Arabic language.
