Improving Labbé’s Intertextual Distance: Testing a Revised
Version on a Large Corpus of Italian Literature*

University of Padua, Italy
ABSTRACT
Moving from Labbé’s proposal envisaging the use of intertextual distance to measure the
similarity (and dissimilarity) of texts, this paper proposes a new calculation procedure based
on repeated observations of intertextual distance between pairs of equal-sized text chunks.
The implementation of this procedure on a large corpus including 160 Italian novels pro-
vides information on the values produced by measuring intertextual distance in (both lemma-
tized and non-lemmatized) literary texts written in Italian. In order to show the improvement
achieved through this iterative procedure compared to the original version, distance values
are assessed in terms of their ability to recognize the author as the factor responsible for text
pairing.
INTRODUCTION
This paper is included in the broad research strain aimed at expressing spe-
cific textual features as simple quantitative measures to recognize the degree
of similarity (and dissimilarity) between texts. At least in theory, among
other factors, these measures of similarity are supposed to recognize the
author’s hand; consequently, the problems posed by the development of
procedures for their calculation have often overlapped with the problem of
authorship attribution. However, the very concept of similarity between
texts may involve several dimensions (certainly including many unobserv-
able underlying latent dimensions) of which the author’s individual style is
only one example.

The reduction of the information contained in texts to one single quanti-
tative measure in general and the problem of authorship attribution in par-
ticular are issues that have been widely debated in the relevant literature
and many schools of thought have emerged. Within the humanities (e.g.
history of literature, criticism, stylistics), authorship attribution had been
almost exclusively based on purely qualitative criteria accounting for the
similarity of stylistic choices or recurrent themes and on markedly subjec-
tive procedures (traditional human-expert-based qualitative methods). In
contrast, our research team, including linguists and statisticians, have opted
for quantitative measures deriving from bag-of-words approaches and
unsupervised methods. Statistical analysis of textual data (SADT: Bolasco,
Chiari, & Giuliano, 2010) and text mining approaches (TM: Berry, 2004;
Feldmann & Sanger, 2007) are rich in measures of similarity based on bag-
of-words. In terms of what and how many words should be considered,
proposals range from the inclusion of all tokens included in texts to the
selection of only certain lemmas within certain parts of speech; alternatively,
only high-frequency types may be considered, or forms, compounds and
multi-words belonging to semantic fields selected ad hoc, etc. An interesting
review of such methods was recently conducted by Stamatatos (2009).
The concept of similarity between texts is paramount and depends heav-
ily on how this issue is tackled. Choosing an appropriate similarity measure
is crucial for text clustering, but hundreds of different measures are avail-
able (Rudman, 1998), whereas no measure can be considered best suited for
all applications. A pairwise measure of similarity should mirror the proxim-
ity of two texts but this numeric value depends on the lexical features of
texts and on the measure itself (Tuzzi, 2010; Savoy, 2012).
Of all available measures of similarity, we decided to test the intertextual
distance proposed by Labbé, recently discussed in the Journal of Quantita-
tive Linguistics (C. Labbé & D. Labbé, 2001; D. Labbé, 2007) and also
criticized (Viprey & Ledoux, 2006). Intertextual distance was developed
starting from Muller’s seminal work (Muller, 1968; 1977), also with refer-
ence to the concept of lexical connection (Brunet, 1988; Muller & Brunet,
1988) and it has already been used with corpora in French and English
(Tuzzi, 2012). The present study implements this approach on literary Ital-
ian, i.e. a register that has not yet been analysed (preliminary studies on the
Italian language were conducted with corpora including political and institu-
tional texts (Pauli & Tuzzi, 2009; Tuzzi, Popescu, & Altmann, 2010).
The relevant literature stresses the difficulties emerging when texts of
different length are compared and contrasted; in addition, all the parameters

are well known not to be parameters in the usual statistical sense (quantities
that are fixed and are considered as the “true” value of a variable) because
they are not independent from the dimension N of a text, i.e. its size
expressed as the total number of word-tokens (Tweedie & Baayen, 1998;
Cortelazzo & Tuzzi, 2008; Strauss, Fan, & Altmann, 2008). Intertextual dis-
tance is no exception.
In order to counterbalance the difference in size of the texts being com-
pared and contrasted, we propose a new procedure based on repeated mea-
sures of intertextual distance involving pairs of equal-sized text chunks.
According to the results of the procedure, we suggest typical intertextual
distance values for literary texts written in Italian (with and without lemma-
tization) and stress their advantages.
As shown in the relevant literature, intertextual distance has already
been used to measure the degree of similarity between texts in significant
cases (Merriam, 2003), including the controversial Molière versus
Corneille authorship attribution (Labbé, 2009). We are endeavouring to
decide whether intertextual distance proves useful with Italian novels and if
the author’s style plays a significant role in measuring the similarity
between novels (Cortelazzo, Nadalutti, & Tuzzi, 2012). Since this study is
aimed at testing a method, our corpus is composed of novels whose author-
ship attribution is certain.
THE CORPUS
The corpus includes 160 novels written in Italian and published between
1941 and 2009 collected in a “plain text” file of approximately 75 Mb. The
corpus includes almost 13 million tokens (N = 12,955,825 word-tokens)
and a vocabulary of almost 200,000 types (V = 190,240 form-types). The
V/N Type-Token Ratio amounts to 1.47%, i.e. an average frequency of 68
tokens per form-type. The hapax percentage is 38.01%. All data show that
we are dealing with a large corpus.
To assess the homogeneity of the texts included in the corpus, a number
of criteria come into play and fully satisfactory results are never achieved
(Popescu, Mačutek, & Altmann, 2009). Muller and Brunet (1988) have
drawn a list of the variables contributing to the construction of a text. Even
within a homogenous culture, the author, language, topics and style should
be taken into account. The two factors most difficult to define are language
and style.

As far as language is concerned, one of the tenets of research in linguis-
tics and sociolinguistics is variation. Any natural language is organized
according to an architecture (Coseriu, 1988, pp. 294–296) based on five
dimensions of variation (Coseriu, 1973, pp. 139–144; Berruto, 1987, pp.
19–279): diachronic (the variation deriving from chronological differences),
diatopic (the variation deriving from different geographical settings), diaph-
asic (the variation mirroring differences in the communicative situation),
diastratic (the variation of different social groups), diamesic (the variation
connected to difference in the means of communication: the basic opposi-
tion is between written and oral texts). In its turn, a hard-to-define factor
such as style is included in diaphasic variation and, when literature is
involved, it can effectively boil down to the constraints imposed upon the
author’s creativeness by the literary genre and text structure that have been
chosen. In compiling the 160-novel corpus used for our research, we offset
some of those variables.
In particular, the language variable was offset (all text were originally
written in Italian) and there was a strong reduction of inner variation. Since
it accounts for the text genre, diaphasic variation is neutralized (all texts are
novels) and so are diachronic variation (all novels were written in the 20th
and early 21st century) and diamesic variation (they are all written texts).
Diastratic variation is limited (in terms of both the authors’ social class,
since they were all professional writers, and their target readers: all novels
were written for adult readers). In contrast, diatopic variation is significant
(the authors’ geographical origin plays an important role in Italy, even in
written texts) and the 160 novels included in the corpus deal with a great
number of different topics.
As far as the authors are concerned, the 160 novels were written by 101
different authors: 33 contributed to the corpus with more than one work
(totalling 92 novels) and 68 with only one novel. Appendix 1 provides the
full list of the novels with their authors, titles and years of publication.
The corpus was lemmatized through an automatic lemmatization pro-
gram called TreeTagger (Schmid, 1994). TreeTagger is a tool for annotating
texts with part-of-speech and lemma information. It was developed by Hel-
mut Schmid in the TC project at the Institute for Computational Linguistics
of the University of Stuttgart.
As in many other inflectional languages, words in Italian have different
morphological forms obtained by changing their suffixes. Different forms
are used to express morphological attributes such as case, number and gen-
der. Lemmatization in Italian texts should overcome the limits set by the
128 M.A. CORTELAZZO ET AL.

contingent nature of several lexical choices (e.g. tenses) and variants: mas-
culine and feminine forms in both singular and plural variants; three per-
sons (first, second, third) and two numbers. We are perfectly aware that
automatic lemmatization does not ensure fully reliable results and – most
importantly – any corpus can be lemmatized according to several different
principles and theories. With a view to the specific objective of our study
(testing Labbé’s intertextual distance) and in the light of the large corpus
involved, we resorted to the solution provided by TreeTagger thanks to a
basic lemmatization process associating each form-type with a pair includ-
ing a lemma-type and a grammatical category.
INTERTEXTUAL DISTANCE
A set of simple indicators of presence, absence and, more generally, fre-
quency of word-types (form-types or lemma-types) is the base of most bag-
of-words approaches. Intertextual distance is based on a sum of differences
between the frequencies of words in two texts.1
Given a pair of texts A and B of size NA and NB with NA 6 NB, the fre-
quency fi;B of each word-type i in the larger text B is reduced (f i;B) accord-
ing to the size of the shorter text A by means of a simple proportion
f i;B ¼ fi;B
NA
NB
:
The distance d between A and B is:
dðA;BÞ ¼
P
i2VA[B jfi;A  f i;Bj
2NA
where VA[B represents the vocabulary of A and B, i.e. all word-types (or
lemma-types) occurring in at least one of the two texts. The distance d sat-
isfies the following properties:
(1) Non-negativity dðA;BÞ  0: the distance is a positive number within
the [0,1] interval; if two texts have no words in common, they are
separated by a distance amounting to one (maximum theoretical
distance).

(2) Identity dðA;AÞ ¼ 0: the distance between a text and itself amounts
to zero and, more generally, if two texts contain the same words with
the same frequency their distance amounts to zero (identity of indis-
cernibles).
(3) Symmetry dðA;BÞ ¼ dðB;AÞ: the distance between A and B is the
same as the distance between B and A.
(4) Triangle inequality dðA;BÞ 6 dðA;CÞ þ dðB;CÞ: the distance
between A and B is smaller than the sum of their distances from a
third text C.
Some examples based on simple and short nursery rhymes may prove
useful. The following two texts have the same size (NA ¼ NB ¼ 16) and
contain the same words in a different order:
Text A: a wise old owl lived in an oak, the more he saw the less he
spoke
Text B: in an oak a wise old owl lived, the less he spoke the more he
saw
The intertextual distance d between A and B is equal to zero (identity of
indiscernibles):
dðA;BÞ ¼ 0
32
If we take into account another text C of the same size NC = 16:
Text C: I am a teapot short and stout, this is my handle and this is my
spout
and calculate the intertextual distance between A and C we obtain a dis-
tance close to one (maximum theoretical distance) because the two texts
hardly have words in common (only the article a with same frequency):

then the distance d between A and D is:
dðA;DÞ ¼ 28:00
32
¼ 0:88
and we obtain again a distance close to one because the two texts have in
common only the article the (but with different frequencies).
Finally, if we take into account a text E of size NE = 20 that is obtained
pooling together a chunk from text A and one from text D:
Text E: a wise old owl lived in an oak, rain on the tree, rain on the
rooftops but not on me
and reduce its frequencies f i;R ¼ fi;E1620, we obtain:
dðA;DÞ ¼ 16:00
32
¼ 0:50
Table 1 reports the frequencies involved in the calculations.
A REVISED METHOD
In the formula proposed by Labbé, the frequencies of words in the larger
text are reduced proportionally to the size of the smaller text but, although
a correction is envisaged (i.e. f i;B) to make the frequencies in both texts
mutually comparable, intertextual distance is not independent from the size
of the texts under scrutiny.
To counterbalance the effect of the size of the two texts being compared,
we propose a method for calculating intertextual distance that, rather than
making the texts mutually comparable by correcting frequencies, resorts to
repeated measures of intertextual distance obtained from text chunks of the
same size.
Given p novels, we start with a 2D matrix of dimensions ðp pÞ where
the generic element dij is the distance calculated for a pair of novels ði; jÞ
where i; j ¼ 1 . . . p. This matrix only accounts for pðp 1Þ=2 non-identical
non-redundant pairs (since 8i; j dij ¼ dji and dii ¼ 0,).
The size n of text chunks and the number m of iterations (number of
samples) are established ex ante. For each iteration k ¼ 1 . . .m, a sample is
extracted including p text chunks of size n, i.e. one for each novel. Based

on those p text chunks, a 2D matrix of distances is calculated, including the
intertextual distances for all pairs of text chunks at iteration k.
Since all text chunks share the same size n, for the purpose of calculat-
ing the intertextual distance the estimated frequency f i;B is useless and the
formula to calculate the distance of the A and B text-chunks pair can be
simplified as:
dðA;BÞ ¼
P
i2VA[B j fi;A  fi;Bj
NA þ NB ¼
P
i2VA[B j fi;A  fi;Bj
2n
:
After m iterations, a 3D matrix of dimensions ðp p mÞ with the generic
element dijk is obtained. Non-identical non-redundant pairs to be considered
amount to mpðp 1Þ=2. The distances observed are hypothetically distrib-
uted according to a normal distribution Nðl;rÞ which is known to be
dependent on the size n of text chunks but, thanks to the procedure imple-
mented, it is independent from the size of novels. Starting from the 3D
matrix of distances, a 2D matrix is calculated where the generic element is
calculated as the mean out of m iterations:
d̂ij ¼
Pm

and is assumed as the estimated distance for the pair of novels i, j with size
n samples. The overall mean value:
d̂ ¼
P
ijk dijk
mpðp 1Þ=2
is the estimated value of l and may be considered as the reference value
for the intertextual distance of Italian novels of size n.
The calculation was repeated twice:
(1) with types (non-lemmatized corpus);
(2) with lemmas (lemmatized corpus).
Moreover, in presenting results, two cases were distinguished:
(1) Distances calculated by considering the 160 novels as a whole, i.e.
their authors were not considered (12,720 pairs).
(2) Distances calculated for pairs including novels written by the same
author (124 pairs) and pairs of novels written by different authors
(12,596 pairs).

All statistical calculations were made by means of the R software (R Devel-
opment Core Team, 2011), a popular language and environment for statisti-
cal computing available as free software under the terms of the Free
Software Foundation’s GNU General Public License in source code form.
RESULTS
Starting from p = 160 novels, the procedure was implemented four times
by extracting text chunks of size n respectively amounting to: 5000;
10,000; 15,000; 20,000 word-tokens (m = 200 word-chunks were extracted
each time).
A large number of pairs are used to calculate intertextual distance: each
iteration involves (160 159)/2 = 12,720 pairs of different novels;
consequently, by extracting 200 word chunks, 200 12; 720 ¼ 2; 544; 000
observations of the intertextual distance are obtained. With 15,000 and
20,000-word token samples, the number of novels is decreased by three,
since Cardarelli (1948), D’Arzo (1953) and Tabucchi (1984) have to be
excluded since they are shorter than 20,000 tokens.
Figure 1 shows the distribution of intertextual distance values without
the sampling procedure (12,720 pairs of whole novels) and the distribution
of the average intertextual distance values obtained through the sampling
procedure (text chunks of 5000; 10,000; 15,000; 20,000 word-tokens) in the
case of the non-lemmatized corpus, i.e. calculations based on form-type
frequencies. Figure 2 shows the distribution after calculations based on
lemma-types.

As expected, the intertextual distance value decreases as the text-chunk
size decreases. Moreover, if no sampling procedure is implemented and the
distance is calculated for pairs of novels of different sizes (continuous line),
the distribution is more varied and less regular. On average, the values
obtained through the calculation based on lemma-types are lower than the
values accounting for form-types (all distributions shift towards lower
values).
An interesting finding emerges if the pairs of novels written by the same
author (124 pairs represented in a histogram) are distinguished from the
pairs of novels written by different authors (curve). The distribution shows

begin to diverge and their distance increases as the size of the samples
increases (Figure 4).
This finding is particularly interesting because the distance values
obtained with the sampling procedure seem to prove more effective in
detecting the similarity between novels deriving from the author’s hand.
Moreover, those pairs of novels emerge as attributable to a “different”
population. Finally, the sampling technique clearly ensures more stable and
normal measures, since their distribution is more regular.
Similar results are obtained through calculations bases on lemma-types
(Figures 5 and 6).
EVALUATION OF RESULTS
The intertextual distances provided information on similarities and differ-
ences between all pairs of novels. If intertextual distance were capable of
recognizing the distinctive and consistent lexical features of authors, we
would expect the novels written by the same author to be more similar to
each other than the novels written by different authors. Our hypothesis is
that the author may be considered as a primary element to assess the
n = 5,000 n = 10,000 
n = 15,000 n = 20,000

similarity between two novels (although we are aware that this is not
always the case and the author is not the only factor coming into play).
From the overall corpus, 33 authors were selected who contributed with
more than one novel to our corpus, totalling 92 novels: Ammaniti (4),
Arbasino (3), Baricco (3), Berto (2), Bevilacqua (2), Bufalino (2), Buticchi
(5), Calvino (8), Chiara (2), Eco (2), Faletti (4), Fenoglio (2), Levi C. (2),
Levi P. (4), Magris (2), Maraini (3), Mazzantini (2), Morante (3), Moravia
(4), Ortese (2), Parise (2), Pasolini (2), Pavese (2), Piovene (2), Pratolini
(2), Rigoni Stern (2), Romano (2), Sciascia (3), Tabucchi (3), Tamaro (3),
Veronesi (2), Vittorini (2), Volponi (4).
If the data included in the matrix of distances are considered along with
the submatrix of distances involving those 92 novels, each novel may be
taken as a reference point to rank all the others, from the closest to the
furthest. The configuration of the 92 ranks may give an idea of how useful
intertextual distance can be in recognizing novels written by the same
author.
For each one of the 92 novels we checked the position in the distance
ranks of the other novels written by the same author.
Suppose that p + 1 novels were written by the same author. Ideally, if
one of those novels is considered, intertextual distance should place the
other p in the first p positions of the ranking. If all novels produce this
result, all p(p  1) comparisons lead to ranks k between 1 and p. If novels
are positioned further from the first p positions, this means that intertextual
distance is incapable of effectively accounting for the author’s influence.
Take a simple case, like Giorgio Faletti. The corpus includes four novels
written by him within a short time span (2002–2009) and dealing with simi-
lar topics (they are all crime novels). An excerpt from the rankings (first ten
positions) associated with the four novels by Faletti obtained by ranking
intertextual distances (10,000 tokens samples and calculations based on
form-types) is shown in Table 2.

The rankings relating to the four novels by Faletti always place the other
three novels in the first three positions; therefore, given the position k of his
novels in the rankings, intertextual distance works perfectly in all 12 com-
parisons (Table 3).
The situation is rather more complex in the case of a multi-faceted
author with a longer artistic career like Italo Calvino: our corpus includes
eight of his novels, written in the course of a 30-year period (1947–1979).
An excerpt from the rankings (first 40 positions) associated with the eight
novels by Calvino obtained by ranking intertextual distances (10,000 token
samples and calculations based on form-types) is shown in Table 4. Notice
that none of Calvino’s works leads to a ranking in which the other seven
novels are in the first seven positions. The summary of all 56 possible com-
parisons is shown in Table 5.
The novels written in 1947 (Il sentiero dei nidi di ragno), 1979 (Se una
notte d'inverno un viaggiatore) and, partly, 1972 (Le città invisibili) seem to

differ from the others. A comparison with the results of traditional stylistic
criticism could explain those differences.
Table 6 shows the overall data for all novels and authors with calcula-
tions based on form-types. The results are subdivided according to different
parameterizations of the intertextual distance calculation procedure and in
the case of a basic implementation of intertextual distance (no sampling).
Table 7 shows the same results with calculations based on lemma-types. To
ensure homogenous comparisons, Tabucchi’s novel was discarded since it is
shorter than 20,000 word tokens.
DISCUSSION
By drawing inspiration from the proposals put forward by Labbé and Labbé
(2001) for the French language, we focused on the values liable to be appli-
cable to modern Italian literature. Consistently with the approach envisaging
repeated measures of the distance of equal-sized samples, we propose refer-
ence values applicable to literary Italian for a given text size, i.e. the size of
the text chunks extracted during the sampling procedure. Table 8 shows the

types.

mean values of intertextual distance calculated for form-types for all pairs
of novels under scrutiny; Table 10 shows the values obtained by distin-
guishing the pairs including novels written by the same author from the
pairs including novels written by different authors. Tables 9 and 11 report
the values calculated with reference to lemma-types.
If a pair of novels of approximately the same length is considered, the
hypothesis may be put forward that the mean distance equals the value d̂
and quantiles may be used to understand whether it is positioned within an
acceptable range. For instance, in the case of two lemmatized texts of
approximately 10,000 words in length, an intertextual distance may be
expected of approximately 0.425 and values smaller than 0.359 or greater
than 0.490 may be considered extreme.
Our analysis shows that such reference values may need to be refined if
novels written by the same author are compared. If two lemmatized texts of
10,000 words in length are compared, a distance of 0.310 may be accept-
able for novels written by the same author but it becomes suspicious if dif-
ferent authors are the case.

In assessing the role played by authors, the procedure based on sampling
improves the performance of intertextual distance and much more so with
larger samples. The procedure based on sampling contributes to the stability
of intertextual distance between two texts and to the reliability of estimated
similarity measures between texts, which translates into more effective dis-
crimination. Although the idea upon which the concept of intertextual dis-
tance is based is very simple, this value proves very effective in
recognizing the proximity of novels written by the same author. However,
no results are obtained capable of distinguishing reliably between novels
written by the same author and novels written by different authors. We are
still far from a simple test that – given two texts – can prove whether they
were written by different authors or by the same person.
CONCLUSIONS
Intertextual distance testing procedures should be further developed by
keeping under control variables related to language variation (be it dia-

chronic, diatopic, diaphasic, diastratic, diamesic) or other variables partly
corresponding to those reported by Muller and Brunet (1988), i.e. in
addition to the author, language, topics and style. Those factors should be
analysed in detail by using ad hoc corpora: the very corpus used for the
present study can prove useful in investigating the effect of diatopic varia-
tion and the different topics dealt with in the novels.
Additional evidence of those factors may emerge from the misclassified
authorship attributions. There are authors who wrote novels which are clas-
sified far apart from each other despite the fact that they were written by
the same hand. Obviously there are a number of factors contributing to that
dissimilarity and each case should be analysed individually. Consequently,
we believe that testing the approach to intertextual distance proposed by
Labbé and implementing the text sampling procedure proposed in this paper
may prove fruitful.
