PLM2009 Abstract – http://ifa.amu.edu.pl/plm/ 
Variety of linguistic parameters of the Estonian text-types 
Krista Kerge (Tallinn University) and Hille Pajupuu (Institute of the Estonian Language) 
Our goal is to describe natural models of language use to be applied in language teaching and testing 
of both L1 (mother tongue curriculum, state maturation exams) and L2 (Estonian as a second language 
curriculum, state exams for students and adults). Arguing with the common in Estonia practice of 
equalizing natural and normative (standard) language, we consider natural anything widely acceptable 
in the field in our cultural context (cf. Hayes et al. 1980). This principal has to be considered by any 
high-stakes tests (Abu-Alhija 2007; Shohamy 2001). 
For this study, text-types are register-dependable artefacts of different genres in certain field of 
communication (journalistic, academic, fiction, legal, administrational, personal, etc.; cf. Gee 2008). 
Using a variety of methods of text and discourse analysis, we have studied linguistic parameters of 
oral and written text-types, both monologue and dialogue: e.g. Kerge 2003 on syntactic complicacy 
(corpus studies, Michos et al. 1996; fuzzy analysis, Meier 2002); Pajupuu et al. 2008 on lexical 
richness (Uber-index, Vermeer 2000); Kerge et al. on 2007 contextuality–formality depending on the 
balance of parts of speech (F-index, Heylighen and Dewaele 2002), etc. 
Our results show reliable variety by field and genre. Complicacy of written texts seems to relay e.g. on 
ideology. Formality is clearly growing from oral to written and from dialogue to monologue. Among 
written types of text studied, the legal ones are the most complex in their syntax; unexpectedly, the 
most formal texts in Estonian are these of administration (letters between public officers and letters 
from them to citizens). Lexical richness seems to be less important than vocabulary range. The most 
important factor of managing the topic is vocabulary range (e.g. 20% of all words belonging to 
thematic vocabulary of very low frequency). 
In our presentation, also some obvious conclusions for linguistic research and applied linguistics 
(especially language testing) will be made.
