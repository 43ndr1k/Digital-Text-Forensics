This article examines whether Sister Nivedita (1867–
1911) played any role in the writing of the articles and
books by J. C. Bose (1858–1937), an Indian scientist,
during their long period of association (1898–1911).
Here, the writings of J.C. Bose are studied from this
perspective. It may be noted that the relation between
Bose and Nivedita was personal in nature. Three
important style markers—function words, punctuation
marks, and usage of words are used to trace the
changes in Bose’s writing style, if any. The results
show that during the association between Bose and
Nivedita, Bose’s style of writing changed considerably
in comparison to the earlier period when they did not
know each other. It shows Nivedita helped Bose in pre-
paring his journal articles and books. The results
reveal a distinct change in Bose’s writing style after his
meeting with Nivedita. This is reflected in his changing
pattern of usage of these three stylistic features. Bose
slowly moved back towards his original style of writing
after Nivedita’s death, but his later works still carried
Nivedita’s influence.
Introduction
Authorship attribution studies have a long history. It
probably begins with the scholar librarians of the Library of
Alexandria (Love, 2002). From Shakespeare to Jagadis
Chandra Bose (J.C. Bose) (1858–1937) this issue continues
to be a matter of discussion in some quarters. Authorship
identification endeavors to find out who is the real or most
probable author of the text(s) (Stamatatos, 2008).
Attributing authorship is done through qualitative and
quantitative means, such as looking at the word distribu-
tion or by doing content analysis of their works. The
process is one of examining texts to mark out underlying
characteristics to ascertain authorship. In authorship iden-
tification, the likelihood of authorship of a particular text
can be checked by comparing it with the other clearly
known writings of the same author. Few studies have been
conducted on the writings of scientists. There is a long-
standing controversy (Atmaprana, 1961; Basu, 1990;
Dasgupta, 1999; Foxe, 1975; Muktiprana, 1959; Nivedita,
1982; Reymond, 1953) on whether Sister Nivedita (origi-
nal name: Margaret Elizabeth Noble) (1867–1911) wrote
or edited Bose’s manuscripts during their long period of
association (1898–1911).
Background
J. C. Bose was born in the town of Mymensingh, which
was part of undivided Bengal (now in Bangladesh) on 30th
November 1858. In 1877 and 1880, he passed F.A. (First
Arts) and B.A. (Science) examinations, respectively, both in
second division at the University of Calcutta (Roy et al.,
1963). In 1880, He went to England to study and joined
Christ’s College, University of Cambridge (Dasgupta,
1999). He graduated (with a BA) in the natural science
tripos in 1884 (Peile, 1913). He also received a BSc
(Honors) degree in 1883 from the University of London.
Later he received a DSc in experimental physics from Uni-
versity of London in 1896 (University of London General
Register).
He returned to India in 1885 and joined Presidency
College (Dasgupta, 1999) as a teacher. Bose’s scientific
research may be divided into three different phases. The
first phase consisted of 6 years (1895–1901); the second

phase 2 years (1901–1902), and the last, that is, third phase
25 years (1902–1927). His research areas included short
electromagnetic waves, their optical properties, and devel-
oping compact apparatus to study the properties of these
waves; the behavior of plant tissues under different types of
stimulation with the aim of showing similarity in its
responses with that of non-living entities under same type of
circumstances, and physiological activities of plants
(Dasgupta, 2011; Roy, Bhattacharya, Mitra, Guha Thakurta,
& Datta, 1963). He was a pioneer in developing the
“mercury coherer with a telephone” which was later
used by Marconi in wireless radio signal transmission
(Bondyopadhyay, 1998). He was the third Indian to be
elected as a fellow of the Royal Society in 1920 (Dasgupta,
1999).
Sister Nivedita was born in Ireland to Samuel Richmond
Noble and Mary Isabel Hamilton. Along with her sister,
she was admitted to the Halifax school in 1877. After
completing her school education in 1884, she left for Case-
wick to work as a teacher at a private boarding school for
girls. After that, she worked in some other schools until
1892, when she opened her own school. Among science
subjects, she studied “botany, physics and the rudiments of
mechanics” (Reymond, 1953, p. 17; Muktiprana, 1959, p.
7). Therefore, it may be said that her knowledge of science
was limited to what she learned in school. With the lofty
ideals of her father in her heart, she met Swami Viveka-
nanda (1863–1902), the famous Indian monk, during one of
his lectures in London in 1895. She was immediately
attracted to Swamiji. She came to India in 1898 and joined
Vivekananda’s work. Convinced of her dedication for the
betterment of Indian people, Swami Vivekananda initiated
her into the Brahmacharya life on March, 29th 1898. He
gave her the name “Nivedita”—“she who had been dedi-
cated” (Reymond, 1953, p. 86). After reaching Kolkata
(then Calcutta), Nivedita came to know about Bose from his
local acquaintances. Nivedita met Bose in 1898 (Nivedita’s
letter to Tagore on 04.18.1903). Swami Vivekananda did not
play any role in the personal relationship between Bose and
Nivedita. But, as he was very proud of Bose and his work as
an Indian scientist (Vivekananda, 1907), he did not discour-
age Nivedita’s relationship with Bose either. Bose was
encountering problems with his research at Presidency
College. Nivedita wanted to help Bose so that he could
realize his full potential as a scientist. It should be noted
here that their relationship was personal in nature and that
she volunteered to help him with his writings. Nivedita was
not paid for this (Reymond, 1953). The history of science
and technology is full of assistance by “invisible techni-
cians” who support scientists or technologists with their
research (Shapin, 1989; Gay, 2008). Likewise, Nivedita
played her part to help Bose communicate his research to
the world scientific community, without monetary gain. And
what unites Nivedita with other “invisible technicians” is
that like them, she also remained invisible to world science,
as Bose never acknowledged her in any of his scholarly
works.
However, it is interesting to note that the biographer of
Bose (Dasgupta, 1999) did not dwell on this matter, whereas
the biographers of Nivedita (Atmaprana, 1961; Basu, 1990;
Foxe, 1975; Muktiprana, 1959; Reymond, 1953) gave
prominence to this issue. According to Reymond (1953)
“They had actually written the book, Plant Response,
together” (p. 312). Muktiprana (1959) claimed Bose’s
famous book Plant Response and other later books display
Nivedita’s writing style. Atmaprana (1961) claimed
Nivedita helped/edited several of Bose’s books. Foxe (1975)
mentioned that Nivedita “helped Dr Bose in writing his book
Comparative Electro-Physiology” (p. 189). She also added
that Nivedita “did not claim to know very much” about
science “and so accepted Dr. Bose’s theories and research
without too much query” (p. 197). But the most vocal of
them all is Basu (1990). Basu (1990) accepted the fact that
Bose did not mention any help given by Nivedita in writing
his books. Basu (1990) calculated that the number of pages
of the first four books is around 2,500. He also claimed
Nivedita prepared these pages by herself! Bose’s authorized
biographer (Geddes, 1920) did not mention it at all, nor did
his other biographers (Home, 1958; Roy et al., 1963; Saha,
1940). However, one of his biographers (Dasgupta, 1999)
mentioned the issue of authorship briefly. According to
Dasgupta, Nivedita functioned “as his secretarial and edito-
rial assistant” (p. 162).
In her letters, Nivedita herself hinted at her help with
Bose’s writings. The main source of Nivedita’s comments
on her help with Bose’s writings are her letters (Nivedita,
1982). Nivedita mentioned her help, assistance or associa-
tion with Bose’s works in about 29 letters she wrote to
various people. Among these, 14 letters were written to
Miss. J. MacLeod. Mrs. Ole Bull received 12 letters. In two
cases, we cannot not find the recipient’s name. Another
letter was sent to Miss. Alice M. Longfellow, daughter of the
famous American poet, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow
(1807–1882). Miss Longfellow was Mrs. Bull’s sister-in-
law (Nivedita, 1982).
Bose, on the other hand, did not mention it very clearly in
any of his writings, except in one of his letters to Nivedita’s
sister written on 11.02.1911 (Letter Number 79; Appendix
1911) (Nivedita, 1982). However, it should be noted that he
wrote this letter after Nivedita’s death. Nobel Laureate
Rabindranath Tagore (1861–1941) was a close friend of
Bose. Although some remain missing, 124 letters have been
found, which were exchanged between them: Bose wrote 88
and Tagore wrote 36. However, we do not find any clear
mention of Nivedita’s help in Bose’s writings in any of
Tagore’s letters. Only in his obituary on Bose, did Tagore
mention Nivedita as an “inspiress” in Bose’s life and works.
He added Nivedita should be remembered with reverence
when discussing Bose’s life (Tagore, 1937). In one such
letter (Bose, 1994) to Tagore (July 20, 1901), Bose men-
tioned his “English Assistant.” However, did not mention
that this “English Assistant” was Nivedita. From his biogra-
phies (Roy et al., 1963; Dasgupta, 1999), we do not come
across any other English (Irish) lady with whom Bose was

acquainted. From this, we may infer that Bose was referring
to Nivedita in his letter to Tagore. However, unlike Nivedita,
Bose never mentioned the exact role Nivedita played in
preparing his scientific articles and books, and surely never
recognized her as his coauthor. Although there be is a lack of
clarity on exactly what role Nivedita played in Bose’s pub-
lications, it can be said that she was of some assistance to his
writings.
Objectives
The primary objective of this work is to find out whether
Bose’s style of writing underwent any change during the
period of his association with Sister Nivedita. The other
objectives of this work are to trace the different patterns of
Bose’s style of writing in three different phases: first phase,
before Bose met Nivedita (1895–1899); second phase,
during their association (1900–1913); and third phase, after
the death of Nivedita (1914–1937); and more specifically to
find out the similarities and dissimilarities between the
writings of these three phases, which may help determine
whether or not Nivedita helped him to prepare his scientific
writings.
Preparation of the Sample
Journal articles and books written by Bose were the
sample in this study. Before Bose met Nivedita, he wrote
only journal articles. During the period of their association,
Bose produced both journal articles and books. However,
during this period, he received more accolades and promi-
nence for his books. Based on the success of his books, the
help rendered by Sister Nivedita is claimed in much clearer
terms (Basu, 1990). It should be noted that editorial assis-
tance rendered in preparing a book is much more discern-
ible than a journal article. After Sister Nivedita’s death, he
produced both books and journal articles. The best source
for the journal articles written by Bose is Acharya J.C.
Bose, a scientist and a dreamer (1996). All the books
written by Bose are now freely available on the Internet
except, Motor Mechanism of Plants (1928). For our analy-
sis, we downloaded many of Bose’s books from the
Internet.
To find out whether Nivedita did indeed help Bose with
his writings, it was necessary to select and analyze texts
written by Bose from all three phases. It should be men-
tioned here that Bose met Nivedita in 1898. To do this work,
his writings have been categorized in three distinct phases.
The first category comprises the set of publications Bose
wrote before Nivedita entered into his life (1895–1899); the
second category is the set of writings produced during
their period of association (1900–1913). Though Nivedita
died in 1911, the mention of Bose’s book is found in her
letters which were not published till 1913; and the last cat-
egory includes the set of writings produced during 1914–
1937.
A list of 122 scholarly articles written by Bose was
obtained from the book on Bose (Bose, 1996). In addition,
he wrote 11 monographs. Bose published 14 articles in the
first phase, 11 articles and four books in the second phase,
and 97 articles and seven books in the last phase. For this
work, 44 samples of 800 words each were randomly
selected from Bose’s writings spanning these three phases.
It should be noted here that though Bengali was Bose’s
native language, he used English for writing articles and
books. Hence, all the samples used here were written in
English. And, Bose and Nivedita communicated with each
other in English only. One may question why only sample
containing 800 words were chosen. To get a better result,
samples were taken from different parts of the book, for
example, the preface, initial chapters, middle chapters, and
end chapters. Because it is probable that in scientific writing
different parts of a paper or a book may contain different
styles of presentation according to the topic under discus-
sion, the first 800 words of any article or book chapter were
selected. However, in case of two books from our samples,
that is, Response in Living and Non-Living pertaining to
second phase, and The Physiology of the Ascent of Sap
pertaining to third phase, the respective prefaces could not
be used. The reasons being that the preface of the first one
was just a list of documents that helped Bose write the first
book, and the size of the preface is less than 800 words. In
rest of the books, the size of the preface is 800 words or
more. Hence, it was decided to select samples of 800 words
from each of the sample texts. From the first phase, six
articles were selected, from the second one, eight
samples—four from journals and the rest from different
books, and 30 samples from the third phase—19 from
articles and rest from books. Questions may also arise
because of the use of more articles than parts of books. It
should be noted that the format of texts are of more impor-
tance in the literary arena, such as the poem, novel, essay
etc. But, in science, the only format used for communica-
tion is the essay. In the case of articles, samples are short
essays, whereas for books, samples are longer essays. The
only difference is in number of words and therefore the
length of the texts. In these cases, the use of function words
and punctuation marks may not be different. It may also be
noted that function words are both topic-independent and
context-free (Stamatatos, 2009). However, it should also be
noted that from the first milestone in scholarly communica-
tion of science, that is, the publication of Journal des
Scavans (January, 1665) to date, the process of information
transfer in scholarly communication in the field of science
has undergone a number of changes (Meadows, 1974;
Garvey, 1979; Subramanyam, 1979). And the prime genre
in this communication process, the ubiquitous “article” has
also under gone several changes during this long journey
(Bazerman, 1988).
Two important style markers, namely, function words,
and punctuation marks have been used for the study. Later
his usage of words except scientific terms in his writings was
examined in this work. The importance of function words in

the authorship attribution test, pioneered by Mosteller and
Wallace (1964), has been underlined in various papers
(Argamon & Levitan, 2005; Koppel, Schlier, & Argamon,
2009; Miranda García & Calle Martín, 2007; Stamatatos,
2009; Zhao & Zobel, 2005). Punctuation marks were used
as the second style marker in the study. The history of
punctuation marks as a style marker used to decipher author-
ship of a text is a long one. Possibly Mascol (1888a, 1888b)
first used this method in 1888. Other investigators have
tested its usefulness (Chaski, 2001; Mingzhe & Jiang, 2012;
O’Donnell, 1966). Zipf (1949) first drew attention to the
importance of the psychology of word usage.
Methods
Sixteen most frequently used function words were taken
for analyzing the samples. The function words are: the, of,
in, to, a, and, by, that, be, it, with, as, this, which, for, and on.
These words were included along with their frequency in the
respective 44 texts (marked as JCB1, JCB2 . . .) in a work-
book. Later, a program was written for the chi-square test in
Matlab® and the workbook was imported for calculation.
The calculation was aimed at checking the similarity and
dissimilarity among and between the different text samples.
The chi-square values (χ2) and the corresponding p values
were calculated. The null hypothesis (H0) for the study was
“from same group” and if p value is less than 0.05 the null
hypothesis was rejected at 95% level of significance. Then
the result was analyzed.
The four most frequently used punctuation marks by
Bose were taken into account; these are period (.), comma
(,), semicolon (;), and hyphen (-). The same procedure was
followed for punctuation marks as for function words, as
well. The data on the usage of these four punctuation marks
in our sample of 44 texts were collected and the chi-square
values (χ2) and the corresponding p values for all the
samples were calculated. Here, the same hypothesis and
criteria mentioned earlier were followed.
Using Zipf’s first law (r * f = C where “r is the rank of the
word-type, f is the number of times it occurs, and C is a
constant related to sample size”) (De Bellis, 2009), we
enlisted the words used by Bose in the three phases. Then,
the words that were newly introduced in the second phase
and continued to be used in the third phase as well. His
tendency to use different forms of the same word (synony-
mous words) was also analyzed.
Findings
As there were 44 files to be compared with each other
for finding similarities or dissimilarities between and
among themselves, the calculation showed 44C2 = 946
results. Here JCB1 through JCB6 were text samples that
were written by Bose in the first phase, JCB7 through
JCB14 during their association, and JCB15 through JCB44
during the absence of Nivedita. The results of the calcula-
tion are as follows.
Function Words
From the first row of Table 1, it is clear that the sample
texts from first phase were matching to a high degree based
on the pattern of function words usage. As Bose did not meet
Nivedita during this time, it may be concluded that Bose
himself was the author of these texts.
However, in the second row, there is a visible change in
the use of function words by Bose during his association
with Nivedita. There is a mismatch in the writings of the two
phases. From this, it may be inferred that Nivedita’s influ-
ence is present in Bose’s style of writing.
The texts written during the first phase (row 1) and during
second phase (row 3) show a great similarity. However, the
percentage of “Matching” has come down in the second
phase. Perhaps the texts of this period carried the literary
fingerprint of Bose and Nivedita, unlike the first period when
Bose prepared all his writings himself.
Row 4 presents an interesting picture. By mere percent-
age, it shows there are dissimilarities between the texts com-
posed during their association and after Nivedita’s death.
However, the narrow gap between “Matching” and “Not
Matching” underlines the fact that Nivedita left an indelible
mark on Bose’s style of writing.
Just like the previous results, the data in the fifth row
show Nivedita’s influence on Bose’s style of writing. It
resulted in a slightly higher percentage for “Not Matching”
category for the texts produced between these two periods.

Third phase JCB15—JCB44 50 50 Similar
648 JOURNAL OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR INFORMATION SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY—March 2015
DOI: 10.1002/asi
At the same time, from this narrow difference it may be
concluded that Bose’s writings started to show signs of
reverting to his former style of writing, seen during the first
phase (JCB1—JCB6).
Like the results shown in the fourth and fifth rows, the
results of the last row are revealing. The rows (4, 5, and 6)
are in the same category. The data in these rows show that
Bose was in a transformation phase, slowly returning back
to his own writing style (as reflected in row 5) although not
able to completely expunge the influence of Nivedita.
Punctuation Marks
From Table 2, Nivedita’s influence on Bose’s writing is
more discernible. It clearly shows the internal similarity
among the writings of the first phase (when Bose wrote
alone); last phase (after Nivedita’s absence), and also of the
period of their long association. This trend also matches the
results obtained using function words. Taking a closer look
at the percentage in these three phases, it can be seen that
matching among the writings has dropped over time pro-
gressed. The reasons are obvious. In the first phase (JCB1-
JCB6), Bose wrote alone, hence we find a very high degree
of match among the articles of this period. In the second
phase (JCB7-JCB14), Nivedita started to influence his
writing style. So, we get texts that carry the signature of both
their styles. The last phase (JCB15-JCB44) also reveals the
same trend, though Nivedita’s influence has started to wane.
Hence, we get less internal matching of the texts written by
Bose during this period.
The results of the comparison between the first phase and
second phase (JCB1-JCB6: JCB7-JCB14); and second
phase and the third phase (JCB7-JCB14: JCB15-JCB44) do
not match, almost to the same extent. It clearly shows the
influence of Nivedita on Bose’s writings. On the other hand,
the writings of the first phase (JCB1-JCB6) and last phase
(JCB15-JCB44) are largely matching. This percentage is
almost identical with the percentage of the internal matching
of the texts produced in the last phase only (JCB15-JCB44)
which shows Nivedita’s influence on Bose’s writings still
existing but to a lesser extent.
Usage of Words
Lastly, we note that the number of words except scien-
tific terms used by Bose has increased considerably from
the first phase to the second phase, and then to the third
phase. We found that Bose used around 1,000 words in the
first phase. In the second phase, this increased to around
1,300, and then to around 3,000 in the last phase. It shows
that Bose, a non-native English speaker, was influenced by
Nivedita, a native English speaker, in his use of general
words. It may be correct that Bose wrote more in the
second than in the first phase, and that he wrote more in
the third than in the other two phases. It could also be
argued that Bose improved his English vocabulary.
However, it should be noted that it was not visible until the
third phase. During the first phase, he did not know
Nivedita. Hence, from this, it may be inferred that Nivedi-
ta’s assistance may have spurred him to improve his own
vocabulary. And, the presence of more than 100 common
general words that were not used in the first phase at all
but first introduced in the second phase and continued to
be used in the third phase shows that Nivedita may have
influenced his vocabulary. We also found that in a few
cases his habit of using synonymous words also changed.
For example, in the second phase his average usage of both
that and which increased. And this trend continued in the
third phase. Another example was his use of the word
towards. He never used the synonymous word toward in
his writings. But, he also never used the word towards in
the first phase of his writings. He started to use the word
towards in the second phase, a use which continued in his
writings from the third phase. This pattern may be con-
strued as Nivedita’s influence on Bose’s style of writing.
Conclusion
From the results, it may be concluded that Bose’s style of
writing underwent change after he met Nivedita. The data
show changes in the usage of the function words and punc-
tuation marks. He started with his own style. After meeting
Nivedita, his style of writing, both in books and journal
articles, changed. It is quite likely that Nivedita herself
edited or revised his manuscripts. It is also the case that after
Nivedita’s death, though slowly, Bose returned to his own
style of writing. The evidence suggests that Bose was indeed
influenced by “someone” who changed the style of his writ-
ings. This “someone” as mentioned by several biographers
of both Bose and Nivedita, and Nivedita herself, is Sister
Nivedita.
