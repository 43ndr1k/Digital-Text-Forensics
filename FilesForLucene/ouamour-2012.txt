Abstract— In this paper the authors investigate the task of 
authorship attribution on very old Arabic texts that were written 
by ten ancient Arabic travelers. Several features such as 
characters n-grams and word n-grams are used as input of a 
SMO-SVM (i.e. Sequential Minimal Optimization based Support 
Vector Machine).  
Experiments of authorship attribution, on this text database, 
show interesting results with a classification precision of 80%. 
This research work, which represents a rare text-mining work on 
the Arabic language, has revealed several interesting points. 
Keywords- Authorship attribution, Text-mining, Data-mining, 
Artificial Intelligence, SVM. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
Authorship Attribution (AA) is a research field of 
stylometry, which consists in identifying the author(s) of a 
piece of text by using some techniques of text mining. The 
longer is the text; the better is the identification accuracy. 
Stylometry or Authorship recognition can be divided into 
several related fields that are: 
- Authorship attribution (AA) or identification: consists in 
identifying the author(s) of a set of different texts; 
- Authorship verification: consists in checking whether a piece 
of text is written or not by an author who claimed to be the 
writer; 
- Authorship discrimination: consists in checking if two 
different texts are written by a same author or not; 
- Plagiarism detection: in this research field we look for the 
sentences or paragraphs that are taken from another author; 
- Text indexing and segmentation: when several texts, which 
are issued from different authors, are concatenated in a form 
of a global book or forum text, one particular interest in 
stylometry is to segment the global text into homogeneous 
segments (each segment (paragraph) contains the contribution 
of only one author) by giving the name of the appropriate 
author in each text segment (paragraph); 
In general, individuals have distinctive ways of speaking and 
writing, and there exists a long history of linguistic and 
stylistic investigation into authorship attribution.  
Although several works are reported for the English, Greek 
and Hebrew languages [1] [2] [3] [4], the authors have not 
found any serious research work made with Arabic texts. That 
is why, they propose in the present paper an overall research 
work of AA (Authorship Attribution) that handles 30 different 
texts written by 10 ancient Arabic travelers who wrote several 
books describing their travels. 
A special Arabic database has been built by the authors in 
order to assess several features and classifiers that are usually 
employed in stylometry. 
The experiments of AA are described in the following 
sections. 
II. DESCRIPTION OF THE TEXT DATABASE 
This database, which we called AAAT database (i.e. 
Authorship attribution of Ancient Arabic Texts), is built by the 
authors for a purpose of authorship attribution. It contains 10 
groups of old Arabic texts, belonging respectively to 10 
ancient authors. Each group contains 3 different texts that are 
written by a same author and each group corresponds to only 
one ancient author. This database has been collected in 2011 
from “Alwaraq library”.

B. Size of the texts 
As we can see in table 1, each author is presented by 3 
different texts. The texts are very short: the average text length 
is about 550 words; furthermore some texts have less than 300 
words. This situation involves bad experimental conditions, 
since it has been shown, in some researches done by Eder [5] 
and Signoriello [6], that the minimum number of words per 
text should be 2500 words in order to obtain a good attribution 
results.  
We have chosen to use short text documents in order to 
evaluate the SMO-SVM classifier using different features. 
Because, we know that when using short texts the AA 
performances  decrease.

III. DESCRIPTION OF THE SMO-SVM CLASSIFIER 
The different experiments of authorship attribution are 
made using a SMO-SVM (i.e. Sequential Minimal 
Optimization based Support Vector Machine). The SVM is a 
very accurate classifier that uses bad examples to form the 
boundaries of the different classes [7]. The SMO algorithm is 
only used to speed up the training of the SVM [9]. Our 
classification system is trained by the two first texts for every 
author, whereas the remaining text (the third one) is used for 
the testing. 
IV. EXPERIMENTS OF AUTHORSHIP ATTRIBUTION 
In this section, we present the different experiments of 
authorship attribution on an old Arabic set of texts that were 
written by old Arabic travelers.  
Several features are tested: characters, character-n-grams, 
words, word-n-grams and rare words. 
Furthermore a SMO-SVM classifier is employed (by using the 
jgaap tool kit [1]) for the task of authorship attribution. 
We recall that every author has three different texts. The two 
first texts are used for the training step and the third one is 
used for the testing step. 
Figure 1 and table 2 display the precision in % that is got with 
the different features. As we can observe, we obtained a score 
of good attribution of 80% by using one of the following three 
features: the character bigram, character trigram and rare 
words. This score is the best score for all the features that have 
been employed in this experiment. It is important to mention 
that an accuracy of 80% with short text documents is 
relatively high, since several previous works showed that the 
minimum amount of text that is required for a good A.A. is at 
45
least 2500 words per text. In this investigation very short text 
are used, ranging from only 209 words to a maximum of 800  
words in the text.

Figure 2 summarizes the overall results into some classes of 
features: the average precision for character-grams, average 
precision for word-grams, average precision for the good 
features and the precision that is obtained with rare words. It s 
easy to see that the character based features are better than the 
word based features. However rare words seem to be pertinent 
in this experiment. 
In the overall the average precision for all the good features is 
about 73%.

V. CONCLUSION 
In this research work a new authorship attribution task has 
been experimented on an old Arabic set of texts that were 
written by old Arabic travelers. Several state-of-the-art 
features have been tested for the Arabic language and 
particularly for very short texts. These two particularities 
(Arabic language and small text size) make the main 
originality of this research work. The classifier that have been 
used is a SMO-SVM as described in section 3, by using 20 
texts for the training and 10 different texts (not present in the 
training data set) for the testing. 
Experiments of authorship attribution of the 10 different texts, 
which have been done separately for each feature, show the 
following remarkable points: 
• The character-based features are better than the word -
based features for all the classifiers; 
• We notice a failure for the classifiers using the word-based 
features (attribution score about 10% and 70%); 
• Although, in this investigation, the word-based features did 
not give good results, the rare words features gave good 
scores for this classifier; 
• The best features are character-trigrams, character-
tetragrams and rare words (score of 80% for ever of those 
features).

• The SMO-SVM classifier shows good performances in this 
experiment of A.A. since the medium score with classical 
distances (experiment not described here) was about 60% 
(score of good identification). 
• Although the size of the texts was too small (between 209 
words and 800 words in the text), the performance of the 
classifier are really interesting (80% of good attribution); 
• This new work of authorship attribution, which is one of 
the rare works done on Arabic text, shows a real 
motivation and interest for this language. It also shows that 
the rules are almost the same for both English and Arabic. 
Consequently, one can exploit most of the knowledge that 
have been acquired over the time with the Latin or Greek 
language. 
Future work concerns the use of other classifiers, in order to 
see if it could be possible to outperform the present attribution 
score.
