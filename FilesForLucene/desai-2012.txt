ABSTRACT 
Optical character recognition is a very challenging area. Many 
works have been done and still being done for many 
languages across the world. For many Indian languages too 
good amount of work has been done. However, Gujarati is a 
language for which hardly any work can be found. Gujarati 
has a rich literary heritage, and therefore it is important to 
preserve it for the next generation. In this paper an attempt has 
be done to segmenting out the words and characters from old 
typewritten Gujarati documents. Here an algorithm is 
presented which makes use of global threshold for converting 
scan RGB documents to blank and white documents. Noise 
removal has also been applied. Here Radon transform is 
utilized for skew detection. The novel concept of using Radon 
transform is presented here in this work. Here Radon 
transform is used for segmenting documents into lines and 
then vertical profiles has been used for further segmentation 
of lines in characters. At last this segmentation algorithm is 
also tested for the documents typewritten in Hindi. The 
algorithm presented here gives very good results. 
Keywords : Segmentation; Radon transform; skew 
correction; digitization; noise removal 
1. INTRODUCTION 
Gujarati is a language with very rich literary, cultural, and 
historical heritage. One can find very old historical 
documents, literature, books and manuscripts written in 
Gujarati language. These documents carry lots of knowledge 
within them. Unfortunately, most of these high valued 
literatures is not digitized, as a result it will be difficult to 
preserve this knowledge and also difficult to pass this 
knowledge on to the next generations to come.  
Gujarati is a language belonging to Devnagari family of 
Indian languages. This is a language unlike many other 
Devnagari languages without having shirolekha over its 
characters. It is a language which is having 12 vowels (swars), 
34 consonants (vyanjans), and many modifiers (matras). Also 
Gujarati script is having many composite characters like u,Â 
etc. All these things make Gujrati Optical Character 
Recognition very difficult. In addition to complexity of 
language itself, complexity also increases if the script or 
document is handwritten or typewritten.  Complexity also 
increases if the physical documents are too old and degraded. 
If the documents are typewritten it is possible to have different 
inter-character and inter-word spacing. Also due to long time 
the background of the document has also got flawed and 
possibilities of vanishing of the text are also very high. In 
such scenario the segmentation of characters from old 
documents becomes very challenging. Figure 1 shows a 
sample of a Gujarati document.       
The document shown in Fig. 1(a) is approximately 35 to 45 
years old document. Observe that the background and printed 
characters. The quality of the documents is really week for 
optical recognition. Here in this paper the segmentation of old 
Gujarati documents in to lines and characters has been 
addressed. In this work some really exciting image processing 
techniques like Radon transform, skew detection and 
correction, noise removal, digitization and projections are 
employed. This paper is divided in five sections. In section 
two introduction of Radon transform is given. Section three is 
addressing issue of digitations, section four is discussing issue 
of skew detection and correction.

2. RADON TRANSFORM 
Here, Radon transform is utilized for skew correction and also 
for line segmentation. In recent time Radon transform has 
attracted attention of researchers working in the area of image 
processing and tomography. Radon transform computes line 
integral from multiple line sources along a parallel path in a 
direction. That means, it computes projections of an image 
from a specific direction, taken from different angles by 
rotating the source of projection around centre of image. The 
projection of a two dimensional image 𝑓 𝑥, 𝑦  can be 
calculated for any angle  using; 
𝑅𝑅𝜃  𝑥′ =   𝑓 𝑥
′𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜃 − 𝑦′𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃, 𝑥′𝑠𝑖𝑛𝜃 + 𝑦′𝑐𝑜𝑠𝜃 𝑑𝑦

The strongest property of Radon transform is its ability to 
extract lines from the image, even from a noisy one. Radon 
transform represents such lines in form of peaks. The Fig. 3

3. RELATED WORK 
The work presented here in this paper is mainly addresses 
three issues of optical character recognition, digitization of the 
old degraded documents, skew detection and correction and 
then the segmentation of the text into sentences and then up to 
single characters or composite characters. Here in this section 
some of the attempts have been mentioned which address 
these issues. 
In 2005, Ntzios et al. [1] presented a work dealt with old 
Greek handwritten OCR system. In this paper they made use 
of adaptive binarization technique for binarizing old 
documents. In the pre-processing stage they did 
skeletonization of characters in the document. Here authors 
presented OCR system without performing segmentation on 
the documents. Water reservoir technique was an instrument 
for feature extraction in this paper.  The position and the place 
of cavities of characters constitute feature set for the 
classification. This work has claimed accuracy level up to 
98.94%. In 2006, Kavallieraton et al. [2] worked on noise 
removal from old historical degraded documents. In their 
work they presented an algorithm which was having three 
stages. In the first stage iterative global threshold (IGT) was 
applied. In the second stage, using a fact that even after 
performing IGT still degraded portion of the document has 
more black pixels, they isolated yet noisy portion. In the last 
and third stage local threshold was performed on the portion 
isolated in the second stage. In this work they obtained 
precision up to 100%. Again in 2006, Kavallieraton et al. [3] 
has proposed a novel technique for binarization especially for 
degraded documents. Here in this work a hybrid approach 
based on both iterative global threshold (IGT) and local 
threshold have been used. Authors have claimed 97.6% 
success rate using this approach. Gatos et al. [4] also in 2006, 
presented a very good paper explaining adaptive binarization 
of degraded documents. In that algorithm authors had used 
low-pass Wiener filter as a pre-process and then interpolating 
neighboring background intensities were used for background 
rough calculation. In the next step of algorithm threshold 
value was calculated. Here threshold was based on 
background calculation done in the earlier step and the 
background of the original image. The last step of the 
algorithm was improving the quality of the text, for doing this 
stroke connectivity was taken into consideration. Agam et al. 
[5] presented a work to enhance quality of degraded 
documents. Here in the algorithm foreground separation was 
performed first, and then linear blending was used to improve 
the quality of image. The algorithm presented in this paper 
was then compared with other algorithms and proved better 
than them. 
Skew detection and correction is a problem which has 
attracted attention of many researchers. Manjunath et al. [6] 
presented a work to estimate skew from binary documents. 
The algorithm presented here was based on skeletonization, 
moments and boundary growing (BG) approaches. Also in 
this work a novel four stepped approach has been presented 
for thinning. The presented algorithm was compared with 
many other approaches and proved better than many of them. 
In 2001, Das et al. [7] also worked on correcting skew in the 
documents. In their work they used mathematical morphology 
for estimating skew in the documents. In this work 
mathematical morphological methods, in specific closing and 
opening, were used to constitute lines for each of them skew 
was measured and the median angle of all those skew angles 
was considered for skew correction. In 2007, Banshree et al. 
[8] presented an OCR system for printed Kannada documents. 
Here, Hough transform technique was utilized for skew 
detection and then segmentation for lines and words, vertical 
and horizontal projection were utilized. Murtoza Habib el al. 
[9] used Radon transform for detecting skew in the documents 
in Bangla scripts. Before using Radon transform to find skew 
angle, the authors have done pre processing for filtering out 
isolated dots, punctuations etc. and also found upper envelops. 
These upper envelopes were then utilized in Radon transform. 
This algorithm was tested for angle up to 45 degree. 
Like binarization and skew corrections there are many 
researchers presented their work on segmentation, and 
therefore many methods can be traced on it. Looking to the 
available literature it is found that the horizontal and vertical 
profiles are the most widely used methods for segmentation. 
However, here few attempts are presented for segmentation on 
documents in Indian languages. Bhagvati et al [10] in 2002 
used projection profiles for segmenting lines, words, and 
characters in Telugu and Gurumukhi scripts. They also noted 
that Run-Length smoothing algorithm is an effective way for 
segmenting words from text. In 2008 Sagar et al. [11] 
presented their work on Kannada text. In this work they did 
segmentation of Kannada script using the pixel information of 
the document. In 2007 Jindal et al. [12] presented 
segmentation of horizontally overlapping lines. This work 
addressed eight Indian languages. Here they used inter line 
gaps and projection for overlapping line segmentation. They 
considered Gurumukhi, Devnagari, Bangla, Gujarati, 
Kannada, Tamil, Telugu, and Malayalam printed text.

Seethalakshmi et al also made use of vertical and horizontal 
profiles for segmentation in printed Tamil text.  
4. DIGITIZATION 
For success of any optical character recognition digitations is 
an initial and the most important phase. Here for segmentation 
of Gujarati characters from over 35 to 45 years old 
documents, they are scanned using standard flat-bed scanners 
in 300 dpi resolutions in RGB format. A couple of sample 
scanned images is shown in Fig. 1.  For segmenting theses 
documents into lines and characters they are required to be 
converted in black and white. There are many methods used 
for converting RGB or grayscale image to black and white 
image. Global threshold and adaptive threshold are two major 
groups of methods. Global threshold method is a method in 
which one optimum value is calculated and then entire image 
converted to black and white, where as in adaptive threshold 
method various threshold values are calculated for different 
part of an image and then RGB or grayscale image is 
converted into black and white. Looking to the nature of the 
scanned document global threshold is adopted to convert RGB 
images to black and white images. Since the documents are 
old and typewritten after conversion into binary images 
scattered noise remains there in the images. This noise creates 
problem at the time of segmentation. To remove this noise 
median filter of 3 x 3 size has been employed.  
      
Figure 4  The RGB document and its binarized document 
Once RGB document has been converted into BW image, it 
has been observed in many cases that due to the conversion 
process some the parts of the text got isolated and some of the 
part of the text or word got so thin. To take care of such issues 
the image is dilated using morphological dilation. Let us 
assume that A, be the image and B be a smaller 2x2 set of 
pixels. Then the dilation would be; 
                     𝐴  𝐵 =   𝐴𝑥𝑥∈𝐵          (1) 
5. SKEW DETECTION AND 
CORRECTION 
In the digitized form of very old type-written documents skew 
occurs because of two things, one, the a document was type 
written with some skew and second, the document was 
scanned with some skew within it. In both of these two 
situations the skew generated remains uniform across the 
page. With this assumption Radon transform was used for 
finding skew angle. Here Radon transform was calculated on a 
BW image with 0 to 179 degrees of rotation angle around the 
centre of the image. This transform would give the angle of a 
vertical line and as we were looking for a skew in the 
horizontal line the angle of vertical line would be subtracted 
from 90 to get skew in the horizontal line. The sign of 
subtracted angle would give the direction of skew as well. 
After calculating the skew in the document the document was 
rotated to remove skew from the document. Fig. 6b is a Radon 
transform of a document shown in Fig.  5a. here light colours 
shows the place of straight lines which is at 890. Thus the 
rotation angle is of 10. Fig.6 shows the skewed document and 
skew-less document.

After skew correction the document image is ready for the 
segmentation. 
6. SEGMENTATION 
The prime objective of this work was to perform segmentation 
on the Gujarati documents. By segmentation we wanted to 
separated out each individual characters and composite 
characters. If all individual characters and composite 
characters got separated they can then be classified or 
identified. Here for us there were two tasks to perform. One, 
separating lines form the documents and second is separating 
words and characters. If typewritten documents are observed 
carefully one might observe a fact in Gujarati typewritten 
documents that there is considerable space between two 
characters in a word. This fact was utilized and that helped in 
segmenting characters directly without segmenting the words. 
In any language two lines are separated by some bank space 
between them. In other words, there is a line of background 
pixels between two lines. In the introduction section we have 
noted that Radon transform has got strong characteristic to 
identify and locate a straight line from a figure. Exploiting this 
feature of a Radon transform we separated lines from the 
document. Fig.6b shows Radon transform on a Gujarati 
Document shown in Fig 6a with 00 to 1790 degrees of 
projection angle. Also observe that there are many light 
coloured spots, which are the peaks of Radon transform, there 
in Radon transform at 900 and these spots are same as total 
number of lines in the document.

Now to identify the blank lines, that are line separators, an 
angle was found with the maximum valleys. Here valleys 
were nothing but the place where no foreground pixels were 
there, in other words they were the blank spaces. Observe Fig. 
7, where projection obtained by Radon transform at the 
identified angel, in this case it is 900, is shown, which shows 
the peaks with the written texts and valleys along with the 
blank spaces between the lines.   
After identifying the place of lines, those lines are cropped 
out, and as a result all individual lines were segmented out. In 
Fig. 8 one of the segmented lines is illustrated. 
The next step was to segmenting characters from these 
separated lines. For doing this vertical projection was used on 
each of the separated lines.  The vertical projections too will 
give the places of foreground pixels and background pixels. 
The place where we get peaks that indicates the presence of 
characters and the valleys indicate the blank spaces. In a line, 
spaces between characters are the separators between the 
characters; therefore the valleys are in fact the separators. We 
identified the places of valleys and then the characters are 
cropped out. Fig.8 shows a line and its vertical projection. Fig 
9 demonstrate the complete algorithm for segmentation of old 
Gujarati character segmentation.  
The algorithm presented here is tested for Hindi documents 
also. Hindi is also a Devnagari language unlike Gujarati 
language having shirelekha (headlines) above all the 
characters. Because of these shirolekhas this algorithm does 
not segmented out the Hindi characters from the documents, 
however, this segmented out Hindi documents up to words.  
For further segmentation from words to Hindi character 
separate segmentation process is needed. Refer Fig. 10 which 
shows the result of this algorithm on Hindi document. It is 
observed that the algorithm works very effectively for 
separating Gujarati characters, right and left modifiers, and 
composite characters. However, when the inter-character 
space is not sufficient, the algorithm identifies two characters 
as a single character. On an average in a line, which contains 
more than 30 characters, 2 characters are wrongly separated. 
In Hindi documents most of the time all the words are 
separated correctly. 
Gujarati and Hindi documents considered here, for testing this 
algorithm, are having on average 24 lines. On an average there 
are twelve words and total thirty characters or composite 
characters with modifiers. It is observed that on an average 
fifteen words and eleven words are wrongly segments in 
Gujarati and Hindi documents respectively. Similarly on an 
average  two characters or composite characters are wrongly 
segmented per line in Gujarati document.  The proposed 
algorithm segments lines and words of documents very 
efficiently. Whereas at the character level the algorithm works 
well with the Gujarati language,  but it does not give 
satisfactory results at all for the documents in Hindi language. 
Table 1 shows the summarized results.

7. CONCLUSION 
Optical character recognition for old and historical document 
is always a challenging work. It needed very efficient 
digitization process and then segmentation process for 
classification of characters. For old and typewritten Gujarati 
documents, the algorithm presented here works satisfactory. 
However, because of irregularities of type writers causes 
unequal inter-character and inter-words spacing the words and 
composite characters needs more processing to separate. At 
the same time, when this algorithm is applied to a language 
like Hindi, it works very fine to segment out documents up to 
word level. As a whole the algorithm presented gives very 
satisfactory result, which may be used for more than one 
language as well.
