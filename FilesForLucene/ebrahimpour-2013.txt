Abstract
In this paper, we develop two automated authorship attribution schemes, one based on Multiple Discriminant Analysis
(MDA) and the other based on a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The classification features we exploit are based on word
frequencies in the text. We adopt an approach of preprocessing each text by stripping it of all characters except a-z and
space. This is in order to increase the portability of the software to different types of texts. We test the methodology on a
corpus of undisputed English texts, and use leave-one-out cross validation to demonstrate classification accuracies in excess
of 90%. We further test our methods on the Federalist Papers, which have a partly disputed authorship and a fair degree of
scholarly consensus. And finally, we apply our methodology to the question of the authorship of the Letter to the Hebrews
by comparing it against a number of original Greek texts of known authorship. These tests identify where some of the
limitations lie, motivating a number of open questions for future work. An open source implementation of our
methodology is freely available for use at https://github.com/matthewberryman/author-detection.

Introduction
The field of data mining is concerned with the extraction of
unknown information and patterns using statistics, machine
learning, and artificial intelligence on large scale data sets. Its
application ranges from database searches to DNA analysis and
text classification [1,2].
Author attribution is the problem of identifying the authorship
of given texts based on characteristics that are not known to the
authors themselves. These characteristics are considered reliable
because they are inaccessible to conscious manipulation and
consistent – under the assumption that a given author has not
acquired a mental disorder, such as Alzheimer’s disease, where it is
known to affect style [1,3]. Author attribution is also based on the
assumption that each author has his/her own writing style that
acts as a fingerprint, and this is made possible as various measurable
features in written text have been shown to be unchanged across a
given author’s range of writing genres over time [4–6]. In 1851,
the mathematician Augustus de Morgan tried to determine the
authorship of the Letter to the Hebrews, in the New Testament, by
measuring word lengths. Since de Morgan’s seminal work, many
other methods have been developed [7–9]. In 1964, the first
computer-assisted studies – as opposed to manual based methods –
were performed by Mosteller and Wallace to investigate the
authorship of the Federalist Papers [10]. Today rapid advances in
machine learning, statistical, and software methods have led to
computer-based automated systems for detection of authorship
[11].
A key problem is to find features in written text that can be
quantified in order to reflect an author’s style. Once this is
achieved, statistical or machine learning techniques can be used to
analyse the similarity between pieces of texts. The fast growing
areas of machine learning and statistical methods assist in
processing the voluminous data, where traditional methods fail
due to sparse and noisy data [12,13].
In recent years, due to an increase in the amount of data in
various forms including emails, blogs, messages on the internet and
SMS, the problem of author attribution has received more
attention. In addition to its traditional application for shedding
light on the authorship of disputed texts in the classical literature,
new applications have arisen such as plagiarism detection, web
searching, spam email detection, and finding the authors of
disputed or anonymous documents in forensics against cyber crime
[14,15]. Our focus, here, is the classical literature, and future work
may be able to extend our methods to contemporary applications.
This paper is organized as follows. In the Methods section, the
discriminant features that are utilized are discussed. Our
classification approach, compares the use of Multiple Discriminant
Analysis (MDA) with Support Vector Machines (SVM) [16].
These methods are thus briefly introduced. The effectiveness of
our methods is investigated by applying them to a benchmark
comprised of a known English corpus. Next we apply our methods
to the disputed texts of the Federalist Papers, as this is a question that
has been previously extensively studied. Finally, we revisit de
Morgan’s problem by applying our methods to the question of
authorship of the Letter to the Hebrews in the New Testament.

Methods
Generally, there are three types of style markers for authorship
attribution: lexical, syntactical, and structural features. Lexical
features, for example, include the frequencies of words and letters.
Syntactic features include punctuation and grammatically distinct
classes of words, such as, articles and prepositions. Structural
features use the overall organization of the whole text, such as the
length or number of sentences and paragraphs. Since lexical
features are easy to extract and the result is usually unambiguous,
they play the most important role in computational stylometry
[17–19].
A number of methods, in the literature, utilize several features
and attempt to find the best subset via a feature selection
algorithm, leading to accuracies of up to 99%. However this
feature selection procedure may be corpus-dependent, thereby
limiting applicability for general use [11].
The stylometry marker used in this study is a lexical feature: the
frequency of key words. This is one of the best features
discriminating between different authors [11,20]. It is based on
the occurrence of a series of non-contextual words such as articles
and pronouns, for example ‘the’, ‘and’, ‘of’ in English. This
category of words has little or no dependence on the topic or genre
of the texts and the technique can easily be applied to different
languages – thus it can be argued that these are useful classification
features for different texts in order to determine authorship. A tool
is needed to break the texts into tokens to then count and choose
the most frequently occurring ones [21].
For a given authorship attribution problem, usually there is a
group of candidate authors with an associated set of known
authorship texts and there is a set of disputed texts requiring
classification. Therefore, the data are divided into a training
dataset and a disputed dataset. In order to find the set of function
words, first, by means of a C++ software program, the number of
occurrences of all words in the total dataset (i.e. training dataset
plus disputed dataset) is counted. Next, these words are ranked
from the most common to the least common, and the first n words
are chosen, where n is a parameter of the classification algorithm.
We shall call this set of words function words. Then the number of
occurrences of each function word in each text is counted. For
each text, the feature extraction algorithm outputs a vector
containing the frequency of occurrences of the function words.
This vector is normalized by dividing it by the total word count of
the corresponding text, in order to remove the influence of
different overall text sizes. The normalized vector is fed into to the
classifier as the input.
We examine two powerful supervised learning approaches for
performing data classification, Multiple Discriminant Analysis
(MDA) and the Support Vector Machine (SVM). The same
training dataset is input into both of them. To measure the
accuracy of the methods, leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-
CV) is employed.
Multiple Discriminant Analysis
Multiple Discriminant Analysis (MDA) is a statistical technique
designed to assign unknown cases to a known group by using
predictor variables. The first step in this technique is to determine
whether groups are significantly different with regards to the
means of the predictor variables. If there are significant
differences, then the variables can be used as discriminating
variables. By using discriminating variables, MDA generates
discriminant functions that minimize the training error, while
maximizing the margin separating the data classes. The basic idea
is to form the most possible distinct groups by maximizing the
intergroup variance, while minimizing the pooled intragroup
variance. If there are n groups in a training dataset, n{1
discriminant functions are generated. The ith discriminant
function is given by:
Fi(x)~cizbi1x1zbi2x2z:::zbimxm ð1Þ
where ci is the constant term, x1, x2::: xn are the observed values
of the style markers for each case and bi1, bi2::: bim are the
corresponding weights of those variables derived from the
discriminant analysis [22–24].
In this study, we use the SPSS statistical analysis software
package [22] to carry out the Multiple Discriminant Analysis. To
prevent over-fitting, stepwise MDA is preferred. In stepwise MDA,
at each step, all function word counts are evaluated to determine
which variables are most effective to the prediction of group
membership and those variables are added to the analysis. This
process is iterated. It will stop when there is no new variable that
contributes significantly to the discrimination between groups. So
all the function word counts go into the analysis, but some of them
may not contribute toward the discrimination between different
authors. So these function word counts do not go into the
discriminant function.
Here, MDA utilizes normalized function word frequencies as
the discriminant variables and the authors as the grouping
variables. The pre-classified training dataset is fed to the MDA
and the centroid for each group, that is the mean value of the
discriminant function scores, is found. The disputed text is
assigned to the author’s group that has the smallest Mahalanobis
distance between the group’s centroid and the disputed text.
Mahalanobis distance is calculated by:

(x{m)TS{1(x{m)
q
, ð2Þ
where x is the disputed text’s vector of discriminant function
scores, m is the mean vector of discriminant function scores for an
author’s group, S is its covariance matrix, and T denotes the
matrix transpose.
Support Vector Machine
The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised learning
algorithm, which uses a training dataset and then classifies the data
in question. It classifies data by finding the best hyperplane that
separates clusters of features represented in an n-dimensional
space. Linear classification SVMs use a real-valued linear function
f (x), which assigns the n-dimensional input vector x to the positive
class if f (x)w0, and to the negative class if f (x)v0. Here f (x) can
be written as [16]
f (x)~w:xzb~
Xn
i~1
wixizb ð3Þ
where : denotes the dot product, w is the weight vector that is the
normal vector to the hyperplane and b is bias or offset of the
hyperplane from the origin. Basically a SVM is a two class or
binary classifier. When there are more than two groups, the
classification problem reduces to several binary classification
problems. Multi-class SVMs classify data by finding the best
hyperplanes that separate each pair of classes [16].
The geometrical interpretation of a SVM in an n-dimensional
space is an n{1 dimensional hyperplane that separates two
groups. In this scheme the goal is to maximise the margins

between the hyperplane and the two classes. In a more
complicated situation, the points cannot be separated by linear
functions. In this case, a SVM uses a kernel function to map the
data into a higher dimensional space, where a hyperplane is
calculated that optimally separates the data. Many different
kernels have been developed, however, only a few work well in
general. Aside from the linear SVM, common kernels are the
polynomial kernel, the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel, and
the sigmoid kernel as defined here [25,26]:

There is no systematic methodology to predict the best kernel
with the best parameters for a specific application [24]. In this
paper, the best type of kernel and its parameters such as c and r are
found via an optimization procedure that maximizes the accuracy
of classification.
Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOO-CV)
Leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-CV) is applied to evaluate
the accuracy of both methods of classification. At every step, one
text is left out from the training dataset and treated as a disputed
author text [27]. The classification model is constructed on the
remaining data and the algorithm classifies the left out text. The
same procedure is applied to all of the training data set and the
classification accuracy is calculated by:

Results
We first investigate the performance of both the MDA and
SVM methods using a dataset in which authors are known with
certainty. For this dataset we use an English corpus of known
authors as listed in Table 1. Next we apply our methods to two
examples, in order to understand where some of the limitations
and open questions lie. First, we examine the question of the
disputed texts in the Federalist Papers – as we shall see this raises
question of what happens when texts possibly are the result of
collaboration, and suggests various items for future work. Second,
we investigate and revisit de Morgan’s author attribution problem
of the New Testament, where the authorship of the Letter to the
Hebrews has been debated by scholars since the third century.
Here, we use the original Koine Greek texts in the New Treatment,
illustrating how our approach is portable to non-English texts and
highlighting a number of limitations for future study.
Benchmark Testing on an English Corpus of Known
Authorship
To evaluate the accuracy and reliability of our methods, it is
necessary to first test them on a set of texts with known authors,
which do not have the limitations and deficiencies of the New
Testament or Federalist Papers. This forms a benchmark for
comparing the methods and evaluating the effect of limited text
length or training data set size.
Our selected corpus of texts, in English, is obtained from the
Project Gutenberg archives [28]. It contains 168 short stories by
seven undisputed authors, namely, B. M. Bower, Richard Harding
Davis, Charles Dickens, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Zane Grey,
Henry James, and Andrew Lang. All of these authors wrote
fictional literature in English in the same era (late 19th century to
early 20th century). So, the genre and the period of time is
reasonably uniform and the key discriminant feature is the
authors’ different styles [23]. Due to the differing lengths of the
books, we truncate each of them to approximately the first 5000
words. The texts are listed in Table 1. Both the MDA and SVM
classification methods are applied and the results are compared.
Figure 1 shows the LOO-CV accuracy for both methods using
different numbers of function words. The accuracy of both
methods improved with every additional function word up to
around 20 function words. Between 20-60 function words, there is
still some improvement, but after that the accuracy plateaus.
MDA Results
Table 2 shows the LOO-CV result of MDA for 7 authors and
100 function words. The numbers in the leading diagonal, show
the correct assignments and this occurs in 96.4% of the cases.
SVM Results
Author attribution problems, with a large number of datasets
and several authors, cannot in most cases be resolved with a linear
SVM. Choosing the type of kernel and kernel parameters are two
significant factors to consider for obtaining the best result. Aside
from the number of function words, the kernel’s parameters can be
optimized to obtain the best classification accuracy. Optimization
is carried out to extract the best possible kernel for the given
training data. The optimization process is a grid search with
exponentially growing sequences of r and c, where r and c are
varied using the values in the following sets: r
[f2{5,2{3, . . . ,213,215g; c[f2{15,2{13, . . . ,21,23g. This optimi-
zation first employs the LOO-CV technique to check each
combination of parameter choices and then selects those
parameters that result in the best LOO-CV accuracy. Next, the
final model is trained on the whole training set using the chosen
parameters [29].
The results are summarised in Table 3. With 95 function words,
92.2% of cases are classified correctly with LOO-CV. This
represents an improvement of 12% compared to best results of the
recent studies that adopted SVM classifiers [21,30].
This accuracy is quite good, but here there is a large number of
words in each text and the size of training data per author is also
large. In many real situations, texts can be rather short and there
are few texts per author. Hence, it is necessary to evaluate the
affect that limited training data has on the accuracy.
Affect of Training Dataset Size on MDA and SVM
Accuracy
To investigate the affect of training dataset size, while other
variables are kept constant, the number of texts per author is
changed. There are different numbers of texts per author available
in our dataset. The minimum number of texts per author is 14.
Therefore in order to investigate how the dataset size affects
accuracy, the classification procedure is repeated with 14 texts per
author, then 13 texts per author, and so on, down to zero texts. At
each step there are two groups of data, the group of texts that have
been used as a training dataset, and the remainder that we call the

hold-out dataset. As there are two different types of input data
(training and hold-out), we can adopt two measures to calculate
the accuracy at each step. The first measure is obtained by
carrying out LOO-CV across the training dataset. The second
method feeds the hold-out texts into the classifiers and it attributes
each of the texts to one of the candidate authors. In this test case,
we already know the actual authors of texts, so we compare the
classifier results with the already-known authorship to find how
many of them are correct. The accuracy will be the ratio of the
number of correct attributions to the whole number of hold-out
texts. Figures 2 and 3 summarize the results for both MDA and the
SVM, respectively. In both graphs the accuracies using the
training texts and the hold-out texts are shown.
The Federalist Papers
The Federalist Papers are a series of 85 political essays published
under the name ‘Publius’ in 1788. At first, the real author(s) were a
guarded secret, but scholars now accept that Alexander Hamilton,
James Madison, and John Jay are the authors. After a while
Hamilton and then Madison provided their own lists declaring the
authorship [31,32]. The difference between these two lists is that
there are 12 essays that both Madison and Hamilton claimed
individually for themselves. So 73 texts might be considered to
have known author(s) while 12 are of disputed authorship. These
12 disputed authorship texts are essay numbers 49–58, 62 and 63.
An early study carried out by Mosteller and Wallace (1964)
concluded that all of the disputed essays were written by Madison,
with the possible exception that essay number 55 might be written
by Hamilton [10,33]. Not all researchers agree with this
conclusion. Some scholars also suggest that essay number 64,
which is normally attributed to Jay, is written by Madison [31], so
we also consider essay number 64 as a disputed text. In total, this
gives us 13 disputed essays and 72 undisputed essays. Amongst the
undisputed texts, 51 essays are written by Hamilton, 14 essays are
written by Madison, and 4 essays are written by Jay. Three essays
(numbers 18, 19, and 20) are products of collaboration between
Hamilton and Madison [34,35].
The texts are obtained from the Project Gutenberg Archives
[28]. We put aside the three essays with collaborative authorship
and take the remaining 69 essays as the training dataset. The same
function word list (see Table 4) is used for our MDA and SVM
classifiers. Because there are three authors, MDA produces two
discriminant functions, that are shown in Figure 4. For the
Federalist Papers of undisputed authorship, the LOO-CV accuracy is
97.1%, close to the LOO-CV accuracy for the SVM, 95.6%. In
both methods the number of function words required to achieve
the highest accuracy is 75 words. The assigned authors for
disputed texts for both methods are summarized in Table 5 The
MDA results in Table 5 are obtained by attributing each text to
the author with the lowest Mahalanobis distance from the text.
The Mahalanobis distances are shown in Table 6. A more critical
approach is to only select an author based on lowest Mahalanobis
distance, if for each contending author the Mahalanobis distance
between the text and the contending author’s centroid is greater
than or equal to the longest distance (LD) between the contending
author’s known texts and the contending author’s centroid. Such
cases have a much higher degree of certainty, and are indicated
with an asterisk in Table 5.
Without exception, all asterisked cases are supported by the
SVM results in Table 5. Thus we can confirm the conclusion of
Mosteller and Wallace [10] that Essay 55 is likely to be by
Hamilton and essays 51, 53, and 62 are more likely to be by
Madison. We are not able to make a conclusion regarding the
remaining essays and suggest that future work investigate the
possibility that Essays 49, 50, 52, 54, 56, 57, 58, 63, and 64 might
be the result of some degree of collaboration.

The geometry of the MDA method allows us to develop an
intuitive new simple method for assigning a likelihood measure to
each authorship attribution, which takes into account not only
how close a text is to its assigned author centroid but also how far
away it is from the second nearest candidate author.
Let us imagine that a disputed text is close to the centroid of
Author A, and the next-to-nearest centroid is that of Author B. For
high likelihood of a match, we want the ratio
LA
MA
to be as large as
possible and certainly greater than unity, where MA is the
Mahalanobis distance between the disputed text and the centroid
of Author A and LA is the longest Mahalanobis distance between
Author A’s known texts and Author A’s centroid. Coupled with
this, we want the ratio
LB
MB
to be as small as possible and certainly
less than unity, where MB is the Mahalanobis distance between
the disputed text and the centroid of Author B and LB is the
longest Mahalanobis distance between Author B’s known texts and
Author B’s centroid. Thus we define the likelihood of a match r as
given by,
r~
LA
MA
{
LB
MB
: ð5Þ
The certainty of a match increases as r increases and it goes to
zero when the two terms are equal, as expected. By applying this
methodology to the Mahalanobis distances, in Table 6, we can re-
allocate the authorship attribution and rank them according to the
likelihood, r, as shown in Table 7.
As can be seen in Table 7, there is a relatively high likelihood
that Essay 62 was written by Madison. Other assignments have
less certainty, and in particular the last seven assignments that
have likelihood close to or less than unity are much less certain.
How can this be, given the very high accuracy of the MDA
method on the English corpus? A likely scenario is that the lower
ranked texts are the products of a greater degree of collaboration
between the authors, and this remains an open question for future
investigation.
The Letter to the Hebrews
Traditionally the Letter to the Hebrews is attributed to the Apostle
Paul, also known as Saul of Tarsus. After the third century AD
many scholars debated this idea. Three further suggestions for
authorship of the Letter to the Hebrews are Barnabas, Luke the
Evangelist, and Clement of Rome [36]. Luke and Paul are
amongst the authors of the New Testament, Clement was an
apostolic father and Barnabas was an early Christian disciple.
Works of these four possible authors with three other New Testament
authors including Mark, Matthew, John and another apostolic
father, Ignatius of Antioch, are tested to determine the most likely
author. All of these selected texts are written in the first century.
The function word method is used to obtain the set of the
stylometry vectors, and both MDA and SVM are used for
classification.

The New Testament and non-canonical texts are obtained from
Society of Biblical Literature [37] and Christian Classical Ethereal
Library [38], respectively. All the source texts are in Koine Greek
and we pre-process them to remove any headings, verse numbers,
and punctuation introduced by modern editors. Note that the
original Koine Greek has no punctuation marks and no accents. As
our software handles only the ASCII characters a-z and space, we
transliterate the Greek text into our required ASCII set using the
look-up table given in Table 8. A limited number of certainly
known author texts are available from the first century. The length
of text for each author varies from 5,000 words to 50,000 words.
Based on our experiments, an equal length of text per author, gives
improved accuracy. A possible solution might be to truncate the
texts to make them all of equal length, however this is problematic.
This is because we have limited data size and need to utilize and
extract any information hidden in all the available data. To
address this difficulty, the known texts of each author are
concatenated together and divided by four. The length of each
text for different authors now varies between 1,600 to 10,000
words per text, which reduces the ratio of largest to smallest text
from 10 to 6.25. Table 9 lists the names of the texts used for each
author along with their word lengths. The vector of the frequency
of occurrences of the function words is normalized by dividing by
the number of words per text. The normalized vectors are now
ready for entry into the classification stage. This method alleviates
the problem of different dataset sizes.
Applying stepwise MDA to the training dataset gives an LOO-
CV accuracy of 90.6%, which is quite good for such a small
dataset with several authors. Figure 5 shows the first three
discriminant functions for all texts.
Note that there are seven discriminant functions and the plot
shows three of them, for illustrative purposes only. However, in
order to calculate actual Mahalanobis distances, we consider all
seven functions. Table 10 shows the Mahalanobis distance
between the Letter to the Hebrews and each of the author centroids.
Note that Table 10 also shows the longest Mahalanobis distances
of each author’s known texts to the respective group centroid. The
results show that whilst the Letter to the Hebrews is indeed closest to
Paul, it is nevertheless further away than all the undisputed texts of
Paul. This illustrates the difficulty that underlies the centuries of
disagreement between scholars on the authorship of the Letter to the
Hebrews. The second closest author is Luke, who is also one of the
mooted authors. Moreover, using a SVM with an optimized
polynomial kernel, an LOO-CV classification accuracy of 87.5%
is obtained and the Letter to Hebrews is attributed to Luke. In fact, an
early statement on the authorship of the Letter to Hebrews suggested
that Paul initially wrote it in Hebrew and Luke translated it into
Greek [39]. So one possible hypothesis is that we are seeing the
effect of translation on the style of an author and this is consistent
with the results of our analysis.

Limitations of Study
A key assumption underlying all attempts at automated
authorship attribution is that the authors in question write with
a consistent style. It is known that style can dramatically change if
a mental disorder, such as Alzheimer’s disease, is acquired. A
limitation, in the specific case of the Letter to the Hebrews is the small
number of known-authored texts. Could there be other authors in
existence that are closer to the Letter to the Hebrews than Paul? There
are many extra-canonical texts in existence, and future work must
exhaustively check these when they become available in electronic
format. Whilst the likelihood function we adopted is simple and
provides relative ranking, it is without characteristic scale and is not
appropriate for absolute comparisons from corpus to corpus. Also
it implicitly approximates a hyperbolic distribution to the data and
assumes the points are spread in a circular symmetric fashion
rather than in an ellipsoid. Thus, future work may be carried out
in order to further elaborate the likelihood function.
Future Work
In this study we focussed on stripping the text of any
punctuation, as the developed classification methods are then
readily portable to other languages such as Koine Greek. Thus
when we tested our techniques using known English texts, we also
stripped the texts of all punctuation to get them into the form of
interest. Future work that specifically focusses on the authorship of
English texts may benefit from including punctuation, as it
possesses style information that may assist in characterizing an
author. When extending the work to classify authorship of emails
and SMS messages, it may be of greater importance to not only

In this paper, our investigation uses up to 100 function words for the English corpus, the Federalist Papers, and the Koine Greek texts. The frequencies of function words
in each text are used as classification features. The texts are initially pre-processed as follows: (i) all letters are changed to lower case, (ii) all accents are removed, (iii) all
ASCII characters not in the set a-z (ASCII codes 97–122) and space (ASCII code 32) are removed without insertion of a space. This is with the exception of a hyphen (ASCII
code 45) that is substituted with a space (ASCII code 32), (iv) all headings are removed from the texts, so that they only contain free flowing paragraphs, (v) any extra
items added by modern editors, such as editorial notes are removed. Whilst hagiographers wrote the Greek texts in capital letters without accents or punctuation,
modern editors insert these items for ease of interpretation. Thus, in order to recover the original Greek text, we apply steps (i) to (v). We do the same to English texts so
that they act as a punctuation-free benchmark test. As our software only handles the reduced 27-character ASCII set a-z and space, the Greek text is transliterated using
the Table 8. After this pre-processing, all the texts within each corpus are concatenated and word frequencies are counted. Words are ranked in descending order of
frequency of occurrence. This is shown in the table below. These key words are called function words.

These results use 75 function words for both methods, which yields the best
accuracy. The MDA results are selected using a simplistic approach where the
authors with lowest distances (highlighted in bold in Table 6), are selected.
However, greater certainty is achieved if the other contending authors have
high distances from the text being classified. The cases where both remaining
authors have distances greater than or approximately equal to the longest
distance (LD) of a known text, are indicated with an asterisk. Thus entries with
asterisks have a high degree of certainty, and those without asterisks are less
certain and possibly may have resulted from collaboration with the next nearest
author.

include all natural punctuation but also numbers, emoticons, letter
case, redundant spaces, and even idiosyncratic errors. Future work
may also investigate different types of feature vectors for
classification, other than word frequency, such as word recurrence
interval (WRI) [2]. A potential advantage of WRI is that it
removes any genre-dependence due to the specific use of words –
as it measures how words cluster, whilst disregarding the actual
words used.
In regard to elaborating the likelihood weighting for ‘soft’
classification of each text, possible future directions may consider
the use least squares optimisation [40–42] or fuzzy c-means (FCM)
methods [43–45].
Conclusion
In conclusion, we develop a methodology for automated
detection of authorship, using the frequency of function words as
classification features. There are three critical steps: (i) prepro-
cessing the texts, (ii) extracting classification features, and (iii)
performing classification. In regards to the third step, this work
compares the performance of a MDA classifier to that of a SVM
classifier. Whilst the accuracy of both methods is better than 90%,
the SVM is somewhat limiting as it provides only binary decisions.
On the other hand the MDA approach allows more flexibility, and

This look-up table is used to transliterate the Koine Greek alphabet to an English
equivalent. This is used because the software only handles ASCII characters a-z
and space. The software only requires a one-to-one correspondence between
Greek letters and our reduced ASCII set, and thus the actual ASCII characters
can be entirely arbitrary.

The table below lists all the Greek texts we used to compare against the Letter
to the Hebrews. We restrict this training dataset corpus to those texts that are
largely undisputed. The listing is grouped according to authorship and the
numbers in the right column represent the total word count for each text. In
order to reduce the variation of total word count from author to author, we
concatenate the texts in each author group and divide by four. This is why, in
Figure 5, there are four data points for each author.

enables us to develop a method of ranking authorship attribution
according to likelihood. For future work, the MDA approach may
therefore be more useful as a method for investigating the degree
of collaboration between authors.
With regards to the disputed essays of the Federalist Papers, both
the MDA and SVM approaches confirm present consensus of
scholarship that Essay 62 is indeed written by James Madison.
Furthermore the MDA method reveals that the match between
Madison and Essay 62 has the highest degree of certainty out of all
the 13 disputed essays.
On the question of authorship of the Letter to the Hebrews, we find
using the MDA method that texts of the Apostle Paul are the
closest in style, followed second by Luke the Evangelist. This
would appear to favour the traditional belief that Paul is the
author. However, the corresponding Mahalanobis distance is
longer than the furthest distance between any of Paul’s known
texts and their stylometric average, suggesting the link between
Paul and the Letter to the Hebrews is weak.
Thus there are two hypotheses to investigate in future work: (i)
could the Letter to the Hebrews have been originally written in
Hebrew by Paul, and then later translated into Greek by Luke? or,
(ii) could there be a further extra-canonical author that is closer in
style to the Letter to the Hebrews? At present, only a small subset of
existing Koine Greek texts are available in electronic format, and as
further Koine texts become available in the future, more exhaustive
tests can be carried out.

The Mahalanobis distance is calculated using the values of all seven
discriminant functions. The first column shows the Mahalanobis distance
between the disputed Letter to the Hebrews and the centroids of known author
texts. The Mahalanobis distance in the second column is the longest distance
(LD) between an author centroid and known texts by the same author. If a
disputed text is classified outside this LD bound, then it is only a weak match.
The lowest Mahalanobis distance is indicated in bold and belongs to the
Apostle Paul. However, this is outside the LD bound (i.e. 11:4w7:4) and the
likelihood index is less than unity at r~0:18, suggesting a weak match.
