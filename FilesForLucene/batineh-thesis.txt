ABSTRACT 
The analysis of style in translation discipline typically relies on methods borrowed 
from literary studies. Most of the style-related research conducted in translation 
studies has either focused on the style of the author or on the text type as manifested 
in the translation as opposed to the style of the translator. The few studies of 
translator style that have been carried out using corpus methodologies present some 
methodological limitations related to corpus compilation and control which affect the 
analyis of style. To address these limitations, the present study adopts an 
interdisciplinary approach combining Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), and methods 
from Corpus Stylistics, and Machine Learning Stylometry in order to develop a 
rigorous framework for studying translator style. The suggested framework is 
developed based on the investigation of the translations and creative writings of 
Denys Johnson-Davies (J-D), a British creative writer and an Arabic-English 
translator. This study attempts to trace instances where the style of J-D the translator 
intersects with the style of J-D the author. It investigates the effect of J-D’s 
translating activity on his own writing and vice versa in order to determine the extent 
to which the two activities influence each other. The computational stylistic (corpus 
& machine learning) and the thematic (LSA) analyses suggest that J-D’s style as a 
translator impacted his style as a writer. In addition, it was evident that translation 
helped J-D to develop his writing skills and style. Indeed, the translating activity 
served as a source of inspiration and intertextuality for his creative writing. As for the 
interaction between J-D’s creative writing and the post-creative writing translations, 
	  
	  
	   	  xiii	  
the findings show that J-D’s creative writing impacted the selection of short stories he 
translated after the production of his creative writing, which revolved around themes 
he developed as a creative writer.

CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION 
 
1.1. Introduction 
 This dissertation investigates the interaction between translation and 
creative writing activities of translators by focusing on the case of the translator-
writer Denys Johnson-Davies (J-D). J-D was the first and one of the most influential 
Arabic-English literary translators of Modern Arabic Literature. The study focuses on 
J-D’s style as displayed in his translations and his creative writings in an attempt to 
determine if his translating activity influenced or was impacted by his creative writing 
activities. It discusses the history and the impact that stylistics within literary studies 
has on the study of style in translation studies. It also reviews the literature related to 
translator style within translation studies. The study also highlights the limitations of 
previous research in this area; it establishes the need for more empirical investigations 
of translator style and proposes an interdisciplinary framework for translator style 
analysis combining methods from corpus stylistics, computer science and stylometry. 
The interdisciplinary nature of translation studies has encouraged translation 
scholars to adopt methods from literary studies in order to study style. However, the 
application of such methods in translation studies is still debatable and problematic. 
Within literary studies, Geoffrey Leech defines style as “the sum of linguistic features 
associated with texts or textual samples defined by some set of contextual 
parameters” (55). In translation, style refers to the Target Text (TT) style as 
	  
	  
	  
2	  
manifested in its type1 or to the translator style. The former has been studied either by 
tracing the manifestation of the Source Text (ST) style in the Target Text  (TT) 
(Reiss, Translation Criticism- Potentials and Limitations: Categories and Criteria for 
Translation Quality Assessment), by finding out the extent to which the TT follows 
the conventions and the norms of the target culture (Nord) or by examining the 
realization of the translation brief in the TT (Vermeer). The latter (translator style) 
has been studied through the analysis of the stylistic patterns of a specific translator 
that distinguish him/her from other translators.  
Kirsten Malmkjær defines translational stylistics as “the study of why, given 
the source text, the translation has been shaped in such a way that it comes to mean 
what it does [emphasis in the original]” (39). Works on translational stylistics have 
focused on either source texts or on target texts as their object of analysis. For 
instance, Eugene Nida, the leading theoretician of the linguistic school, focuses on the 
notions of content and form, message and style, as a way to talk about equivalence 
placing more emphasis on the style of the source text as a reference for producing the 
style of the target text. In contrast, the functionalist approach has shifted the focus 
from source-oriented to target-oriented stylistics. The study of style has become more 
concerned with the function of the TT and has departed from any stylistic constraints 
imposed by the style of the ST. Katharina Reiss, for instance, has taken style as a 
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
	  
	  
1	  Typology	  of	  texts	  based	  on	  their	  linguistic	  and	  stylistic	  characteristics.	  Based	  on	  these	  features,	  texts	  
are	  divided	  in	  to	  types	  depending	  on	  their	  function,	  which	  could	  be	  narrative,	  descriptive,	  expository	  or	  argumentative.

point of departure for her work on translation criticism. She relies on text types and 
the way the stylistic features of each text type should be exhibited in target culture 
and the target text (TT). According to the functionalist approach, a poem needs to 
function as a poem in the target literary system. In the same manner, a novel needs to 
function as a novel based on the norms and the convention of the target culture’s 
literature (Nord).  
With the emergence of the cultural turn, which placed more emphasis on 
translators as cultural mediators and translation as rewriting and manipulation, some 
scholars have started to argue for the importance of recognizing the translator’s voice 
and presence in his/her translations and for considering translators as one of the main 
agents in the translation process. Theo Hermans argues, for example, that the TT 
always implies more than one voice in the text, more than one discursive presence. 
He also indicates that the “illusion of transparency” and the “illusion of one voice” 
blind the reader to the presence of the other voice (27). In the same vein, Lawrence 
Venuti in The Translator’s Invisibility advocates making “the translator more visible 
so as to resist and change the conditions under which translation is theorized and 
practiced” (17). These arguments for a more sophisticated understanding of the 
translator’s voice or visibility have implications for the study of style in translation 
studies.  
The matter of close reading, i.e., the careful reading of passages with an 
emphasis on lexical choices, figures of speech and the syntax of a specific text, has 
dominated the study of style or voice in translation. Close reading might be a good 
	  
	  
	  
4	  
tool when analyzing style in isolated texts; however, it is not applicable to a large 
corpus of texts. In this kind of corpus, close reading becomes “untenable as an 
exhaustive or definitive method of evidence gathering [; and in following it,] 
something important will inevitably be missed” (Jockers 9). Tracing the stylistic 
patterns of a specific translator in a large corpus of different translations through 
close reading as a methodology is not only extremely time consuming and but it is 
likely that some stylistic patterns will be missed.  
However, compiling and analyzing a corpus of texts for the purpose of 
analyzing translator style is not an easy task. Studies on this topic are rare and are 
mostly derived from literary studies (e.g. Mason and Abdullah). Gabriela Saldanha 
argues that stylistics in literary studies, as defined by Leech and other scholars, are 
meant to study the “textual” style of the translation by focusing on the reproduction of 
the source-text style in the target text, and not the “personal” style of the translator, 
which is a ‘way of translating’ that “distinguishes one translator’s work from that of 
others, and is felt to be recognisable across a range of translations by the same 
translator” (Saldanha 28). In order to determine this style across different TT by the 
same translator, an interdisciplinary approach that goes beyond traditional close 
reading might be useful to allow translation scholars to analyze and reveal translator 
stylistic patterns of choice. 
Recently, translation scholars have begun to use computational methods in the 
analysis of style. One of the first studies that makes use of computational methods to 
analyze translator style is Mona Baker's “Towards a Methodology”. In her study, 
	  
	  
	  
5	  
Baker uses corpus stylistics, which is a method that makes use of the computer for 
extracting some stylistic patterns in a large corpus of digital texts. Another seminal 
work on translator style is done by Saldanha. Following Baker’s steps, Saldanha 
makes use of corpus stylistics to analyze the style of two translators in an attempt to 
develop a methodology and to propose a working definition for translator style. 
However, the two studies present some methodological problem related to corpus 
compilation, analysis and control. These issues are discussed in more details in 
Chapter two.  
What might be needed is a broader perspective that adopts interdisciplinary 
approaches to reveal the personal attributes of the translator. Within computer 
science, non-traditional authorship attribution (AA) and stylometry have exclusively 
worked on developing computational methods, relying on artificial intelligence and 
on statistical analysis to analyze authorial style. AA is a domain aimed at 
automatically analyzing texts based on their author’s style (Cristani et al.). Stylometry 
is also a field of study that draws on the use of computers to statistically analyze the 
style of one author or the variation in style between two or more authors. It builds on 
the assumption that writers have unique unconscious writing habits or features. These 
unique writing features are measured to create an author profile against which other 
texts or authors can be compared (Schulstad et al.). Tony McEnery and Michael 
Oakes define stylometric analysis as “an attempt to capture the essence of the style of 
a particular author by reference to a variety of quantitative criteria” (548). Different 
scholars in these varying fields have proven that methods used in such research are, to 
	  
	  
	  
6	  
a great extent, accurate (Grieve, Houvardas and Stamatatos and McEnery and Oakes) 
and outperform manual analysis of patterns of  personal style of text producers. 
Applied to the personal style of authors, methods from authorship attribution 
and stylometry could in turn be applied to the study of translator style. In this regard, 
Meng Ji argues that  stylometry is one of the best-established methodologies for 
studying the authorial style of any document author, “but it has rarely been practiced 
on translation texts in exploring literary stylistics or authorship attribution. As a 
result, many scholarly works on individual translators’ style seem to have based their 
judgments on limited excerpts randomly and irregularly selected from parallel 
source/target texts” (Ji 79). Thus, the present study draws on the notion of translator 
style and adopts methods from authorship attributions and stylometry in order to 
analyze and compare the authorial and the translational style of Denys Johnson-
Davies (J-D) and to propose an interdisciplinary framework for translator style 
analysis.  
 
1.2. Denys Johnson-Davies  
 Denys Johnson-Davies is one of the most influential Arabic-English 
translators of modern Arabic literature. J-D was born in 1922 in Canada to English 
parents. He spent his childhood in Cairo, then in Sudan (Johnson-Davies 1). At the 
age of fourteen, J-D attended the School of Oriental Studies in London. In the 
summer of that year, he went to Cairo to learn Arabic; this was his first academic 
encounter with the Arabic language and culture. During his stay, he attempted to 
	  
	  
	  
7	  
immerse himself in the Arabic Egyptian culture, frequenting traditional cafés in 
Cairo, where he made several friends. This gave him the chance to become familiar 
with Egyptian culture, daily life and dialect, which had a great effect on his 
translation work and text selection.  
The following year, Johnson-Davies went to Cambridge, where he began 
reading Arabic literary works in addition to extracts from the Qur’an. This experience 
increased his knowledge of Arabic language, literary style and tradition. After 
graduation, he was employed by the BBC radio. His duties included “checking 
translations made into Arabic of talks to be broadcasted” (Johnson-Davies 9). This 
was his first encounter with translation. At that time, he became eager to know more 
about Arabic language and literature, and he contacted famous Arabic short story 
writers, such as Mahmud Teymour, Naguib Mahfouz, Tayeb Salih and Twfiq al-
Hakim. 
 After meeting a number of Arab writers, Johnson-Davies took his first step 
towards translation in 1946 by translating two of Teymour’s short stories into 
English. He published translations in literary magazines, with the help of a friend. At 
that time, Davies was the only translator who was interested in translating Modern 
Arabic literature into English. He continued his career as an Arabic-English translator 
and he was the first to recognize and translate Naguib Mahfouz, the Nobel laureate. J-
D has translated more than thirty Arabic volumes including short stories, novels and 
biographies. He also won many translation prizes. 
After he had been translating for almost forty years, J-D began to write his 
	  
	  
	  
8	  
own short stories. He published his own collection in English under the title Fate of a 
Prisoner and Other Stories in 1999. The collection contains fifteen short stories 
discussing themes related to Arab culture and narrates stories taking place in different 
Arab countries such as Egypt, Sudan, Lebanon and the Arabian Gulf. However, J-D 
the author was not successful as J-D the translator. His translations received more 
attention than his creative writing. He mentions in his autobiography that his work, 
Fate of a Prisoner and Other Stories, “received no notices” except for two reviews 
one in Al-Ahram Weekly by John Rodenbeck, J-D’s friend and the other in The 
Literary Review by Francis King. 
Few works analyze the notions of creative writing and translating as two 
activities done by a single author/translator. To the best of my knowledge and based 
on the literature I consulted that dealt with the notion of translator style, the only 
study that investigated those two activities performed by a writer-translator is 
Walder’s “A Timbre of Its Own: investigating style in translation and original 
writing”. Thus, J-D’s translating and creative writing activities make a valuable case 
study for addressing the stylistic and thematic influence of translating on creative 
writing and vice versa. 
 
1.3. Research Hypotheses 
 The present study focuses on the translating and the creative writing 
activities of J-D and their impact on each other. It investigates whether the short 
stories J-D translated before the production of the creative writing have a thematic or 
	  
	  
	  
9	  
stylistic impact on his creative writing short stories and whether J-D’s creative 
writing short stories impacted his style and selection of short stories translated after 
the production of creative writing. To this end, this study tests the following 
hypotheses: 
1- The short stories J-D translated before the production of creative writing are 
close in theme to his creative writing short stories. 
2- The short stories J-D translated after the production of creative writing are 
close in theme to his creative writing short stories. 
3- The short stories J-D translated before the production of creative writing will 
display a number of stylistic characteristics similar to those visible in J-D’s 
creative writing. 
4- The stylistic characteristics of J-D’s creative writing are similar to those 
which are visible in the short stories he translated after the production of 
creative writing  
1.4. Research Method 
Three corpora were built to analyze the translational and the authorial style of 
J-D. The first corpus contains short stories translated by J-D before the production of 
his creative writing. The second corpus contains his creative writing short stories and 
the third corpus contains the short stories J-D translated after the production of his 
creative writing. This study only analyzes short stories translated from Arabic into 
English and written in English by J-D given the fact that J-D only wrote short stories. 
Including only short stories helps control the corpus for genre to make sure that genre 
	  
	  
	  
10	  
does not interfere with the stylistic analysis in this study. For the data analysis, this 
study applies three computational methods to analyze the style of J-D his translations 
and writings. First, Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) will be used as a fully automated 
methodology, taken from computer science, to conduct thematic similarity or 
relevancy analysis. The thematic analysis using LSA serves the current study in two 
ways: 1- it helps control the three corpora in this study for theme and 2- it helps 
reveal the thematic relation between J-D’s translations before and after his creative 
writing to his creative writing themes. The second method makes use of corpus 
stylistics, a sub-field of corpus linguistics that uses the application of corpus methods 
and tools to analyze style. Baker defines a corpus as “any collection of running texts, 
held in electronic form and analyzable automatically or semi-automatically” 
("Corpora" 225). Corpus stylitsics is used to analyze a set of style markers inclusing 
Standarized Type-Token Ratio (STTR), average sentence length and punctuation 
marks.  
The third method that will be used in this study is machine learning Profile-
Based (PB) approach. PB approach, adopted from stylometry, is used to build the 
authorial and the translational style of J-D in his translations and creative writing. 
Such  profiles contain different lexical and stylistic variables that show the personal 
stylistic attributes of the text producer. Machine learning PB is used to analyze  the 
following style markers: word n-gram, character n-gram and Part-of-Speech (POS) n-
gram. In this study, the style-markers profile analysis attempt to capture the lexical, 
semantic and syntactic variables in the writing and the translation of J-D in the three 
	  
	  
	  
11	  
corpora, short stories translated before creative writing, creative writing short stories 
and the short stories translated after creative writing.  
 
1.5. Significance of the Study 
This study addresses translator style as one of the largely ignored topics in 
translation studies. Saldanha points out that most work in translation studies focuses 
on the style of translations, as opposed to the style of translators (27). The study of 
translation style is source-oriented and focuses on the reproduction of the source-text 
style in the translation; while the style of translators is target-oriented focuses on 
stylistic patterns found in different translations produced by the translator. In 
addition, this study empirically investigates the relation between creative writing and 
translation as two activities carried out by one translator in an attempt to show the 
extent to which translating affects creative writing and vice versa. No systematic 
studies have been conducted in this area, and the only studies there remain anecdotal. 
In addition, an important issue in the study of translator style is the lack of a solid 
methodological framework to conduct this type of analysis. Even works on translator 
style done using corpus methodologies by translation scholars present some 
methodological issues related to corpus compilation and control (e.g. Baker "Towards 
a Methodology" and Saldanha). Furthermore, existing definitions of  a style markers 
or style variables are problematic. To address these issues, this dissertation adopts an 
interdisciplinary approach combining computational methods from corpus linguistics, 
computer science, and stylometry and authorship attributions to develop a rigorous 
	  
	  
	  
12	  
framework to study translator style. In addition, it proposes a style-marker profile that 
includes style variables, which are tested and approved by different scholars such as 
Stamatatos, Fakotakis, and Kokkinakis, Kim and Walter; Zhou, Xu, and Tan; Coyotl-
Morales et al. and Zheng et al., to capture the personal style of text authors. Lastly, 
this study discusses best practices related to corpus compilation and control for 
translator style analysis purposes.  
 
1.6. Summary of Chapters  
 The present dissertation includes seven chapters. Chapter one provides a 
general overview of the research on translator style in the field of translation studies. 
It also addresses the significance of the present study and lays down the research 
hypotheses. Chapter two provides a review of the related literature. It starts with a 
general overview of stylistics in literary studies; it shows the connection between 
stylistics in literary studies and the study of style in translation studies, and also 
provides an overview of the development of the study of style in the translations 
studies field. Chapter three describes the research methodology, data collection and 
analysis. Chapter four reports the results of the Latent Semantic Analysis method that 
reveals the thematic connection between J-D’s translations and creative writing. 
Chapter five provides the results of corpus stylistics analysis of Standardized Type-
Token Ratio (STTR), Sentence Length and punctuation marks. This chapter also 
reports the results of the second method of analysis, which relied on Machine-
Learning Profile-Based approach to analyze words n-grams, Part-of-Speech n-grams 
	  
	  
	  
13	  
and character n-grams in the three corpora in this study. Chapter six discusses the 
results of this study with reference to the research hypotheses that motivated it. The 
discussion is framed within translation theories related to the relation between 
translated and non-translated texts and the relation between creative writing and 
translation in order to reflect on the patterns discovered and to show the stylistic and 
thematic relations between creative writing and translation in the case of J-D. It also 
provides a proposed framework for translator style analysis and best practices related 
to corpus compilation and control for translator style analysis purposes. The last 
chapter in this study, chapter seven, summarizes the dissertation’s findings and 
discusses the limitations and proposes directions for future research.

CHAPTER 2: LITERATURE REVIEW 
 
2.1.  A Brief History of Literary Stylistics 
Literary style has attracted the attention of many scholars and thinkers. Ancient 
Roman and Greek philosophers such as Aristotle, Cicero, Demetrius and Quintilian 
treated “style as the proper adornment of thought” (Augustyn 1). They focused on the 
aesthetic function of literary style; the analysis of style was conducted to reveal the 
beauty of the literary piece. In this approach, the focus of stylistic analysis is mainly 
concentrated on metaphors, images and symbols. This view of style was held for 
many centuries and shifted only in early nineteenth century when style came to mean 
“the message carried by the frequency-distributions and transitional probabilities of 
its linguistic features” (Bloch 42). In modern stylistics, style has become a component 
of literary analysis revealing what a text means (Culler 906). This modern view of 
style can be traced back to the work of the Russian formalist, Roman Jakobson who 
argues that the goal of stylistic analysis is to reveal the “literariness” of a verbal 
message (Jakobson  360). Jakobson was the first to propose a framework to conduct 
stylistic analysis of literary works. His framework includes analyzing six text-related 
elements in order to reveal the function of a particular communicative act. These 
elements include: context, addresser, addressee, contact, code, and message of the 
verbal act. Jakobson indicates that these six elements constitute six functions of 
language including a referential, an emotive, a conative, a phatic, a metalingual and a 
	  
	  
	  
15	  
poetic function. Jakobson’s thoughts on literary stylistics have impacted the different 
literary schools and scholars in Europe and in America.  
Following Jakobson’s steps, Jan Mukařovský, a Czech literary and aesthetic 
theorist, addressed the notion of style in literature and argued that the style of a 
literary work is different from the style in “standard language”. His argument is one 
of the first arguments that discussed the style of non-literary works. Mukarovsky 
explains that what differentiates literary language from standard language is the use 
of some patterns that go against the norms of standard language (Allen). This in turn 
creates, what Victor Shklovsky calls, a “defamiliarizing effect” on the reader and 
attracts his/her attention (12). This deviation from ordinary language forces the reader 
to perceive the communicative act in a different way. 
Built on the ideas of Jakobson and Mukarovsky, the New Criticism appeared 
in the United States during the early twentieth century. It focused on the close reading 
of texts as a way to analyze their style. New Criticism “disconnect[s] the literary text 
from its social and historical context” (Jancovich 200). That is, the text itself is the 
independent unit of meaning and meaning is inside the text. Another literary school, 
Practical Criticism, appeared in Britain in the 1920s. This school adopted a 
psychological approach to stylistics and focused on the psychological effect of the 
interaction between the text and the reader (Richards 7). Michael Riffaterre, a 
member of this school, called for a new reader-oriented theory of style. In this theory 
he emphasized the importance of including an analysis of reader’s response in the 
stylistic analysis of the ‘act of communication’ (Clayton and Rothstein 24). 
	  
	  
	  
16	  
In turn, some stylistics scholars such as David Crystal and Derek Davy 
(1969), Nils Enkvist (1973) and Michael Halliday (1978) criticized previous 
approaches to literary stylistics for not considering the social context in the stylistic 
analysis of texts. Crystal and Davy called for studying the social impact and the social 
context in style analysis. They were specifically concerned with the question of how a 
certain context or a social event could restrict the stylistic choices of a writer or a 
speaker (Sharndama and Mohammed). Halliday also emphasized the importance of 
the social function of discourse. He propounded a theory of stylistics that combines 
the language system and the social dimension of the language. Halliday argued that 
the social structure and language are two inseparable entities in any act of 
communication (Bawarshi and Reiff 30). Thus, the analysis of any linguistic act of 
communication should consider the social structure that is embedded in and 
transmitted through language.  
The development and the combination of the social and the linguistic approaches 
to stylistics have paved the way for a new trend in literary stylistics known as 
discourse analysis. The discourse analysis approach focuses on context as an 
important component in the stylistic analysis of the discourse. Ronald Carter and Paul 
Simpson argue that issues such as gender, class, sociopolitical determinations and 
ideology cannot be ignored in the analysis of the discourse in any communicative 
event, written or spoken (14). This approach argues that the stylistic analysis should 
be “concerned not simply with the micro-contexts of the effects of words across 
sentences or conversational turns but also with the macro-contexts of larger social 
	  
	  
	  
17	  
patterns” (Carter and Simpson 14). The analysis of micro and macro contexts of the 
discourse and the contextual elements of the discourse, as proposed by this approach, 
takes into consideration the linguistic, the social, the ideological, and the political 
aspects of the communicative act. The development of the stylistic approaches to 
literary style has impacted the stylistic approaches to style in translation studies. This 
impact and the development of the stylistic approaches to style in translation are 
discussed in the following sections. 
 
2.2. Approaches to Style in Translation Studies 
Translation scholars who focus on literary translation have adopted approaches 
from literary studies to study and discuss style in translation. For instance, the notions 
of literariness (Jakobson) and “defamiliarizing effect” (Shklovsky) have impacted the 
works of translation scholars on stylistics and generated a text-oriented view of style. 
This particular approach focused on the stylistic peculiarities of the source text and 
how they should be manifested in the target text. Halliday’s theory of stylistics, which 
focuses on the importance of the social function of the discourse, has also shifted the 
focus of translational stylistics to take a functional turn considering the stylistic 
function the TT in its new context, the target culture. Carter and Simpson’s 
discourses-analysis approach to literary style, which draws on the critical and on the 
close reading of texts to reveal the hidden intended meaning of texts that is beyond 
the physical representation of the signs in the verbal discourse, has generated a 
descriptive approach to translational stylistics with a focus on the translator as a 
	  
	  
	  
18	  
cultural agent. The reader-oriented theory to literary stylistics as proposed by Michael 
Riffaterre has paved the way for a reader-oriented and a cognitive approach to style in 
translation studies. This approach, as proposed by Jean Boase-Beier, argues that the 
style of the text is determined by the cognitive state of the reader. It also argues that 
the translator, as a reader, attempts to understand the mind in the ST (the attitude of 
the ST author) in order to reflect to this mind style and then to recreate it in the 
translation. 
Translation scholars and theorists have followed different approaches to 
discuss the notion of style in translation. The study of style in translation studies has 
taken three main forms. The first one is text-oriented. This approach focuses on either 
the style of the ST and its manifestation in the TT (comparative approach) or on the 
style of the TT and its adaptation in the target culture (functionalist approach). The 
second approach to translation stylistics focuses on translator style or presence in 
his/her translations; while the third approach takes a cognitive turn. This later 
approach builds on cognitive linguistics to study the relation between text and mind. 
It views style as a cognitive entity rather than a textual one (Boase-Beier, Stylistic 
Approaches to Translation). The following sections review and discuss in some 
details the literature pertaining to the study of style in translation studies. 
 
2.3.  Text-Oriented Approaches   
As mentioned earlier, the first approaches to style in literary studies have 
focused on the stylistic features of texts as manifested in the linguistic choice of the 
	  
	  
	  
19	  
author. These approaches ignore the cognitive and the ideological dimensions of 
texts. Similarly, text-oriented approaches to style in translation have focused on the 
textual attributes of the ST or/and the TT. Scholars who adopt a textual approach to 
translation stylistics are divided into two main groups. The first group, which adopts a 
comparative approach, is concerned with a comparative analysis of the ST style and 
the TT style. These scholars either focus on the divergence of the TT style from that 
of the ST (Boase-Beier, “Knowing and Not Knowing") or on how the ST style should 
be rendered in the TT ( Nida and Vinay and Darbelnet). The second group adopts a 
functionalist approach, which stresses the importance of adapting the TT style to the 
norms and conventions of the target culture. This approach places a minimal 
emphasis on the style of the ST ( Nord, Vermeer). 
 
2.3.1. Comparative Approach 
Text-oriented comparative approaches to style in translation focus on the style 
of the ST and on the manifestation of this style in the TT. Scholars within this 
tradition, such as Eugene Nida and Chales Taber, and John Catford argue that the 
translator should always take the style of the ST as a point of departure to create the 
style of the TT. They argue that the style of the ST should be rendered as closely as 
possible in the TT. This view has generated a comparative approach to style in 
translation, which focuses on the style of the ST and on the manifestation of this style 
in the TT. 
	  
	  
	  
20	  
Vinay and Darbelnet pioneered the study of comparative stylistics in 
translation. In their book, Comparative Stylistics of French and English2, they stress 
the importance of conducting a stylistic analysis of the ST to identify potential 
difficulties and problems and to propose solutions to ultimately reach a “good” 
translation. Vinay and Darbelnet identify some stylistic difficulties that face English 
French translators and classify them into categories in order to find systematic 
solutions to those problems. They also discuss some basic linguistic notions, such as 
servitude and option, and relate them to stylistic analysis in translation. They indicate 
that servitude belongs to the grammar system of a certain language, whereas option 
refers to the domain of stylistics. They argue that “In the analysis of the SL, 
translators must pay particular attention to the options which constitutes the style of 
the ST author. In the TL, translators must pay attention to the servitudes, which limit 
their freedom of action” (16). Vinay and Darbelnet also discuss two types of 
stylistics: internal stylistics, which “seeks to isolate the means of expression of a 
given language by contrasting the affective with the intellectual elements” and 
comparative stylistics, which “seeks to identify the expressive means of two 
languages by contrasting them” (17). In their model, they indicate that translators are 
concerned with comparative stylistics and should not ignore internal stylistics. As for 
the relation between the ST and the TT style, they point out that translators must 
preserve the tone of the texts they translate, if possible. For Vinay and Darbelnet, the

21	  
focal point in the stylistic analysis is the ST and the TT should be produced in light of 
the stylistic analysis of the ST.  
Vinay and Darbelnet’s work on translation and stylistics relies on analyzing 
the stylistic peculiarities of the ST to produce a stylistically “equivalent” TT. Vinay 
and Darbelnet adopt a purely linguistic approach that ignores some important 
elements in the translation process such as the discourse itself, the target culture, the 
target reader and the translator. They consider the ST as an independent unit and the 
stylistic analysis of the linguistic features of texts is enough for the translator to reach 
a “good” translation.  
This view of style is also discussed by Eugene Nida, the pioneer of the 
linguistic turn. Nida points out that translators always face the conflict between form 
(style) and meaning (message). If they attempt to approximately maintain the stylistic 
qualities of the text, translators are likely to sacrifice much of the meaning (2). As for 
the translation of style, he argues that “the message in the receptor language should 
match as closely as possible the different elements [including message and style] in 
the source language. (159). Nida discusses his view of style by distinguishing two 
types of equivalence. First, dynamic equivalence in which the original text is 
translated into a target language and the response of the receptor in the target culture 
is essentially like that of the original receptors. In this type of translation, “the form of 
the original text [style] is changed” but is still resemble that of the original (200). The 
second type is formal equivalence, a type of translation in which “the features of the 
form of the source text have been mechanically reproduced in the receptor language” 
	  
	  
	  
22	  
(201). In both types, the style and the message of the ST are constantly compared 
with those in the TT to determine the standards of accuracy and correctness. In his 
approach, Nida stresses the importance of the ST as a point of departure for 
producing a “faithful” translation, which also entails the production of the same style 
in the TT, if possible. His discussion of style in translation does not account for the 
stylistic function of the TT in the target culture or the stylistic preferences of the 
target culture.  
This view of style is rejected by Katharina Reiss. She was one of the first 
translation scholars to discuss a functionalist approach to style. Her approach is also 
comparative; however, it places more emphasis on the target text and culture 
compared to Nida’s and Vinay and Darbelnet’s approaches. In her approach, she 
builds on the stylistic features of texts and on the way the style of each text type 
should be exhibited in translation. Reiss argues that the style of written language is 
determined by the function of the text. She stresses the importance of the stylistic 
analysis of the ST to realize the communicative function of the ST in order to recreate 
the same function in the TT. Reiss argues that there are three main text types3 
depending on the function of the language in the text. First, in content-focused texts, 
the function of the language in this kind of texts is to deliver content or a message. 
Second, form-focused texts, which have a unique form or style, show the peculiarities 
of a specific genre or the stylistic characteristics of a specific author. Third, appeal-

23	  
focused texts represent the persuasive function of language. Reiss believes that 
equivalence is being reached by paying more attention to text type and to how each 
text type should be translated to fulfill its function in the target language. For 
instance, an absurd play should function as an absurd play in the target culture. Thus, 
the translation process takes the function of the ST as a point of departure in creating 
its counterpart in the target culture.  
Reiss proposes a model for translation criticism based on text style. She 
argues that “the analysis and evaluation of a translated text can serve as the first stage, 
but it must be followed by the second and indispensable stage of comparison with the 
source text (10). Reiss criticizes translation critics and reviewers for not comparing 
the translation to its original text. Her model also sets the rules for this comparison. 
She argues that “in a content-focused text it is always appropriate to eliminate 
obvious errors and compensate for stylistic defects. In a form-focused text, on the 
other hand, a translator’s stylistic or other faults should not be ignored” (64). Reiss 
places emphasis on the style of form-focused texts, compared to other text types. She 
argues that in this types of texts, “the translator will not mimic slavishly (adopt) the 
forms of the source language, but rather appreciate the form of the source language 
and be inspired by it to discover an analogous form in the target language” (33). 
Reiss' approach to style is different from that of Nida. She looks at the style of the ST 
as a source of inspiration for the translator in creating the style of the TT. From a 
functionalist point of view, Reiss argues that the translator should appreciate and be 
	  
	  
	  
24	  
inspired by the ST style to produce a TT that blends the ST style with the stylistic 
conventions of the target culture to reach stylistic textual “equivalence”. 
Boase-Beier also adopts a comparative approach and discusses the notion of 
style in poetry. She argues that “style in poetry has the power to create cognitive 
effects in the reader where content alone can fail to” (“Knowing and not knowing” 
34). From this point, Boase-Beier stresses the importance of understanding and 
reproducing the source poem’s poetic effect that is embedded in its style. In her 
discussion, Boase-Beier analyzes the English translation of a German poem about the 
Holocaust to show how the manifestation of ambiguity in the style of the source poem 
is rendered into English. Boase-Beie’s discussion concentrates on the fact that style is 
a very important component of any poem and translators should preserve the essential 
characteristics of the original in producing the translation. Her approach to style is 
comparative; however, Boase-Beier places more emphasis on the translator as the 
reader and the creator of the TT (compared to Nida, Vinay and Darbelnet and Reies). 
Boase-Beier points out that the style of the ST carries clues for the author’s intention 
and devices that have a particular effect on the reader. That is, the ST should be the 
main focus of the translator’s efforts, if the translator wants to create the same poetic 
effect of the ST. Like Vinay and Darbelnet, Boase-Beier  argues that the stylistic 
analysis of the source poem/text is the first step towards understanding it. She also 
agrees with Reiss that the translator should seek to create the same effect of the ST in 
the translation. Boase-Beier points out that creating a poetic effect that is close or 
similar to that of the source poem can be achieved by revealing the author’s intention, 
	  
	  
	  
25	  
which has been a very problematic notion in literature. 
The source-oriented approach to style in translation has placed more emphases 
on the ST as the main reference for the translation process as compared to the target 
text and culture, which may have a considerable effect on the style of the TT. The 
functionalist turn in translation studies, as proposed by Nord and Vermeer among 
others, has shifted this view by placing more emphasis on the function or the purpose 
of the TT in the target culture. This shift has generated a target-oriented approach to 
the study of style. This approach argues that the function or the purpose of the TT 
determines the style of the translation. It rejects any stylistic or textual constrains 
imposed by the ST. 
 
2.3.2. Target-Oriented Approach 
In the functionalist approach to translation studies, as represented by 
Christiane Nord, Hans Vermeer among others, the translation process is viewed as 
always carried out with a function and a purpose (skopos) in mind. That is, the 
function of the TT, whether literary or non-literary, and the skopos4 of the translation 
are the components that govern the production of any translation. This view has 
generated a target-oriented functional view of translation that values the function or 
the purpose of the translation and refuses the ST to be the reference for the translation 
process. In this regard, Christina Schäffner argues that “the starting point for any 
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
	  
	  
4 It means purpose, aim or goal. It is derived from the Greek word “skopós”. 
	  
	  
	  
26	  
translation is therefore not the (linguistic surface structure of the) source text (ST), 
but the purpose of the target text. The Skopos of the ST and the Skopos of the TT can 
be either identical or different” (133). This target-oriented view of translation has 
radically changed the long-held view of translation as a process of linguistic matching 
that seeks “equivalence” and “faithfulness”.  
 Vermeer discusses the skopos theory and its application in translation 
theory. He argues that translation is a type of human action. This action is an 
intentional, purposeful behavior that takes place in a given situation; it is part of the 
situation at the same time as it modifies the situation (qtd. in Nord 11). Vermeer also 
argues that the translator is the expert in the translation project and he/she is the one 
who is responsible of the translation. This also indicates that the translator as an 
expert in the ST and the TT contexts is the one who chooses the “best” way and the 
“best” strategy to fulfill the translation skopos, which also determines the degree of 
the TT quality (Nord 28). Unlike the previous linguistic approaches that draw on the 
notion of equivalence, where the ST is the reference of the relationship between the 
ST and the TT, the functionalist approach argues that “the quality and quantity of … 
[the ST and the TT] relationship are specified by the translation skopos” (Nord 28). 
According to Nord, the skopos of the translation can be embedded in the translation 
brief. She argues that ‘adequacy’ refers to the qualities of a target text with regard to 
its translation brief (35). As discussed earlier, Reiss functional view of style discusses 
the style of the text as a whole. Skopos theory, on the other hand, argues that style is 
applicable not only to entire texts but also to text segments (Nord 33).

Target-oriented functionalist scholars link style to the function or to the 
purpose of the TT. This has shifted the view of style as a ST component that should 
be taken into consideration in creating a TT, to treat style as a component of the TT 
that needs to adapt to the skopos or the function of the TT. Thus, translation brief, 
skopos or function determines the style of the TT. However, Nord and Vermeer’s 
arguments for a functional target-oriented view of translation have ignored the human 
agent in the translation process, the translator. Translation scholars, such as Harish 
Trivedi and Susan Bassnett, Venuti and Hermans among others, have called for 
paying more attention to the presence of translators in their translation. This view has 
impacted the study of style by paving the way for translator style to emerge as a 
major current in translation stylistics.  
 
2.4. Translator-Oriented Approaches 
The text-oriented approaches to style have placed more emphasis on texts and 
have ignored the human agent of the translation process, the translator. Recently, 
more attention has been paid to translators and their presence and voice in their 
translations. One of the first works that discusses translators in their translations is 
The Translator's Invisibility (1995) by Venuti. His work underlines the importance of 
translator’s presence in translated texts. Venuti challenges the previous functionalist 
approach to translation, which stresses the importance of making the target text fluent 
as an original text and not as a translation. He indicates that “the more fluent the 
translation, the more invisible the translator, and, presumably, the more visible the 
	  
	  
	  
28	  
writer or meaning of the foreign text” (1). He argues that this act of making the TT 
transparent, through domestication5, is an act of violence, which stems from the fact 
that a transparent translation reconstructs the foreign text in accordance with the value 
and the beliefs that preexists in the target language (18). Venuti argues against 
domestication and calls for adopting foreignization6 as a translation strategy to 
restrain the ethnocentric violence of translation. He stresses the importance of keeping 
the style of the ST in translation even if the style of the ST seems unfamiliar in the 
target culture. He refuses any stylistic adaptation that could lead to a fluent TT and 
results in a transparent translation where the TT does not read as a translation. Theo 
Hermans also discusses the presence of translators in their translation. He indicates 
that translators’ voice is present in every translation they produce. Venuti and 
Hermans’ notions of translator voice and presence can be embedded in the translator 
style in the TT. 
Baker took Hermans and Venuti's arguments a step further and empirically 
investigated the translator’s voice and presence in the target text. Her work took the 
TT as a point of departure to trace the translator style in his/her different translation, 
which she refers to as “translator’s fingerprint” (Baker “Towards a Methodology’). In 
her study, she used corpus stylistics, which is a method that makes use of the

computer for extracting some stylistic patterns in a large corpus of digital texts. Baker 
built two corpora to analyze the style of two translators into English, Peter Bush and 
Peter Clark. Peter Bush’s corpus contains translation of one fiction work from 
Portuguese, Turbulence (1994), by Chico Buarque and translations of two fiction 
works from Spanish, Quarantine (1994) by Juan Goytisolo and Strawberry and 
Chocolate (1995) by and Paz Senel. It also contains translations of two Spanish 
autobiographies, Forbidden Territory (1989) and Realms of Strife (1990), written by 
one author, Juan Goytisolo. Peter Clark’s corpus contains translations of one 
collection of Arabic tales, Dubai Tales (1991), by Muhammad al Murr and a 
collection of tales, Grandfather’ s Tale (1999) and a novel, Sabriya (1997), written by 
the same author, Ulfat Idilbi. For the corpus analysis, Baker looked for patterns 
related to Standardized Type/Token Ratio (STTR)7, average sentence length and 
pattern frequency in using the word SAY in its all forms  (say, says, said, saying). 
Baker’s model is an innovation not only in its approach to style but also in its 
method of analysis. Baker’s study, in fact, has opened the way for further empirical 
studies that can address the limitations of her study. For instance, the two corpora in 
Baker’s study were not homogenous; they included genres varying from novels, tales, 
autobiographies and short stories. One could argue that translator style may vary 
depending on the genre into another and this, in turn, affects style analysis. In 
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
	  
	  
7	  	   “Type/token ratio is a measure of the range and diversity of vocabulary used by a writer, or in a given corpus. It is the 
ratio of different words to the overall number of words in a text or collection of texts” (M. Baker, “Towards a Methodology for 
Investigating the Style of a Literary Translator”). STTR is calculated for the first 1000 running words (tokens), and then 
calculated a fresh TTR for the next 1000. 
	  
	  
	  
30	  
addition, a given stylistic pattern in the TT may reflect the conventions of a certain 
genre and is not necessarily related to the translator style. Another issue arising from 
Baker’s corpora is the use of two works written by the same author. In this case, there 
is a higher chance of finding some patterns in the translated texts that are related to 
the STs author’s style and not to the translator’s.  
Baker’s use of STTR as a style marker poses a methodological question. STTR 
captures the creativity degree of an author; in translation, it also shows if the 
translator has a rich or a limited lexical capacity. However, to conduct a STTR 
analysis with a higher level of accuracy, the corpus should be controlled for theme 
and genre. Some themes may have a limited number of lexical choices compared to 
others, which in turn limit the lexical creativity of the text author. In this regard, 
George Mikros and Eleni Argiri empirically investigated theme influence on text 
author’s style analysis, using STTR and other style variables, reporting that text theme 
has a considerable influence on the analysis of the author’s style. Genre also affects 
STTR analysis; for instance, biographies would differ from tales not only in lexical 
density, but also in style. This proves true for tales in Arabic, which are oral 
traditional stories relying on repetition to build the story line (Mohamed and Omer). 
Any STTR analysis of tales would show this characteristic, and any comparison 
between STTR of tales and STTR of other genres such as novels and short stories 
would show such a distinction in lexical richness. Baker’s corpus also included 
English translations of texts from different languages, including Arabic, Portuguese, 
and Spanish. This may also affect STTR analysis or what is called “lexical density.” 
	  
	  
	  
31	  
Some languages, such as Arabic, value repetition as a matter of stylistic elegance, and 
this might be reflected in the target text.  
Another example of a study of translator’s style, which uses corpus analysis, 
is Diva De Camargo’s. In her study, she analyzed translator style in an attempt to find 
the extent to which the style of the ST author is reflected in the style of the translator 
and whether the target text shows a distinctive recurring and preferred marks of 
linguistic behavior of that translator. De Camargo  analyzed one Portuguese literary 
work, Tocaia Grande: a face obscura (1984) by Jorge Amado (original text (OT)), 
and its translation into English, Showdown (1988), translated by Gregory Rabassa 
(TT subcorpus). She used of corpus stylistics and analyzed number of tokens and 
types, type/token ratio TTR and STTR. De Camargo also uses two control corpora, 
The British National Corpus (BNC8, BNC fiction corpus (BNC fn)) and the Banco do 
Português (BP)9. She conducted her experiment in four steps. First, using WorSmith 
tool (Scott 1998), she retrieved statistics related linguistic pattern distribution in terms 
of TTR and STTR in both texts, TT and OT. Second, she conducted TT/TO 
comparisons by tokens (frequency of words) and types (word forms). Third, she 
compared TT TTR and STTR to that of British National Corpus − BNC. Finally, she 
compared OT TTR and STTR with the TTR and STTR scores of the Banco do 
Português (BP).  
De Camargo’s results show that the English translation of Tocaia Grande,

32	  
Showdown registers a lower number of tokens and types in relation to its original text. 
She also found that the translator has a lower TTR and STTR compared to the original 
author. As a second stage of analysis, she compared the translator’s language use (in 
his translation of Tocaia Grande, a corpus contains 141,608 words) and the language 
use in the BNC corpus, a 90,748,880-word corpus contains general English text 
originally written in English. She also compared the TT to the BNC fn corpus, which 
contains different fiction works for different genres written between 1985—1994 in 
English containing 19,444,150 words. She found that the translator shows a richer 
and more varied language use, a higher TTR and a higher STTR, compared to those of 
the BNC and the BNC fn. De Camargo also compared the TTR score of both OT 
(with 159,440 words) and BP (with 230,460,560 words). Her analysis shows that the 
OT has a higher TTR compared to the TTR in BP. The same thing applies for STTR 
analysis. De Camargo concludes that since the TTR and STTR analysis show that 
Rabassa has a lower score compared to Amado’s, this can be an indicator of the 
translator’s divergence from the OT. She concluded that Rabassa presents a much 
higher diversified use of linguistic patterns and much less vocabulary repetition than 
what is found in the variety of text-types represented in the BNC and in the BNC fn.  
It is clear from the above discussion that the use of corpus methodology in De 
Camargo’s study reveals interesting statistical information about the textual and the 
personal attributes of both the TT translator and OT author. The use of STTR and TTR 
to trace the authorial style of Amado in Rabassa’s translation shows that the two texts 
have different scores, which, as De Camargo argues, indicates the difference between 
	  
	  
	  
33	  
the two styles. However, translation is not a process of linguistic matching of words. 
Thus, style divergence can never be measured simply by means of statistical 
linguistic analysis and comparison of the number of words (Tokens) ad number of 
forms (Types) in the ST and the TT. In other words, the comparison of number of 
types and tokens in both ST and TT does not reveal the extent to which the style of 
the TT diverges from the style of the ST. In addition, only a word-for-word10 
translation of OT would produce a close or similar STTR and TTR. In this regard, 
Baker questions the arguments that translators should reproduce the style of the ST in 
their translations. She indicates that “it is as impossible to produce a stretch of 
language in a totally impersonal way as it is to handle an object without leaving one’s 
finger- prints on it’ (244)”. Thus, comparing STTR and TTR scores of the OT and TT 
can neither reveal the extent to which the translator reproduces the style of the OT 
author nor show the distinctive manner of translating. 
De Camargo’s use of the control corpora, BNC, BNC fn and PB, in her study 
can be questionable. First, she compared STTR and TTR of Rabassa’s translation 
(translational English) to those of the BNC and the BNC fn, which include original 
English texts. One could argue that, comparing STTR and TTR of a translated text to 
the STTR and TTR of non-translated text, BNC and BNC fn in this case, is not a 
useful method of analysis since the two languages have different styles and 
peculiarities. In addition, BNC contains different English text types from different

domains and this could affect the STTR and the TTR analysis. Some genres contain a 
limited number of vocabularies compared to others. De Camargo also makes use of 
PB corpus, which contains Portuguese spoken and written original texts from 
different domains. She compared the STTR and TTR of Amado’s OT to the STTR and 
TTR in PB. She reported that Amado scores higher STTR and TTR compared to the 
PB. This analysis also presents a methodological issue because comparing STTR and 
TTR in a fiction work (Amado’s OT) and in a great number of written and spoken 
texts from different domains (PB corpus) may not reveal accurate results for the 
comparison. Genre or text type and the size of the corpus do affect STTR and TTR 
analysis. 
Marion Winters also used of corpus-based methodology and studies translator 
style by comparing two German translations by Hans-Christian Oeser and Renate 
Orth-Guttmann of the novel The Beautiful and Damned (1998) by Francis Scott 
Fitzgerald. The researcher looked for patterns in the use of modal particles11 by the 
translators. Winters argued that modal particles reveal the micro-level of the 
translators’ linguistic choices. She relied on two methods of analysis to trace the use 
of modal particles in the two translations. First, she used keywords list functionality 
to retrieve the most frequent eight modal particles in the two translations. Then using 
concordance12 search function, Winters retrieved concordance lines of those eight 
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
	  
	  
11In	  German, modal particles are words used in spoken language and in colloquial registers; these words show the 
attitude of the speaker or narrator. 
	  
12	  concordance search functionality shows key words in their immediate context in the corpus	  
	  
	  
	  
35	  
modal particles in the two translations in order to explore the individual style of the 
translators in using them. She then traced the effect of these micro-level linguistic 
choices on the macro-level of the novel. To do so, she referred to the ST by running a 
bilingual concordance search in the two German translations and the ST.  
 Winters found that the two translators have an individual fingerprint when using 
modal particles. The difference between the two translators lies in the frequency and 
in the usage of the modal particles. Using concordance functionality, she analyzed the 
instances of the eight modal particles in the two translations and in the ST. She 
reported that in some instances, the two translators use the same modal particle for 
the same source-text sentence, which she argues is an effect of the ST. In most of the 
cases however, the two translators do not use a modal particle for the same source-
text sentence (82). Winters pointed out that the two translators use modal particles 
differently and that reveals possible differences in the styles of the two translators.  
Winters analyzed the effect of the micro linguistic style of the translators in 
using modal particles on the macro-level of the novel and she pointed out that Oeser’s 
translation is source-text oriented which takes the reader to the ST and its culture. 
Orth-Guttmann’s translation, on the other hand, creates a more casual or colloquial 
tone. It “moves the source text and the author’s world closer to the reader, while 
Oeser expects the reader to move to the source culture/text” (93). Winters concluded 
that the micro-level of the linguistic difference in translators’ style affects the macro-
level of the novel.  
As shown, Winters analyzed the style of the translators in two stages. The first 
	  
	  
	  
36	  
stage encompasses tracing the individual style of the translator by looking for some 
linguistic patterns in the two translations and then compare the two translation to 
trace the differences in style. This stage involves the target text only. The second 
stage includes a bilingual comparison of the ST and the two translations. Winters 
carries out this ST-TT analysis for two reasons: first, to see if the ST has any effects 
on the TT and second, to see the effect of the translator style on the overall effect of 
the novel. Unlike Baker who sees translator style as a recurring pattern of translator’s 
linguistic choice that can be traced in his/her different translations of the same author 
of different authors, Winters sees translator style as a divergence from the ST. 
Winters also discusses the effect of translator style on  the effect of translator style on 
the overall translation. In other word, she looks at why certain ST components are 
translated the way they are and how this translation affects the overall meaning, 
taking into account the relation between the ST and the TT. This approach takes 
translator style analysis a step further by revealing the impact of the translator’s 
individual style on the overall translation of a certain text. This model can be useful 
for conducting a comparative analysis of a number of translations of one source text 
to reveal the individual translator style in each translation. However, this approach 
might not be useful in the case of analyzing the individual style of different 
translators in different translations of different texts. 
Following Baker’s, an interesting study has been conducted by Gabriela 
Saldanha in an attempt to develop a methodology and to propose a working definition 
for translator style. Saldanha makes use of corpus methodology and focuses her 
	  
	  
	  
37	  
approach on looking for some consistent patterns in various works translated by the 
same translators as a way to reveal translator style. To do so, she built three corpora, 
Corpus of Translations by Peter Bush (CTPB) including four translations from 
Spanish (Forbidden Territory: The Memoirs of Juan Goytisolo (1989), Tonight 
(1991), The Wolf, the Woods, The New Man (1995) and The Old Man Who Read Love 
Stories (1993)) and one from Portuguese (Turbulence 1992), Corpus of Translations 
by Margaret Jull Costa (CTMJC) including three translations from Spanish 
(Adventures of the Ingenious Alfanhui (2000), Bedside Manner (1995) and Spring 
Sonata (1997) and two from Portuguese (The Mandarin (1993) and Lúcio’s 
Confession (1993)) and a third corpus of translated works (COMPARA), used as a 
reference corpus. In her analysis she searched for the use of emphatic italics13 and 
foreign words in the TT, which refers to lexical borrowing. She also examined the 
translator’s use of the connective “that” after the reporting verbs “say” and “tell” as a 
distinctive feature of translator style.  
 Saldanha’s study exhibits the limitations noted earlier. The first one is related 
to corpora compilation. Her corpora contain different genres and this, as explained 
earlier, could affect the translator style analysis. The second limitation is related to 
corpus control. CTPB corpus contains translations of works published in 1980 
onwards, whereas the other corpus, CTMJC, contains translations of works published 
in 1880 – 1993. In other words, the first corpus covers works written in a ten-year

38	  
time period and the other one covers works written over 113 years. This could also 
affect translator style analysis. Some of the patterns that may distinguish CTMJC 
corpus from CTPB could be related to a historical period’s writing style or 
conventions.  
 Saldanha also examined the use of the connective “that” after the reporting 
verbs “say” and “tell”. She reported that Bush shows an overall preference for using 
‘zero connective’ while, Jull Costa shows a preference for using optional “that” after 
“say” and “tell”. One could argue that the use of connective “that” after the reporting 
verbs “say” and “tell” might not be a style-marker. This analysis could reveal a 
“distinctive and consistent patterns of choice”(Saldanha 28), but it cannot be used to 
distinguish the translator style from that of others, simply because different translators 
may use “that” after say and “tell” in a similar manner. 
In an interesting study on translator's "fingerprint" or style, Qing Wang and 
Defeng Li added the notion of translator’s authorial style to the discussion. They 
analyzed not only the style of the translator in his/ her translation, but also his/her 
style in his/her creative writing. In their project, they adopted a corpus-based 
approach to trace translator’s fingerprint in two translations of Ulysses into Chinese 
by Qian Xiao (1994) and Di Jin (1997). The researchers built a Bilingual Corpus of 
Ulysses (BCU) consisting of the two translations as well as the original text. They 
also built a comparable subcorpus, reference corpus (RC), which includes Xiao’s 
original writings in Chinese of short stories and novels. The researchers also used this 
corpus to see if there were any instances where the authorial and the translational 
	  
	  
	  
39	  
style of Xiao intersect. The researchers analyzed lexical idiosyncrasy that is the 
individualized habitual use of words. They argued that lexical idiosyncrasy is a style 
marker that reveals the translator style or his/her unique manner of translating. To do 
this lexical analysis, they compared keyword list of the two translations of Ulysses. 
The researchers analyzed high and low frequency words in the two translations and in 
the reference corpus (RC). 
The analysis revealed that Xiao, the literary writer and translator, leaves some 
traces of lexical idiosyncrasy in his translation. The researchers reported that Xiao 
tries to make his translation more emotional and as colloquial as possible, which is 
reflected in his lexical choices. Jin, on the other hand, chooses to use the standard 
Mandarin to make the translation looks more neutral and impersonal (85). The 
researchers also found out that Xiao’s habitual wording style in creative writing has 
an influence on his translation. They argued that the reason might be that the 
translator consciously or subconsciously reverts back to his own language habits, and 
shows a tendency to use preferred expressions over other alternatives (89).  
 Wang and Li  also used the syntactic sequence of sentences (positions of 
clauses) as a style marker to trace the individual style of the two translators in their 
translations. The authors reported that there is a similarity in post-positioned 
adverbial clauses in the two translations, which is, after referring to the ST, a 
reflection of the ST style. As for post-positioned adverbial clause in Xiao’s creative 
writing, the analysis showed that this stylistic feature is more common in Xiao’s 
translation. This feature, they argued, distinguishes the translated text from non-
	  
	  
	  
40	  
translated original writing.  
Wang and Li’s analysis thus indicated that tracing the style of the translators 
by comparing two translations of one source text would revel the distinctive manner 
of translating of the two translators. In addition, comparing two translations of one ST 
to their original would help reveal any instances where the style of the translators is 
impacted by the style of the ST. Wang and Li study is one of the first studies tackling 
the notion of the authorial and the translational style of one translator. However, their 
analysis of translational and authorial style of Xiao is very limited. They analyzed 
only one translation produced by Xiao (Ulysses) and compare it to his creative 
writing of a novel and twenty-three short stories. Wang and Li’s conclusion that the 
authorial wording style has an influence on the translational wording style needs 
further investigation. Using more than one method of analysis to study the 
translational and the authorial style of a particular translator would help reach a more 
solid conclusions, which is what the current study attempts to do by making use of 
methods used in stylometry and authorship attribution studies. 
Like Winters and Wang and Li, Iraklis Pantopoulos analyzed the style of two 
translators in producing translations of one source text. In his study, Pantopoulos 
introduced new style markers to be traced in the analysis of translator style including 
the analysis of function words and contracted forms. In his study, Pantopoulos 
attempted to analyze translator style in two translations of C.P. Cavafy's “The Canon” 
by Rae Dalven (1961) and by Edmund Keeley and Philip Sherrard (1992). He built a 
corpus of the two translations aligned to their source text. He traced stylistic patterns 
	  
	  
	  
41	  
used by the translators by retrieving Type/Token Ratio (TTR), Standardized 
Type/Token Ratio (STTR), number of types and tokens, number of lexical words and 
number of functional words in the two translations. In addition, he traced the 
translator’s use of contraction or contacted forms in the two translations. 
Pantopoulos reported that Dalven uses more tokens and more types compared 
to Keeley and Sherrard. He also found out that both translators exhibit a very similar 
TTR overall. Keeley and Sherrard show higher STTR. As for the lexical (open class) 
and function (closed-class) word analysis, the researcher reported that Dalven uses a 
greater variety of lexical and functional words compared to Keeley and Sherrard. The 
analysis of contractions in the two translations revealed that Dalven uses fewer 
apostrophes in the contracted forms of words in his translation of Cavafy’s “The 
Canon” compared to Keeley and Sherrard in their translations of the same poems 
(100). 
Pantopoulos also carried out a qualitative analysis by comparing the way 
translators translated different terms in the poem and how different translations could 
lead to different meanings. At this stage, he ran the parallel corpus using ParaConc14 
tool, which provides the ability to search terms in a parallel corpus and retrieves 
concordance lines of the source aligned to the target text(s). Pantopoulos found out 
that the two translators have translated some terms differently, which has an impact 
on the meaning of some parts of the TT. He also compared the style of the ST to the

style of the two TTs. He reported that Dalven's version is closer to the structure of the 
ST in both form and effect (102). Keeley and Sherrard, on the other hand, appear to 
follow the structure of the ST more loosely. Pantopoulos discussed translator style as 
unique recurring patterns of a translator’s linguistic choice compared to other 
translator(s) of the same ST and this provides more pertinent analyses than Baker’s 
and Saldanha’s. 
 Other scholars who discuss translator style in his/her creative writing and 
translations include Maeve Olohan. She suggested a model to find the extent to which 
“translated texts display the translator’s linguistic habits” by analyzing “texts written 
by the translators that are not translations” (150). Following Olohan, Claudia Walder 
discussed the style of the translator in his translations of different texts and his/her 
style in creative writing. She tried to see whether there are stylistic similarities and/or 
differences in the two types of texts produced by the same translator. Walder used 
corpus methodology and built three sub-corpora to study the style of Donal 
McLaughlin, an English writer and a German- English translator, in his translation 
and in his creative writing. The first sub-corpus contains McLaughlin’s translations 
from German to English of 52 texts by 47 source text authors. This consists of 29,672 
words. The second sub-corpora include McLaughlin’s original writing from his 
collection of short stories: An Allergic Reaction to National Anthems and Other 
Stories. This corpus contains 20 short stories (61,028 words). The author divides this 
corpus into two sub-corpora of approximately similar length, 1- (ow1) contains 
31,731 2- (ow2) contains 29,297 words. Walder also built a reference corpus 
	  
	  
	  
43	  
consisting of 15 different German text translated into English by 19 different 
translators. As for the data analysis, she used standardized type-token ratio15 (STTR) 
and mean sentence length. The sentence length is the number of words in a sentence. 
She sets the sentence boundaries as a sequence of characters followed by a space and 
an initial capital letter (59). She also looked at the use of dashes and at language 
variation in the two translations. 
The researcher reported that STTR of McLaughlin’s translation is close to that 
in his creative writing. As for mean sentence length, Walder found that sentences 
tends to be longer in the translations of McLaughlin compared to the sentences in his 
creative writing. She also reported that McLaughlin uses more dashes in his creative 
writing. Walder also traced the occurrence of dashes per 1,000 words. She found out 
that the scores of “McLaughlin’s original and translated texts are closer to each other 
than to that of the control corpus” (62). As for language variation, Walder reported 
that McLaughlin uses borrowings from the languages used in Switzerland (German, 
Rumantsch, and Italian) in his translations; this feature is also found in his original 
writings (63). She identified some instances where untranslated German (and French) 
expressions and sentences were used in McLaughlin’s creative writing and she 
concluded that the translational and authorial style of the translator influence each 
other. 
Walder's study is the most granular but some of her parameters may not be 
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
	  
	  
15 STTR is usually calculated for every 1000 words. In this study, the researcher lowers STTR parameter from 1000 
words to 200 and 500 because the average length of the short stories in the translation sub-corpus is 570. 
	  
	  
	  
44	  
useful when it  comes to the analysis of translator style. For instance, sentence length 
analysis may fail because setting the sentence boundaries as a space and an initial 
capital letter would regard “Mr.” in “Mr. Sam is happy.” as sentence. This would 
affect the mean sentence length analysis. It is worth mentioning that using the tittle of 
characters such as Mr. and Mrs. is common in short stories and literature. 
In addition to these text-oriented approaches and translator-oriented 
approaches to style, the emergence of cognitive approaches to translation studies has 
led to the inclusion of cognitive processes in the study of style. In this approach, style 
is considered a cognitive entity that is constructed in the mind of the ST author and in 
the mind of the TT creator. That is, style is a representation of the writer’s mind. 
Consequently, the translator’s task is to capture evidence of the mind in the ST and 
try to recreate it in the TT. The following section discusses the cognitive-approaches 
to the study of style. 
 
2.5. Cognitive-Oriented Approach 
 
The cognitive approach to style, also called cognitive stylistics, has also led to 
recent changes in the study of style. This new approach builds on the concepts of 
cognitive linguistics and emphasizes the relation between text and mind. It looks at 
the style of the source text as a vehicle that conveys and creates a cognitive state or a 
mind style. It argues that the role of the translator is to capture and convey this 
cognitive state in the TT; otherwise the target text will have less effect on its readers' 
	  
	  
	  
45	  
minds (Ghazala 77). Boase-Beier’s book Stylistic Approach to Translation is one of 
the first works to discuss cognitive stylistics in translation studies. She views style as 
a cognitive entity rather than as a purely textual one. Boase-Beier indicates that style 
is determined by the cognitive state of the reader, which is shaped by his/her 
historical, ideological and the cultural background. She argues that a cognitive 
stylistic approach views translators as readers and sees style as a reflection of mind 
and tries to grasp and recreate that mind in the TT.  
Boase-Beier points out that the mind in the text represents a cognitive state, 
which may have two aspects. First, “it is influenced by ideology, it takes a particular 
attitude, or it embodies a particular feeling”. Second, “it carries an attitude conveyed 
by the style” (79). She argues that style conveys this attitude in the text. Thus, it is 
very important that translators understand the mind attitude that appears in the ST. If 
the mind attitude is lost or misunderstood, the translation is affected. Boase-Beier 
argues that the translator should first recognize the cognitive state of the ST in order 
to recreate it in the TT. She points out that if the “translation fails to capture such a 
cognitive state, the target text will have less effect on its readers' minds” (77). Boase-
Beier also indicates that knowledge of style helps translators understand how style 
works and help them interpret stylistic the features of the source text. She points out 
that stylistically aware translation, which begins with a stylistically aware reading of 
the ST, “can make a more reasonable case for its interpretation of the source text than 
any other sort of translation can” (111). She also argues that the TT reader reacts to 
choices made by the translator, which reflect the translator’s cognitive state at the 
	  
	  
	  
46	  
moment of translating. This makes reading a translation different from reading a 
piece of creative writing because translation involves a reflection of two mind states, 
the original author’s and its reflection by the translator in the TT. 
Cognitive stylistics is also discussed by Hasan Ghazala, who applied it to the 
translation of metaphors from English into Arabic. Ghazala neglects the traditional 
view of translating metaphors in terms of creating an equivalent to the ST metaphor 
in the TT. He argues that metaphor should be “understood as a cognitive process that 
conceptualizes people’s minds and thoughts linguistically in similar or different ways 
in languages”. That is, he treats metaphors as a conceptual feature in texts that has 
two domains: the “target domain (the concept to be described by the metaphor), and 
the source domain (the concept drawn upon, or used to create the metaphorical 
construction)” (60). Ghazala argues that all metaphors are reflections and 
constructions of concepts, attitudes, mentalities and ideologies on the part of the 
writer / speaker (57). He adds that speakers or writers do not use metaphors only for 
esthetic purposes; they use them as a vehicle for ideological and cultural concepts, 
meanings and perception of world. From this point, Ghazala calls for 
conceptualization of metaphors of ST in their cultural, political, ideological, social 
and mental environment. Doing so helps translators understand and response to the 
ST metaphors in his/ her translation.  
Ghazala’s cognitive approach to style does not touch upon translation as a 
mental process. It rather takes the conceptualization of some textual parts in texts as a 
key component of discourse comprehension, which is a very important step in 
	  
	  
	  
47	  
creating a TT. Both, Boase-Beier and Ghazala argue that mind of ST author is what 
the translator seeks to render and to recreate in the TT. The mind of the ST author is 
embedded in the style of the text. That is, the translator should try to reveal this mind 
style and convey it in the translation. 
 It is obvious that the cognitive approach to style in translation, as discussed 
by Boase-Beier and Ghazala, has not been well developed yet. This approach does 
not rely on any empirical methods, such as keystroke logging16 or eye tracking17, in 
studying and discussing style in translation. The future of stylistics in translation 
studies may heavily rely on the empirical study of translators' style using cognitive 
approaches.  
 
2.6. Conclusion  
The above discussion of the related literature shows that the development of 
stylistic approaches to translation has been affected by the approaches to the study of 
style in literary studies as well as the different turns in translation studies. The first 
approaches to style in literary studies have focused on texts and have placed a 
minimal emphasis on the ideological and the cognitive dimensions of style in a text. 
This approach has generated a text-oriented comparative view of style in translation 
studies placing more emphasis on the stylistic peculiarities of the ST and on their 
manifestation in the TT. Scholars within the linguistic turn in translation studies

adopted this approach and discussed style in translation as a textual component that 
does not go beyond the linguistic signs in the text. This view reflects the main 
approach of the New Criticism school for which texts are self-referential and self-
contained, while meaning is always inside the text.  
Halliday’s theory of stylistics, which focuses on the importance of the social 
function of the discourse, has also shifted the focus of translational stylistics to take a 
functional turn considering the stylistic function of the TT in its new context (i.e., the 
target culture). This view of style is also text-oriented and does not account for the 
ideological or cognitive components of style; however, it takes the TT culture and its 
norms as a point of departure in the stylistic analysis of translated texts.  
Discourse-analysis approach to literary style, as discussed by Carter and 
Simpson, draws on the critical and close reading of texts to reveal their hidden 
intended meaning that is beyond the physical representation of the signs in the verbal 
discourse. This approach has generated a descriptive method to translational stylistics 
with a focus on the translator’s voice and presence in the TT. The focus on translators 
as cultural agents, has paved the way for translator-oriented approaches to style in 
translation to emerge as a new turn in translational stylistics. In the same manner, the 
reader-oriented theory to literary stylistics, as proposed by Michael Riffaterre, as well 
as the cognitive turn in translation studies, have played a key role in the emergence of 
the cognitive approach to style in translation studies. 
As this literature review makes clear, translation scholars have approached the 
topic differently. Some scholars analyzed translator style by referring to his/her 
	  
	  
	  
49	  
translations of different authors (Saldanha, Baker "Towards a Methodology"), while 
others trace translator style by comparing the changes he/she makes to the target text 
and how these changes could affect the macro-level of the TT (Pantopoulos, Winters). 
Another group of scholars compared different translations of one source text as a way 
to reveal the translator style (Pantopoulos, De Camargo) while a new recent research 
group discussed translator style as a fingerprint that is traceable in his translation and 
creative writing (Walder and Wang and Li). 
Most of the previous works on translator style have used corpus methodology 
to carry out the analysis, but their use of corpus methodology presents some 
limitations related to study design, corpus compilation, control and analysis. As we 
have seen, some researchers analyze translator style in his/her translations of different 
genre and ignored the fact that a number of the stylistic patterns might be a reflection 
of a certain genre18. Other researchers study a translator’s style in his/her translation 
from different languages. As discussed earlier, including texts from different 
languages affects style analysis because some stylistic patters could be related to 
stylistic/ linguistic constraints of a certain language, source language. In addition, the 
design of some of the previous studies is problematic. For instance, comparing 
translated to non-translated text is one of these issues. Comparing a corpus of written 
and spoken text to a translational corpus can also be considered as a flaw in study 
design. The gap between what corpus tools can do and what to consider as a style

marker is one of the main problems in several of the previous studies. In addition, 
building on methods used in previous studies without questioning their viability in 
translator style analysis is another problem. The next chapter attempts to propose a 
methodology and a style-markers’ profile for analyzing translator style.

CHAPTER 3: METHODOLOGY  
3.1. Introduction  
 This chapter discusses the methods used in this study. It also discusses the 
data collection process, corpus compilation and control. As mentioned earlier, the 
study’s principal purpose is to investigate the thematic and stylistic relation between 
Denys Johnson-Davies’s (J-D) creative writing and in his translations in an attempt to 
address existing limitations in current style-related research in translation studies. To 
do so, the study relies on three corpora of short stories produced by him including: 1- 
a corpus of short stories translated by J-D before the production of his own writing; 2- 
a corpus of J-D’s own short stories; and 3- a corpus of short stories J-D translated 
after the production of his own writing. 
 This study uses three computational methods to reveal the thematic and 
stylistic relation between J-D’s creative writings and translations. First, Latent 
Semantic Analysis (LSA) is used as a fully automated method to conduct thematic 
similarity analysis of J-D’s creative writing and translations. This study makes use of 
LSA similarity query, which is an information retrieval technique that is applied to 
Natural Language (NL) understanding problems. This technique relies on the latent 
semantic relation between the concepts and terms in a document to determine the 
similarity between different documents in a corpus and to classify them accordingly. 
This particular method is used to reveal the extent to which the themes in the 
translated short stories are similar to those in J-D’s creative writing.  
	  
	  
	  
52	  
The second computational method makes use of Corpus Stylistics, a sub-field of 
corpus linguistics that uses the application of corpus methods and tools to analyze 
style. Baker defines a corpus as “any collection of running texts, held in electronic 
form and analyzable automatically or semi-automatically (“Corpora in Translation 
Studies”225).” Using corpus stylistics, three style markers will be analyzed including 
Standardized Type-Token Ratio (STTR), Sentence Length and punctuation marks 
(comma, semicolon and hyphen). The third method of analysis applies a machine-
learning Stylometry technique. The machine learning approach to style analysis is one 
of the most advanced approaches in this kind of research. This method is built on the 
notion of Artificial Intelligence (IA) and on the fact that machine, i.e., computer, can 
learn from data. Machine learning style analysis is used in this study to analyze three 
style markers including word n-grams, character n-grams and Part-of-Speech n-
grams. 
The present study applies multiple analysis methods to the same set of data. This 
is known as data analysis triangulation. Analysis triangulation is defined as “a 
situation whereby two or more analysis techniques are used for the same data set” 
(Ziyani, King, and Ehlers 12). In the present study, J-D’s creative writing and 
translations are analyzed using three different methods of analysis to investigate the 
impact and the relation between his translating and creative writing activities. Ashatu 
Hussein argues that the importance of triangulation stems from two facts: it is used 
for “increasing the wider and deep understanding of the study phenomenon, and  it is 
also “used to increase the study accuracy, in this case triangulation is one of the 
	  
	  
	  
53	  
validity measures” (1). Therefore, mixing different analysis methods is used in this 
study to reach a deeper understanding of the interaction between J-D’s authorial and 
translational style and to validate the findings of the methods adopted. The following 
sections provide an overview of the data collection, corpus compilation and control 
and discuss the three analysis methods used in this study.  
 
3.2. Data Collection  
The data of this study include all short stories written and translated by J-D. 
Only short stories are included in this study for two reasons: first, J-D wrote short 
stories and he did not produce any other genre. Second, short stories are used to 
control the corpus for genre. This would help achieve adequate results when 
comparing J-D style in his creative writing and in his translations of short stories.  
Full lists of J-D’s own and translated short stories are provided in appendixes A and 
B.  
3.3. Corpus Database  
The corpus of this study is stored in an Open Office database, an open source 
productivity suite. The database includes the following metadata for each short story: 
translation year, collection title and ID, short story title, publisher, source text author 
and notes. Each collection of short stories has a unique four-character alphanumeric 
identifier (ID). The IDs of the translated collections were predefined as follows: the 
collections translated by J-D before writing his own collection of short stories are 
given TB as a prefix followed by a number; whereas the collections that were 
	  
	  
	  
54	  
translated after writing his short stories are given TA as a prefix followed by a 
number.  
Assigning a predefined ID to each translated short story helps retrieve a list of 
collections and short stories based on their translation date. While entering the titles 
of the short stories in the database, I noticed that some of the translated short stories 
were published in more than one collection. Thus, the database was set in a way that 
does not allow duplicates. When facing a short story that is published in more than 
one collection, a note is entered in the note field in the database. 
 
3.4. Corpus Compilation and Pre-processing 
The first step in corpus compilation is to have all texts in a machine-readable 
format (MRF), which is an electronic format that can be read and analyzed by the 
computer. Most of the short stories that are included in this study are scanned and 
converted into MRF, plaintext format with .txt19 extension, using Optical Character 
Recognition (OCR) tool. This tool converts the scanned images into texts that can be 
read by computers. Other short stories are converted either from a Portable Document 
Format (PDF) or Electronic Publication (ePUB) format into plaintexts. The txt files 
are pre-processed and cleaned to make sure that the body of the texts does not contain 
any running heads, page number, footnotes or any characters that could affect the 
analysis result.  
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
	  
	  
  19 Such	  files	  contain	  very	  little	  or	  no	  formatting.	  This	  format	  of	  text	  is	  used	  to	  make	  sure	  that	  text	  formatting	  
has	  no	  effect	  on	  the	  corpus	  analysis.	  
	  
	  
	  
55	  
The second step involves text selection. As Stamatatos has argued, “any good 
evaluation corpus for authorship attribution [author’s personal style] should be 
controlled for genre and topic” (21). In other words, building a corpus for the purpose 
of analyzing authorial style should consider controlling the corpus for genre and 
topic. Thus, this study controls for genre and only considers short stories translated 
and written by J-D. It also controls for theme and builds three corpora that are, to a 
certain extent, related to each other in theme. LSA Similarity query is used as a 
computerized text selection method to control the corpora for theme. Similarity query 
is discussed in more details in section 3.5.1 LSA Similarity Query. The initial three 
corpora in this study are:

3.5. Latent Semantic Analysis 
As mentioned earlier, Similarity query using Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) 
is used in this study to reveal the thematic relation between the short stories in the 
three corpora and to build two translational sub-corpora that are close in theme to 
those in the creative writing corpus. Before discussing the notion of Similarity query, 
it might be beneficial to provide a definition of LSA and to lay down the main 
processes through which it works. LSA is a “theory and method for extracting and 
representing the contextual-usage meaning of words by statistical computations 
applied to a large corpus of text” (Landauer and Dumais). Landauer, Foltz, and 
Laham argue that LSA is an automated text analysis method that “can approximate 
human judgments of meaning similarity between words and can objectively predict 
the consequence of overall word-based similarity between passages” (5). LSA is 
regarded as an advanced information retrieval method that solves the problems 
caused by synonymy and polysemy. It goes beyond traditional Information Retrieval 
(IR) methods that rely on key word matching techniques and rather “deals with the 
concept, and carries out a search on this basis” (Antai, Fox, and Kruschwitz 161). In 
	  
	  
	  
57	  
retrieving information from textual data, LSA takes advantage of the conceptual and 
semantic content of texts20. LSA makes use of the relation between words and 
concepts to reveal the latent (hidden) relations between words. For instance LSA 
would differentiate Apple the fruit and Apple the Company based on relation of these 
two terms with other terms in the same document. When the word Apple accompanies 
terms such as iMac and OSX, the document is more likely describing Apple Company, 
whereas, when the term Apple accompanies other terms such as calories and fruit, the 
document is more likely discussing a topic related to the fruit. 
The LSA relies on complex mathematical algorithms that convert texts into 
matrices to do the analysis, which goes through several steps. The first step in the 
LSA analysis is matrix creation (term-document matrix) including terms and 
documents in a target corpus21. In this matrix the terms are placed on the rows and the 
documents on the columns. The entries in the matrix are the frequencies of each term 
in a corresponding document. The following figure shows three documents and their 
terms in a matrix: 
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
	  
	  
20	  The LSA method works by categorizing terms and concepts in a document in what is called a “concept space”. That 
is, related terms will be mapped onto their concept space and other concepts can be retrieved from a particular concept. LSA 
uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to create this concept space. (Antai, Fox, and Kruschwitz 161). SVD is a 
mathematical technique for dimensionality reduction. That is, given a large vector space, SVD attempts to reduce the number of 
dimensions in the space by combining terms (this process is explained in the following paragraphs). This allows patterns to be 
revealed between terms and concepts in a corpus of (un)structured documents.

FIGURE 1:  MATRIX OF MADE UP DOCUMENTS 
 
The first document in the above matrix, Doc 1, is more likely to discuss topics related 
to Kent State, the educational institution. While, the second document, Doc 2, is more 
likely to discuss topics related to Kent, a city in the United Kingdom.  
 The matrix creation process is followed by a pre-processing step, which 
includes stop word removal, and assignments of weights to terms (Antai, Fox, and 
Kruschwitz 162). An important step in using LSA is creating a stop words list 
containing propositions, conjunctions, articles and names. The importance of 
including such a list stems from the fact that LSA should capture the relation between 
meaningful words in order to reach a good level of accuracy. Term weight depends 
on the score or the frequency of terms in a set of documents and on applying Singular 
Value Decomposition (SVD)22 on the term-document matrix as a method for data 
reduction. SVD captures the strong relations between terms and removes other terms 
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
	  
	  
22	  SVD takes “a high dimensional, highly variable set of data points and reducing it to a lower dimensional space that 
exposes the substructure of the original data more clearly and orders it from most variation to the least” (K. Baker 16). To do so, 
SVD takes term-document matrix, X, and decomposes it into three matrices including “[o]ne component matrix describes the 
original row entities [of X] as vectors of derived orthogonal factor values, another describes the original column entities in the 
same way, and the third is a diagonal matrix containing scaling values such that when the three components are matrix-
multiplied, the original matrix is reconstructed” (Landauer, Foltz, and Laham 8).

with unimportant value to the document. In other words, it reconstructs the initial 
matrix by only including terms that have a strong relation with other terms in the 
document. Then, each document is represented as a vector 23in a dimensional space 
and the similarity between words and/or documents is computed by measuring the 
similarity between their vectors (see Figure 2: Made up documents in 2-dimensional 
space). Usually, the cosine of the angle between the vectors in Dim-space is used to 
determine this similarity between terms and between documents. The following 
figure explains this process:  
FIGURE 2: MADE UP DOCUMENTS IN 2-DIMENSIONAL SPACE  
 
In the above figure, five documents are represented in vectors (Doc1, Doc2, Doc3,

Doc4, Doc5). The distance between vectors represents the distance between terms 
and concepts in the documents from other concepts and terms in other documents. 
The similarity between documents is measured by the closeness of vectors from each 
other. LSA measures the angle between the vectors (which represent documents) in a 
dimensional space, Dim, to determine their similarity. The closer the vectors from 
each other the more similar they are. For instance, Doc 1 is more like Doc 4 
compared to Doc 2.  
 
3.5.1. LSA Similarity Query 
 LSA similarity query or similarity analysis is one of the LSA applications, 
which is used to determine the thematic similarity between a query document and a 
number of other documents in specific corpora/ corpus. A query document is like a 
query term that a user enters in Google.com search bar; however, the query document 
is a whole document that can be thousands of words long. The following figure 
explains this process:

LSA similarity query is used in this dissertation to retrieve the most thematically 
relevant translated short stories to their counterparts in the creative writing corpus.  
The most thematically relevant short stories (in the two translational corpora) to each 
query document (to each creative writing short story) will be retrieved to build 
(TBCRW) and (TACRW).  
 The One-to-many24approach is followed to apply similarity query on the 
corpora of this study. This approach takes a single document as a query document 
(each single short story from the creative writing corpus (CRW)), compares it to a 
number of other documents in a target corpus, (TACRW_raw) and (TBCRW_raw) in 
this case, and then retrieves the document(s) that are most thematically relevant to the 
initial query document (creative writing short story). See Figure 4 below: 
FIGURE 4: ONE-TO-MANY SIMILARITY QUERY PROCESS 
 
This process results in the creation of the two translational sub-corpora (TACRW and 
TBCRW), which are used in the second and third data analysis methods, namely: 
corpus analysis and machine learning.

universities such as Colorado University at Boulder. (see http://lsa.colorado.edu/cgi-bin/LSA-one2many.html)

3.5.2. LSA Similarity Cutoff 
The output of the LSA analysis provides the similarity degree of the query document 
to the other documents in the corpus by providing the cosine value of the angle 
between their vectors. The researcher should determine the similarity degree or the 
cosine value, which is the value of the cosine angle	  above which the retrieved 
document is considered relevant to the query document. Scholars indicate that that 
there is no defined rule for determining this value, however, most studies reported 
that this value occurs between 0.65—0.70 (Graesser et al., Penumatsa et al.). The 
present study sets the similarity value to 0.70 and considers the translated short story 
to be similar to the creative writing short story if their vectors have a cosine value of 
0.70 or greater (See Table 5 page 84 for an example of LSA output). 
 
3.5.3. LSA Output Evaluation  
 The LSA output is evaluated manually. This manual evaluation includes 
reading each query short story (from the creative writing corpus) and its first five 
thematically relevant translated short stories as retrieved by the LSA analysis. This 
would give the researcher the chance to evaluate the LSA results and to know the 
kind of themes, characters and settings in the three corpora (TBCRW, CRW, and 
TACRW). 
 
3.6. Corpus Stylistics  
	  
	  
	  
63	  
 The second method that is used in this study adopts a corpus stylistic 
approach, which is a corpus-based approach that makes use of computational methods 
to analyze style in a collection of digital texts. Corpus Stylistics relies on the 
statistical analysis of style based on frequencies of some stylistic features or style 
markers such as sentence length and word length. This study traces the stylistic 
influence of J-D’s translating activity on his creative writing and vice versa by 
analyzing three style marks (Standardized Type-Token Ratio, Mean Sentence Length 
and Punctuation Marks) in the three corpora produced by J-D (translation before 
creative writing, creative writing and translation after creative writing). To do so, 
WordSmith (WS) tool (Scott), a corpus analysis tool that provides the ability to 
retrieve stylistic statistical information from digital texts, is used in this study. The 
corpus analysis output of WS is also tested using one-way independent samples 
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) to compare the effect of text production activity 
(translation before creative writing, creative writing and translation after creative 
writing) on the three style markers (Standardized Type-Token Ratio, Mean Sentence 
Length and Punctuation Marks). The following sections explain the three style 
markers analyzed in this study as well as the statistical analysis applied on the data. 
 
3.6.1. Standardized Type-Token Ratio (STTR)  
 Type-Token Ratio (TTR) reveals what is called lexical density or 
vocabulary richness by calculating the ratio of types (words without repetition) and 
tokens (the overall number of words in a document) in a specific text. In other words, 
	  
	  
	  
64	  
it measures the “diversity of vocabulary used by a writer, or in a given corpus” (250). 
STT analysis is affected by text length; it is used to measure vocabulary richness in 
equal-sized corpora. However, it becomes useless if the corpora in the study are not 
of an equal size. On the other hand, Standardized Type-Token Ratio (STTR) is used 
when the corpora under study are not of an equal size. STTR calculates the average 
TTR based on consecutive word chunks of a text; it calculates, for example, the TTR 
in each consecutive 500 or 1000 tokens (Kubát and Milička 341).  
 
3.6.2. Mean Sentence Length 
 Mean sentence length is the average number of words in a sentence. As 
Udny Yule argues, “it has been approved in the literature that sentence length or 
number of words per sentence is a characteristic of an author’s style” ( 370). Jon 
Patton and Fazil Can also use sentence length as a style marker, among others, to 
analyze authorial style. Their result reveals that using "sentence lengths" as a style 
marker is one of the best style markers that helps distinguish author’s style. A 
sentence is defined in Wordsmith tool’s User Guide as “the full-stop, question-mark 
or exclamation-mark (.?!) and immediately followed by one or more word separators 
and then a number or a currency symbol, or a letter in the current language which isn't 
lower-case” (Scott 317). The analysis of mean sentence length in this dissertation was 
preceded by “find short sentence” method. It is a function in the Wordsmith tool that 
lists all short sentences. The importance of applying “find short sentence” method 
before measuring the mean sentence length lies in making sure that sentences such as 
	  
	  
	  
65	  
“I like Mr. John.” are not considered as two sentences. The “Find short sentence” 
method makes it possible to trace all the forms that may affect sentence length 
analysis and convert them to forms that have no effect on sentence length analysis. 
For example, this method retrieves a form such as “Mr.” as a sentence, the researcher 
manually removes the period in “Mr.” to make it “Mr”. This will make the tool 
consider “Mr” as a word and not a sentence. 
 
3.6.3. Punctuation marks 
 Li, Zheng, and Chen argue that “incorporating punctuation frequency as a 
feature can improve the performance of authorship identification [style analysis]” 
(80). In order to apply punctuation marks analysis, three punctuation marks are 
analyzed in this dissertation: semicolon, comma and hyphen. Punctuation marks 
analysis using corpus-based methods relies on frequency scores of punctuation marks 
in a given corpus. However, since text size could affect this kind of analysis and 
given the fact that the size of the three corpora in this study is not equal, the 
frequency of each punctuation mark is calculated per 1000 words (standardized 
punctuation marks analysis). Therefore, text size as a variable will not have any effect 
on the punctuation markers analysis. 
 
3.7. Statistical Testing  
	  
	  
	  
66	  
Statistical analyses were conducted using Statistical Package for the Social 
Sciences (SPSS version 22; SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) to determine if there was a 
significant difference between the mean scores of the three style-markers under three 
conditions (Translation Before Creative Writing, Creative Writing, and Translation 
After Creative Writing). To do so, one-way independent samples Analysis of 
Variance (ANOVA) was used. ANOVA is a type of statistical tests that is used to 
analyze the difference between the means of groups in a specific study to determine if 
there is any statistical difference between them. When there is a significant difference 
between the means of the compared groups, ANOVA does not provide information 
on which group is different form the other. In this case, a post-hoc statistical analysis 
should be used to determine which means are significantly different from each other. 
The present study applies Tukey HSD (Honest Significant Difference) test, which is a 
post-hoc statistical test applied after the ANOVA test. Tukey HSD is applied when the 
ANOVA test reveals that there is a significant different between the means of the 
groups. The Tukey HSD helps reveal which groups are significantly different from 
each other.  
3.8. Machine Learning Approach 
 The third method used in this study to analyze J-D’s translational and 
authorial style makes use of machine learning stylometry. Machine learning approach 
to style analysis is one of the most advanced methods in this field. This method goes 
beyond the statistical methods of style analysis, such as corpus stylistics. It relies on 
artificial intelligence and what is called automatic pattern recognition, which is the 
	  
	  
	  
67	  
ability of the machine to learn the style of text producer by training the machine on a 
corpus of text written by a specific author (Ramyaa, Rasheed, and He). Machine-
learning stylometric analysis is conducted in five main stages. The first stage involves 
feeding the machine, i.e. the computer, with a training corpus of texts written by a 
specific author. The machine is trained on the style of the training corpus author by 
analyzing his/her style based on machine learning algorithms and a predefined set of 
style marker(s). This training stage results in building the authorial stylistic profile of 
the training corpus author25. The third stage of machine learning stylometric analysis 
involves querying the machine whether or not a specific text, a text written by an 
unknown author, is written by the same training corpus author. At this stage, the 
machine analyzes the text that was written by an unknown author and builds a 
stylistic profile of this text. Finally the machine compares the two stylistic profiles (of 
the training data author and of the text with unknown author) and decides whether the 
author of the training data is the same author or the query text. 
 Machine learning approach to style analysis has been used and tested in 
several studies (Luyckx and Daelemans and Elayidom et al.) investigating the 
personal style of authors and most studies reported that this method is viable and very 
useful for investigating authorial style. Machine learning stylometry is used in this 
study to determine which of J-D’s text production activities (translation before 
creative writing, creative writing and translation after creative writing) is stylistically 
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
	  
	  
25	  This stage is also called automated pattern recognition, which involves training the machine to learn the style of 
text producer based on some stylistic patterns in the training corpus (Ramyaa, Rasheed, and He).	  
	  
	  
	  
68	  
close to the other. In the machine learning experiments, J-D’s translations before 
creative writing (TBCRW) and after creative writing (TACRW) are used as training 
corpora. The creative writing short stories (CRW) are used as query documents in 
order to reveal the extent to which the authorial stylistic profile of J-D in his creative 
writing is close to his translational stylistic profiles in the translations produced 
before and after creative writing (See Figure 13 on page 109). The stylometric 
analysis of J-D’s translations and creative writings is based on the analysis of three 
style markers including:  
 
3.8.1. Character n-grams 
 Oakes & Ji (2012) define character n-gram as “a sub-sequence of n 
characters from a given word (153). For example, the 2-gram or the 2-subsequent 
characters of the word happy will be “ha”, “ap”, “pp”, “py”. Jack Grieve compared 
the feasibility of word frequency, punctuation marks and character n-gram for style 
analysis purposes. He reported that character n-gram is one of the most effective 
measures to reveal the style of the document’s author. John Houvardas and 
Stamatatos indicated that “character n-grams are able to capture complicated stylistic 
information on the lexical, syntactic, or structural level” (78). They pointed out that 
character 3-grams analysis could reveal lexical information such as [/the/ /_to/], 
word-class [/ing/, /ed] or punctuation usage (/._X/, /_“X/) information (Houvardas 
and Stamatatos 78). The current study uses charcter n-gram with n=3 in order to 
allow a deeper stylistic analysis. Since the chracter n-gram method is able to reveal 
	  
	  
	  
69	  
information related punctuation mark usage, this method would help validating the 
coprus analysis of punctuation marks. 
 
3.8.2. Part of Speech (POS) n-grams  
 Part of Speech (POS) analysis depends on the analysis of the tagged part of 
a speech element. For this particular type of analysis two tools are needed. The first 
one is POS tagger, which is a software that reads texts in a certain language and 
assigns parts of speech to each word. The second tool is a corpus analysis tool that 
analyzes the tagged text depending on the research questions. POS analysis tends to 
capture the syntactic style of the document writer. Patrick Juola indicates that there is 
a general agreement in authorship attributions literature that POS tags are good 
features to include in any style related studies. He also argues that “methods that do 
not use syntax in one form or another, either through the use of word n-grams or 
explicit syntactic coding tend to perform poorly” (320). The importance of using POS 
tags stems from the fact that authors tend to use similar syntactic patterns 
unintentionally in their different writings. Several researchers such as Argamon-
Engelson, Koppel, and Avneri; Zhao and Zobel have used POS tags n-gram as a way 
to study authorial style and have reported that this style-marker gives quite accurate 
results. 
As for the analysis of POS tags in this study, 2, 3, 4gram POS tags were 
considered. Since the target language syntactic conventions could impact the 
syntactic style of the J-D in his translation and the creative writing, a fourth control 
	  
	  
	  
70	  
corpus, containing fifteen short stories written originally in English during the period 
(1940-2012), is used. The control corpus is used to ensure that syntactic conventions 
of the target language have no influence on the analysis of J-D’s syntactic style. 
In order to perform POS analysis, this study automatically tagged the three initial 
corpora using Stanford Log-linear Part-Of-Speech Tagger. This tagger gives 97.24% 
accuracy in tagging texts (Toutanova et al.). In producing the tags, this tagger uses the 
Penn Treebank tag set, shown in Table 2 below:

3.8.3. Word n-grams 
 Word n-gram shows the most frequent n-grams in a document depending on 
the size of the gram n. For instance a bigram list consists of the most frequent two 
words that come together. Stamatatos, Fakotakis, and Kokkinakis and Kim and 
Walter use word n-grams, reporting that word n-gram analysis is a good method to 
study the style of a document author. In the same way, Raghavan, Kovashka, and 
Mooney apply the n-gram model to study authorship attribution. In their study, they 
report that the best performing n-gram is the 3-gram model with an accuracy of 
98.34%. Within translation studies, the idea of using word n-gram in analyzing 
translated texts is discussed by Dorothy Kenny. She refers to word n-gram as word 
clusters indicating that retrieving and analyzing two or three-word clusters help 
reveal different types of patterns in translated texts. These patterns can be related to 
the style of a translated text or to the style of the translator (42, 138). Similarly, 
Michaela Mahlberg uses the term word cluster to refer to word n-gram. She uses 
word cluster to analyze Dickens’ style in his fiction. The present study uses the term 
word n-gram to refer to word cluster analysis.  While applying word n-gram, the 
researcher should decide on the size of the n, which varies from one study to another. 
As for the present study, n-gram is applied with n=, 3 and 4 to see which n-gram 
model works better in the case of the authorial and translational style. Word n-gram 
has been also used for “topic discovery” or “topic modeling”, which is a natural 
language processing technique that is used to reveal the topic or theme of a specific 
set of documents and classify them accordingly (Wang, McCallum, and Wei). Word 
	  
	  
	  
73	  
n-gram analysis would help reveal lexical patterns in J-D’s translations and creative 
writing and would also help validate the Latent Semantic Analysis results (LSA)26.  
 
3.9. Tools Used in the Dissertation 
Three tools are used to analyze the data in this study. The first one is Gensim tool, an 
open source topic-modeling tool that is implemented in the Python programing 
language. The second tool is WordSmith, a windows-based tool used in corpus 
linguistics. The third tool is JGAAP (Java Graphical Authorship Attribution 
Program), a free machine-learning stylometry tool. Table 3 below provides a

which is an NLP technique where word order is not important. On the contrary, word n-gram analysis relies on word order and 
the co-occurrences of words in a text. The two techniques use different analysis methods to reveal the thematic content of a text.

3.10. Conclusion 
 This chapter has provided detailed information about data collection, and 
corpus preprocessing, compilation, control and analysis. It has also discussed the 
three computational methods used in this study (Latent Semantic Analysis, Corpus 
Stylistics and Machine Learning Stylometry) while showing the purpose behind using 
each method. This chapter has also discussed a set of style markers that were 
analyzed using each method to conduct the data analysis. The following chapter 
discusses the processes and the results of applying Latent Semantic Analysis on the 
three corpora in this study: the corpus of translated short stories produced before the 
production of creative writing (TBCRW_raw), the corpus of creative writing short 
stories (CRW) and the corpus of translated short stories produced after the production 
of creative writing (TACRW_raw).

CHAPTER 4: LATENT SEMANTIC ANALYSIS RESULTS   
4.1.  Introduction 
 This chapter presents the results of the LSA experiments on the three short 
stories corpora produced by J-D: the corpus of translated short stories produced 
before the production of creative writing (TBCRW_raw), the corpus of creative 
writing short stories (CRW) and the corpus of translated short stories produced after 
the production of creative writing (TACRW_raw). The chapter is divided into three 
sections; the first section provides a general overview of the LSA experiment applied 
to the three corpora in this study (TBCRW_raw, CRW and TACRW_raw). The 
second section shows the results of the first LSA experiment concerning the thematic 
similarity of the translated short stories in (TBCRW_raw) to their counterparts in J-
D’s creative writing (CRW) while the third section discusses the thematic similarity 
of creative writing short stories (CRW) to the short stories translated after the 
production of the creative writing (TACRW_raw). This chapter relies on data 
visualization as a method for data representation. A number of charts are provided in 
each section to demonstrate visualizations of the LSA experiments, processes and 
results.  
 The first LSA experiment described and reported in this chapter is meant to 
test the third hypothesis, which claims that the short stories J-D translated before the 
production of creative writing are close in theme to his creative writing short stories. 
The second LSA experiment tests the fourth hypothesis, which claims that J-D’s own 
short stories are close in theme to the short stories he translated after the production 
	  
	   	   79	  
of his creative writing. As discussed in the methodology chapter, LSA Similarity 
analysis is used to reveal if the themes J-D developed in his creative writing were 
influenced by the themes of the short stories he translated before the production of his 
creative writing. This analysis is also used to determine if the themes in J-D’s creative 
writing impacted his choice of the short stories translated after the production of 
creative writing. 
 
4.2. LSA Similarity Analysis 
As pointed out in the methodology chapter, LSA is a fully automated 
computational method that applies mathematical algorithms to retrieve and represent 
the contextual meaning and usage of words. The power of LSA analysis lies in the 
fact that it “approximate[s] human judgments of meaning similarity between words 
and can objectively predict the consequence of overall word-based similarity between 
passages” (Landauer, Foltz, and Laham). Several scholars, such as Thomas Landauer, 
Foltz, and Laham; Thomas Hofmann, T. L. Griffiths and Steyvers; T. Griffiths and 
Steyvers, “Prediction and Semantic Association” indicate that automated document 
similarity analysis is very useful in many cases such as structuring a huge corpus of 
texts based on topics. The applicability of LSA in similarity analysis queries is 
empirically proved with excellent rates of accuracy (Deerwester et al.; Ahat, Amor, 
and Bui). When it comes to the study of translator style using computational methods, 
LSA similarity analysis can be effectively used to build a corpus of translated texts 
that is controlled for topic. As mentioned earlier, LSA similarity analysis is used in 
	  
	   	   80	  
this study to retrieve the most thematically relevant short stories J-D translated before 
the production of his creative writing (TBCRW_raw) and the short stories he 
translated after the production of creative writing (TACRW_raw) to their counterparts 
in the creative writing corpus (CRW). The following sections explain this process and 
report the result of applying this method on the three corpora in the present study.  
 
4.2.1. LSA Similarity Query on J-D’s Translation before Creative Writing 
In this experiment, the fifteen short stories written by J-D (CRW corpus) are 
used as query documents to retrieve the most relevant short stories in the first 
translational sub-corpora (TBCRW_raw), containing the short stories J-D translated 
before writing his own short stories. The most relevant five short stories to each query 
document (creative writing short story) were retrieved to build (TBCRW), which 
contains short stories translated by J-D and is relevant in topic to the creative writing 
corpus. The following figure shows this process:

As mentioned in the methodology chapter, the present study makes use of the 
Gensim27 tool to run the LSA experiment. It is worth noting that LSA analysis using 
Gensim requires preprocessing the corpus in a specific way. That is, each corpus is 
saved in one txt file containing a number of lines that equals the number of different 
short stories in each corpus. In other words, each line contains one short story. The 
first corpus, CRW, which contains fifteen creative writing short stories, is converted 
into a 15-lines txt file. Similarly, the short stories TBCRW_raw is converted into one 
txt file containing two hundred and sixteen lines, which reflects the number of short 
stories J-D translated before writing his own collection of short stories, as the Table  4 
below shows: 
TABLE 4: CRW AND TBCRW_RAW SIZE 
 CRW TBCRW_raw 
Number of lines/ 
documents 
15 216 
 
The second step in the LSA analysis requires pre-processing the corpus by applying a 
stoplist on the data. The stoplist contains words such as prepositions and articles that 
have less lexical meaning compared to content words such as verbs or nous. The 
importance of including such a list stems from the fact that LSA should capture the 
relation between meaningful words in order to reach a good level of accuracy. After 
pre-processing the corpus using the stoplist, LSA represents the corpus documents in

a vector format within a dimensional space (See Figure 2 page 59). The size of the 
vector containing the number of latent themes based on which the similarity 
experiment is conducted, must be determined. The thematic similarity or relevancy 
between documents in a specific corpus is determined by calculating the cosine angle 
between their vectors. In the literature, different researchers used different 
dimensionality in their experiments (Nakov). Typically, to choose the vector value, 
one runs experiments with different values (e.g., 50, 100, 200 or 300), depending on 
the research questions and the corpus size in the study, and then selects the value that 
gives the most accurate results. In this experiment, LSA was run with V= 75, 100, 
15028. A manual evaluation of the three LSA outputs showed that the overall results 
had not changed when changing the V value. Thus, the output of the LSA with V=100 
was selected since it is the value between 75 and 150. 
 
4.2.1.1. LSA Results with V=100 
 Table 5 below displays the LSA output of the experiment featuring the five 
most thematically relevant short stories translated before the production of creative 
writing to each creative writing short story in (CRW). The table also shows the cosine 
value of the angle between the vectors of the translated short stories from 
(TBCRW_raw) and the vector of the creative writing short stories (CRW).

creative writing short stories are represented as Q (1—15). The Doc column lists the 
short story number that was translated by J-D after the production of his creative 
writing in the first translational corpus (TBCRW_raw). The similarity column shows 
the cosine value of the angle between the vectors of the translated short story (Doc 
column) and the creative writing short story (Q1—15). For example, Q-1 is short 
story number one in the creative writing corpus. Doc number 166 represents the 
translated short story number one hundred and sixty six in the translational corpus 
(TACRW_raw). The similarity column shows the cosine value of the angle between 
the vector of the translated short story number one hundred and sixty six in 
(TACRW_raw) and the vector of the short story number one in the creative writing 
corpus (CRW), which is 0.63. 
	  
	   	   84	  
TABLE 5: LSA OUTPUT OF SIMILARITY QUERY ANALYSIS ON TBCRW_RAW 
	  
 
As explained in the methodology chapter, the similarity cutoff for this experiment is 
set to 0.70. The similarity cutoff value determines the cosine value between two 
vectors above which the translated short story is considered thematically similar to 
the short stories in the creative writing corpus. Thus, any short story with less than 
0.70 cosine value is considered less thematically relevant to the creative writing short 
story. Based on the pre-defined cosine value cutoff, the tables above show that none 
of the translated short stories that J-D produced before engaging in his creative 
	  
	   	   85	  
writing has a significant thematic similarity to the themes of his own writing. The 
exposition of the LSA findings in a table format might not provide an easy read of the 
results. Therefore, the following graphs offer a visualization of the LSA results in

The above graphs visualize the results of the LSA queries and demonstrate the 
relation between the short stories J-D translated before the production of his creative 
writing and (TBCRW_raw) and the creative writing sort stories in (CRW). Q1—Q15 
are used to refer to the process of using the fifteen creative writing short stories as a 
query documents. The blue rectangles represent the translated short stories from 
(TBCRW_raw). In each query, the first five results, which represent the five 
translated short stories most thematically relevant to the creative writing short stories, 
are presented in the graphs above.  It can be noticed that none of the translated short 
stories that were translated before the production of J-D’s creative writing fall in the 
similarity cutoff space in the three graphs; however, some translated short stories are 
more thematically relevant than other translated short stories in the same corpus 
(TBCRW_raw) to the creative writing stories in (CRW).  
 
4.2.2. LSA Similarity Query on J-D’s Translation after Creative Writing  
 The second LSA experiment reported in this section attempts to reveal the 
thematic similarity between J-D’s creative writing and the translated short stories 
produced after the production of the creative writing short stories. The most 
thematically similar five short stories in the second translational corpus containing 
short stories translated after the production of creative writing (TACRW_raw) in 
relation to each creative writing short story (CRW) are retrieved. The output of this 
LSA experiment will be used to build (TBCRW) corpus, which contains the fifteen 
most thematically relevant short stories translated by J-D after the production of his 
	  
	   	   88	  
creative writing. The following figure shows this process: 
FIGURE 9: LSA ANALYSIS OF TACRW_RAW 
 
As with the previous experiment, TACRW_raw was saved in a txt file containing one 
hundred and seven short stories. Each short story is presented in a separate line (See 
table 3 below). The stoplist was then applied on the two corpora (CRW and 
TACRW_raw).  
 
TABLE 6: CRW AND TACRW_RAW SIZE 
 CRW TACRW_raw

stories

 As for Vector value, the second LSA experiment was run with two vector 
values: V =25 and V =50, considering the size of the corpus. It is worth mentioning 
that determining the V value depends on the size of the corpus. Since (TACRW_raw) 
is smaller than (TBCRW_raw), the V value will logically be lower than the V value of 
the first LSA experiment considering the size of the two corpora. After a manual 
evaluation of the LSA analysis results with V = 50 and V =100, I noticed that the

overall results had not changed when changing the V value. However, the cosine 
value decreased when setting the experiment with a higher V value although the 
number of the relevant short stories remained the same. For consistency purposes, I 
selected V =50 which represent almost half the number of the short stories in the 
(TACRW_raw). The same principle was applied in the first experiment where V 
value was set to 100, which is half the number of short stories in (TBCRW_raw). 
 
4.2.2.1. LSA Results with V=50 
 The following table display the LSA output of the experiment featuring the 
five most thematically relevant short stories translated after the production of creative 
writing to the creative writing short stories (CRW). The table also shows the cosine 
value of the angle between the vectors of the translated short stories from 
(TACRW_raw) and the vector of the creative writing short stories (CRW). The 
creative writing short stories are represented as Q (1—15). The Doc column lists the 
short story number that was translated by J-D after the production of his creative 
writing in the second translational corpus (TACRW_raw). The similarity column 
shows the cosine value of the angle between the vectors of the translated short story 
(Doc column) and the creative writing short stories (Q1—15). For example, Q-1 
represents short story number one in the creative writing corpus. Doc number 28 
represents the translated short story number twenty-eight in the translational corpus 
(TACRW_raw). The similarity column shows the cosine value of angle between the 
vector of the translated short story number twenty-eight in (TACRW_raw) and the 
	  
	   	   90	  
vector of the short story number one in the creative writing corpus (CRW), which is 
0.73.

	   	   91	  
 
 Based on the pre-defined similarity cutoff (cosine value ≥ 0.70), Table 7 
above shows that many of the translated short stories that J-D produced after 
engaging in his creative writing have a significant thematic similarity to themes in his 
own writing. The following graphs in particular demonstrate the thematic similarity 
between the creative writing short stories and the translated short stories that were 
translated after the production of the creative writing short stories (in TACRW_raw):

 The above graphs visualize the results of the LSA queries and demonstrate 
the thematic relation between the short stories in both corpora (CRW and 
TACRW_raw). Each graph represents five creative writing short stories (Q1—Q5, 
Q6—10, Q11—Q15) and shows their most thematically relevant counterparts in the 
translational corpus (TACRW_raw). The triangles in the above graphs represent the 
translated short stories from (TACRW_raw). It can be noticed that a number of 
translated short stories fall within the similarity cutoff space in the three graphs. It can 
also be observed that only four translated short stories are relevant to the fifteen 
creative writing short stories. 
 
4.3. Conclusion  
 According to the findings, the first LSA experiment on the relation between 
(TBCRW_raw) and (CRW) revealed that there was no significant thematic similarity 
between the short stories translated by J-D before the production of his creative 
writing and his creative writing short stories. On the other hand, the second LSA 
experiment revealed that there is a significant thematic similarity between the short 
stories translated after the production of creative writing short stories (TACRW_raw) 
and the creative writing ones in (CRW). These findings will be further discussed in 
Chapter 6 in the light of the research hypotheses that motivated this study. The 
following chapter offers a second set of experiments that made use of corpus stylistic 
and machine learning stylometry methods to investigate a selection of style markers 
specific to J-D’s translations and creative writings.  
	  
	   	   94	  
CHAPTER 5: CORPUS STYLISTICS AND MACHINE LEARNING 
ANALYSIS RESULTS  
 
5.1. Introduction 
 This chapter is divided into two parts. The first part reports the corpus 
analysis results as derived from the WordSmith tool. It also reports the results of the 
one-way independent samples Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). The second part 
reports the results of the machine learning experiments. The corpus and the machine 
learning experiments described in this chapter are meant to test the third hypothesis, 
which claims that the short stories J-D translated before the production of creative 
writing display some stylistic markers that are also found in his creative writing. 
These two experiments also address the fourth hypothesis, i.e., J-D’s creative writing 
short stories display some stylistic markers that are also found in the short stories he 
translated after the production of creative writing The corpora analyzed in this chapter 
are built based on the results of the two LSA experiments that were conducted in the 
previous chapter. That is, the chapter analyzes a set of short stories translated by J-D 
before and after the production of his creative writing and which are thematically 
relevant to his creative writing short stories. This include the following corpora:

5.2. Corpus Analysis 
This section applies a corpus-based approach to translator style and analyzes 
J-D’s style in the corpus of short stories translated before the production of creative 
writing (TACRW), the corpus of Creative Writing short stories (CRW) and the 
corpus of short stories translated after the production of creative writing (TACRW). 
The stylistic analysis in this section focuses on some style-markers including 
Standardized Type-Token Ratio (STTR), mean sentence length and punctuation 
marks (commas, hyphens and semicolons). The goal of this analysis is to trace the 
stylistic impact of J-D’s translating activity on his creative writing activity and in turn 
see if the creative writing activity has any stylistic impact on J-D’s translating 
activity. The following sections report the corpus analysis results of the three style 
markers. 
 
5.2.1. Textual Analysis 
5.2.1.1. Standardized Type-Token Ratio  
 STTR reveals the degree of vocabularies diversity in a text or the 
vocabulary richness of the text producer. As mentioned earlier, STTR has been used 
	  
	   	   96	  
as a style marker to analyze translators and authors style. This section provides the 
STTR results of three corpora produced by J-D. The following table displays the 
STTR analysis results of the three corpora in this study (TBCRW, CRW, and 
TACRW). The STTR results in Table 9 below are based on textual chunks of 50029 
words. 
TABLE 9: STTR SCORE IN THE THREE CORPORA 
 
 The above table shows the mean STTR in J-D’s translation before creative 
writing (TBCRW), in J-D’s creative writing (CRW) and in J-D’s translation after 
creative writing (TACRW). It can be noticed that there is not a significant difference 
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
	  
	  
29	  	   The	   STTR	   analysis	   in	   this	   study	   was	   set	   to	   500	   because	   one	   of	   the	   short	   stories	   J-­‐D	   translated	   after	   the

this	  specific	  short	  story	  unless	  the	  STTR	  is	  measured	  for	  each	  500	  words.	  
	  
	   	   97	  
between the mean score of STTR in the translations that J-D produced before and 
after the production of his creative writing (TBCRW and TACRW). However, there 
is a noticeable difference between the mean score of STTR in the two translational 
corpora (TBCRW and TACRW) and the creative writing corpus (CRW). The 
difference between the mean score of STTR in the three corpora will be further 
investigated using statistical significance analysis. 
 
5.2.1.2. Mean Sentence Length 
 As explained in the methodology chapter, mean sentence length analysis 
calculates the average number of words in a sentence. A sentence is defined as “the 
full-stop, question-mark or exclamation-mark (.?!) and immediately followed by one 
or more word separators and then a number or a currency symbol, or a letter in the 
current language which isn't lower-case” (Scott 317). Table 10 below shows the mean 
sentence length in each short story in the three corpora along with the overall mean 
sentence length in each corpus:

 As displayed in the above table, the mean sentence length in the first 
translational corpus, translation before creative writing (TBCRW) ranges from 37.53 
to 12.23, while the range in the creative writing corpus (CRW) starts from a lower 
score, 23.25 to 14.51 words. The overall mean score of sentence length in two 
corpora is not very distant. The score of the sentence length mean in the second 
translational corpus, translation after creative writing (TACRW) ranges from 42.58 to 
12.17. It can be noted that the overall mean sentence length scores in the TBCRW 
and CRW corpora are close to each other compared to the TACRW corpus. However, 
this does not mean that the mean sentence length in TACRW is significantly different 
from the mean sentence length in the other two corpora, Before Creative Writing and 
Creative Writing corpora. The statistical significance of mean sentence length is 
tested in the second section of this chapter.  
 
5.2.2. Punctuation Marks Analysis 
 Several studies in Stylometry consider the use of punctuation markers as a 
	  
	   	   99	  
viable style marker for authorial style analysis. In this regard, Li, Zheng, and Chen 
argue that “incorporating punctuation frequency as a feature can improve the 
performance of authorship identification” (80). As mentioned in the methodology 
chapter this study provides analysis of three punctuation marks including hyphens, 
semicolons and commas. This analysis relies on frequency scores of punctuation. 
However, since the text size could affect this kind of analysis and given the fact that 
the size of the three corpora in this study is not equal, the frequency of each 
punctuation mark should be calculated per 1000 words. Therefore, texts size as a 
variable will not have any effect on the punctuation marks analysis. 
 
5.2.2.1. Standardized hyphen Analysis 
 
 Several studies rely on hyphens as a style-marker to either determine the 
authorship of a particular text or to analyze the authorial style of the text producer. 
For instance, Narayanan et al. and Chaski have used hyphen as a style marker and 
reported that the hyphen, among other punctuation marks, does help identify authors. 
Hyphen analysis was applied on the three corpora. The following table shows hyphen 
frequency ratio per 100030 words in each text in the three corpora (TBCRW, CRW 
and TACRW):

TABLE 11: STANDARDIZED HYPHEN SCORE IN THE THREE CORPORA 
 
 As the above table shows, the mean standardized hyphens score in the first 
translational corpus, translation Before Creative Writing (TBCRW) ranges from 2.6 
to 14.71. It ranges in the Creative Writing corpus (CRW) from 5.27 to 14.54 and from 
0.091 to 8.96 in the translation After Creative Writing (TACRW) corpus. The overall 
mean standardized hyphens score in the first translational corpus (TBCRW) is 5.76, 
which is lower than the average of the total occurrences of hyphens in the creative 
writing corpus (CRW), 9.38. It is also observed that the mean standardized hyphens

5.2.2.2. Standardized Comma Analysis 
 
 Another punctuation mark that is widely used in Stylometry as a style-
marker is the comma (Li, Zheng, and Chen ). The following table shows the mean 
Standardized Comma score in each short story in the three corpora (TBCRW, CRW, 
TACRW) along with the overall standardized comma score for each corpus.

	   	   102	  
 The above table displays the results of standardized comma analysis in the 
three corpora. The mean score of standardized comma in the first translational corpus 
translation Before Creative Writing (TBCRW) is the highest, 51.12, followed by the 
mean score of standardized comma in the second translational corpus, 48.90, 
translation After Creative Writing (TACRW). It is clear that the mean scores of 
standardized comma for the two translational corpora are relatively close to each 
other compared to the mean score of standardized comma in the Creative Writing 
corpus (51.12). 
 
5.2.2.3. Standardized Semicolon Analysis 
 
 The semicolon as a style marker has been used in many studies investigating 
authorial style (Hänlein; Ramyaa, Rasheed, and He). Ramyaa, Rasheed, and He 
pointed out that “semicolons indicate the reluctance of an author to stop a sentence 
where (s)he could”. That being said, semicolon analysis might reveal the 
idiosyncratic style of authors in using this specific punctuation mark. Table 13 below 
provides the standardized semicolon score for each short story along with the overall 
score of each corpus:

Mean±SD 2.46 ±1.55 Mean±SD 2.12±2.0 Mean±SD  1.08±.54 
 
 The above table displays the mean score of standardized semicolon in the 
three corpora. It can be noticed that the mean score of semicolons in the first 
translational corpus, translation Before Creative writing (TBCRW), is the highest 
with a mean score of 2.46. The mean score of standardized semicolon in the Creative 
writing corpus (CRW) is 2.12, which is not very different from that of the first 
transitional corpus. However, the mean of standardized semicolon score in the second 
translational corpus, translation After Creative Writing (TACRW) was 1.08, which is 
lower than that of the other two corpora. 
 
5.2.3. SPSS Statistical Analysis  
 The results of the corpus analysis in the above section was then verified 
using one-way ANOVA test in order to determine if there is a significant difference 
	  
	   	   104	  
between the mean scores of the above discussed style-markers under the three 
conditions (Translation Before Creative Writing, Creative Writing, and Translation 
After Creative Writing). Post hoc groups comparison using the Tukey HSD test was 
run also when there was a significant difference between the mean scores of style 
markers under the three condition in order to determine which groups (translation 
before, creative writing and translation after) are significantly different from each 
other and which groups are not considering the different style markers. This analysis 
would help solidify any conclusion drawn from the possible effects of J-D’s 
translating activity on his creative writing activity and vice versa. The following 
sections report the AVOVA and the Tukey’s HSD test results. 
 
5.2.3.1. Textual Analysis 
5.2.3.1.1. Standardized Type-Token Ratios (STTRs) 
 Mean Standard Type/Token Ratios (STTRs) for the three conditions (Before 
Creative Writing, Creative Writing, and After Creative Writing) of the independent 
variable (Text Production Activity) were submitted to one-way independent samples 
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). There was a significant effect of Text Production 
Activity, F(2,42) = 4.338, p = .019 on the mean STTRs of the three conditions. Thus, 
at least two of the mean STTRs, for Before Creative Writing [M = 49.27, SD = 2.62], 
Creative Writing [M = 51.19, SD =1.48], and After Creative Writing [M = 49.06, SD 
= 2.28], were significantly different.  
	  
	   	   105	  
Post hoc comparisons using the Tukey HSD test indicated a significant 
difference between mean STTR of Creative Writing and mean STTR of After 
Creative Writing (p = .028). The difference between mean STTR of Before Creative 
Writing and mean STTR of Creative Writing approached significance (p = .052). 
However, there was no significant difference between mean STTR of Before Creative 
Writing and mean STTR of After Creative Writing (p = .963). 
 
5.2.3.2. Mean Sentence Length  
 Sentence Length Means for the three conditions (Before Creative Writing, 
Creative Writing, and After Creative Writing) of the independent variable (Text 
Production Activity) were submitted to one-way independent-samples Analysis of 
Variance (ANOVA). There was not a significant effect of Text Production Activity, 
[F (2,42) =0.665, p = .520], on the three conditions (Before Creative Writing, Creative 
Writing, and After Creative Writing). 
 
5.2.3.3. Punctuation Marks analysis 
5.2.3.3.1. Standardized Comma analysis  
Mean standardized comma scores for the three conditions (Before Creative 
Writing, Creative Writing, and After Creative Writing) of the independent variable 
(Text Production Activity) were submitted to a one-way independent-samples 
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). There was a significant effect of Text Production 
Activity, [F (2, 42) = 0.665; p = 0.013] on the standardized comma means in the three 
	  
	   	   106	  
conditions. Thus, at least two of the mean standardized comma score, for Before 
Creative Writing [M= 4.186, SD= .191], Creative Writing [M= 4.29, SD= .072], and 
After Creative Writing [M= 4.186, SD= .191], were significantly different. 
Post hoc comparisons using the Tukey HSD test indicated a significant 
difference between the mean standardized comma score of Creative Writing and the 
mean standardized comma score of Before Creative Writing (p = .013). However, 
there was no significant difference between mean standardized comma score of After 
Creative Writing and mean standardized comma score of Creative Writing (p = .067). 
There was no significant difference between the mean standardized comma score of 
After Creative Writing and the mean standardized comma score of Before Creative (p 
= .136). 
 
5.2.3.3.2. Standardized Hyphen analysis  
 Mean standardized hyphen ratio for the three conditions (Before Creative 
Writing, Creative Writing, and After Creative Writing) of the independent variable 
(Text Production Activity) were submitted to a one-way independent-samples 
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). There was a significant effect of Text Production 
Activity, [F (2, 42) = 11.03; p = 0.00] on the mean standardized hyphen ratio for the 
three conditions. Thus, at least two of the mean standardized hyphen ratios, for 
Before Creative Writing [M= 5.76, SD= 3.44], Creative Writing [M= 9.38, SD= 
2.54], and After Creative Writing [M= 4.74, SD= 2.42], were significantly different.  
	  
	   	   107	  
Post hoc comparisons using the Tukey HSD test indicated a significant 
difference between the mean standardized hyphen score of Creative Writing and the 
mean standardized hyphen score of Before Creative Writing (p = .003). There was a 
significant difference between the mean standardized hyphen score of After Creative 
Writing and the mean standardized hyphen score of Creative Writing (p = .000). 
However, there is no significant difference between mean standardized hyphen score 
of After Creative Writing and the mean standardized hyphen score of Before Creative 
Writing (p = .593). 
 
5.2.3.3.3. Standardized Semicolon analysis  
Mean standardized semicolon scores for the three conditions (Before Creative 
Writing, Creative Writing, and After Creative Writing) of the independent variable 
(Text Production Activity) were submitted to a one-way independent-samples 
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). There was a significant effect of Text Production 
Activity, [F (2, 42) = 3.457; p = .041] on the mean standardized semicolon scores of 
the three conditions. Thus, at least two of the mean standardized semicolon scores, for 
Before Creative Writing [M= 2.46, SD= .40], Creative Writing [M= 2.11, SD= 2.00], 
and After Creative Writing [M= 1.08, SD= .54], were significantly different.  
Post hoc comparisons using the Tukey HSD test indicated a significant 
difference between the mean standardized semicolon score of Before Creative 
Writing and the mean standardized semicolon score of After Creative Writing (p = 
.040). However, there was not a significant difference between the mean standardized 
	  
	   	   108	  
semicolon of Before Creative Writing and the mean standardized comma of Creative 
Writing (p = .802). There was no significant difference between mean standardized 
semicolon ratio of After Creative Writing and mean standardized comma of After 
Creative Writing (p = .153). 
 
5.3. Machine Learning Stylometry 
 Machine learning stylometry is used in this section to determine which of J-
D text production activities (translation Before Creative Writing, Creative Writing 
and translation After Creative Writing) is stylistically closer to the other. The 
stylometric analysis of J-D’s translations and creative writings is based on the 
analysis of three style markers including character n-grams31, Part of Speech (POS) 
n-grams and word n-grams. In the machine learning stylometry experiments reported 
in this chapter, J-D’s translations before creative writing (TBCRW) and after creative 
writing (TACRW) are used as training corpora. The creative writing short stories 
(CRW) are used as query documents in order to reveal the extent to which the 
authorial stylistic profile of J-D in his creative writing is close to his translational 
stylistic profile in the translations produced before and after creative writing. Figure 
13 below shows how machine-learning stylometric analysis is applied in this study: 
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
	  
	  
31	  N-­‐gram	  is	  a	  sequence	  of	  textual	  data	  in	  n	  size.	  For	  example	  word	  3-­‐gram	  is	  a	  cluster	  consisting	  of	  three	  
words.	  	  In	  the	  same	  manner,	  character	  3-­‐gram	  is	  a	  cluster	  of	  three	  characters	  for	  example	  3-­‐grams	  of	  the	  word	  happy	  
would	  be	  “hap”,	  “app”,	  and	  “ppy”.	  	  	  
	  
	   	   109	  
FIGURE 13: MACHINE LEARNING TRANSLATOR STYLE DETECTION (ADOPTED 
FORM EFSTATHIOS STAMATATOS) 
 
 First, the machine is trained on the style of J-D in his translations before the 
production of creative writing (TBCRW) and the translation after creative writing 
(TACRW) based on a predefined set of style-marker such as character n-gram or 
word n-gram (steps 1 and 2). The machine, internally, analyzes and recognizes the 
stylistic patterns J-D in (TBCRW), (S32_TB), (step 1). In the same manner, the 
machine takes the texts in the second translational corpus (TACRW) as an input to 
learn the style of J-D in those texts (S_TA), (step 2). After that, the machine is given

J-D’s creative writing short stories. It analyzes his style, using the same methods and 
the same style-markers that were used to analyze the style in the two training corpora, 
and produces J-D’s authorial stylistic profile (S_CRW), (step 3). As a final step, the 
machine compares the three stylistic profiles (S_TA, S_TB and S_CRW) (Step 4) and 
determines the most relevant translational stylistic profile (S_TA or S_TB) to the 
authorial stylistic profile (S_CRW), (step 5).  
 
5.3.1. JGAAP Tool 
 As pointed out in the methodology chapter, the stylometric analysis in this 
chapter makes use of the Java Graphical Authorship Attribution Program (JGAAP), a 
free machine-learning stylometry tool. JGAAP is a Java-based program for 
stylometric analysis developed by the Evaluating Variation in Language Laboratory 
(EVL Lab) at Duquesne University, Pennsylvania. Figure 14 below shows a 
screenshot of the JGAAP tool interface:  
	  
	   	   111	  
FIGURE 14: JGAAP TOOL INTERFACE 
 
 The above screenshot displays the interface of the JGAAP tool and shows 
that J-D’s creative writing short stories are used to process the stylometric queries, 
which will reveal which translational stylistic profile (translation before or after 
creative writing) is closer to the authorial stylistic profile of J-D in his creative 
writing. The screenshot also shows that the two translational corpora (translation 
before and translation after creative writing) are used as training corpora. It is worth 
mentioning the term stylistic profile refers to the internal pattern resignation that is 
built by the machine based on the style marker analysis applied on the data. This 
machine learning pattern recognition is used by the machine to determine the 
closeness of the other compared patterns in the other sets of data (other stylistic 
profiles). That being said, the user cannot see the stylistic profile (the recognized 
patterns) of the authors during the processing stage of the analysis. 
	  
	   	   112	  
5.3.2. Corpus Pre-processing  
 The JGAAP tool provides the users with the ability to conduct automatic 
corpus pre-processing based on the user’s input. Before conducting the stylometric 
analysis, the three corpora in this study, (TBCRW, CRW and TACRW), were pre-
processed using two canonicalization methods. Canonicalization is a normalization 
process that converts the data that has two different representations into one standard 
representation. An example of canonicalization is converting all capital letters in a 
corpus to small letters. The first canonicalization method applied on the three corpora 
in this study is normalizing white space. It is a process that converts all whitespace 
characters such as newline, space and tab to a single space. This will ensure that any 
space produced by the text conversion processes is normalized across texts. The 
second method is normalizing the textual data based on The American Standard Code 
for Information Interchange (ASCII)33. This process guarantees that the texts analyzed 
do not contain any non-printing characters. It will also removes any characters that 
are not included in the ASCII table, which include printable characters, a-z, A-Z, 
digits 0-9, punctuation marks, and some different symbols.

5.3.3. JGAAP Analysis Method 
 The JGAAP provides different methods of analysis/ analysis algorithms. 
The analysis methods that were used in the machine learning experiments reported in 
this chapter are Nearest Neighbor Driver with metric Cosine Distance. Nearest 
Neighbor is an algorithm that presents the similarity/distance between document 
vectors in a dimensional space. Cosine Distance is another algorithm that calculates 
the cosine distance between vectors to determine the similarity between documents 
based on the distance of their vectors from each other. Figure 15 below exemplifies 
this process: 
 
FIGURE 15: VECTORS OF MADE UP DOCUMENTS 
 
 In the above dimensional space Dim1, Doc 1 and Doc 2 represent two 
vectors of two different documents. Q Doc represents another vector that represents a 
query document. If the purpose is to determine which Doc (1 or 2) is similar to the 
	  
	   	   114	  
query document Q Doc using Cosine Distance approach we can say that Doc1 is more 
like Q Doc by noting the angles between the vectors. The smaller the size of the 
angle, the closer the vectors and the more similar the documents are. 
 
5.3.4. Style Markers Analysis 
5.3.4.1. Character n-gram analysis 
 As pointed out in the methodology chapter, the current study uses character 
n-gram with n=3 in order to allow a deeper stylistic analysis. This would help reveal 
imporatnt stylistic information such as the use of punctuation marks or lexical 
information such as word class. Figure 16 below shows a screenshot of the first two 
results of the character 3-gram analysis. It also shows creative writing short stories 
number one and ten and their most stylistically relevant short stories in the 
translational corpora (translation before or after creative writing) along with the 
canonization and the analysis methods applied. 
FIGURE 16: MACHINE LEARNING CHARACTER 3-GRAM ANALYSIS 
 
	  
	   	   115	  
 The character n-gram analysis with n=3 revealed that J-D’s translational 
stylistic profile34 in the short stories he translated after the production of creative 
writing (TACRW) is closer to his authorial stylistic profile35 in his creative writing 
(CRW). The analysis showed that the authorial stylistic profile of J-D in thirteen short 
stories was closer to his translational stylistic profile in the short stories he translated 
after the production of creative writing (TACRW). The analysis also revealed that J-
D authorial stylistic profile in only two of his creative writing short stories is similar 
to his translational stylistic profile in the short stories he produced before the 
production of creative writing.  
 
5.3.4.2. Part-of-Speech (POS) Analysis 
 POS n-gram analysis reveals syntactic patters related to the text author. In 
this experiment, the goal is to investigate whether or not the syntactic style of J-D in 
the translations produced before creative writing impacted his syntactic style in his 
creative writing. In order to perform this type of analysis, this study uses an automatic 
POS Tagger that is embedded in the JGAAP tool. Using JGAAP, POS n-gram 
analysis is conducted with n= 2, 3, 4. Figure 17 below shows a screenshot of the first 
two results of the POS 3-gram analysis:

	   	   116	  
FIGURE 17: MACHINE LEARNING POS N-GRAM ANALYSIS 
 
 The character POS n-gram analysis with n=3 revealed that J-D’s 
translational stylistic profile36 in the short stories he translated before the production 
of creative writing (TACRW) is closer to his authorial stylistic profile37 in his 
creative writing (CRW). The analysis showed that the authorial stylistic profile of J-D 
in the fifteen short stories was closer to his translational stylistic profile in the short 
stories he translated after the production of creative writing (TACRW). It also 
revealed that none of the creative writing short stories is close to J-D’s translational 
stylistic profile in the short stories he produced after the production of creative 
writing. The same experiment was conducted with different n size (n= 2, 3 and 4) and

writing.	  
	  
	   	   117	  
the results had not changed. The results also showed that none of the creative writing 
short stories’ syntactic style is close to the control corpus syntactic style. This 
confirms that the syntactic style of the creative writing short stories was impacted by 
J-D’s own style in the short stories translated before the production of creative 
writing. That being said, the syntactic style or conventions of the target language did 
not have any impact on J-D’s personal syntactic style in his creative writing. 
 
5.3.4.3. Word n-gram Analysis 
 The last style marker analyzed in this study using machine learning is word 
n-gram. As pointed out in the methodology chapter, word n-gram analysis reveals 
lexical patterns related to the author’s own lexical choice and to the document theme 
or topic. This study sets the size of n= 3 and 4 in the word n-gram analysis. Figure 18 
below shows a screenshot of the first two outputs of the word 3-gram analysis:  
FIGURE 18: MACHINE LEARNING WORD N-GRAM ANALYSIS 
 
	  
	   	   118	  
 The word n-gram analysis with n=3 revealed that J-D’s translational stylistic 
profile38 in the short stories he translated after the production of creative writing 
(TACRW) is closer to his authorial stylistic profile39 in his creative writing. The 
analysis showed that the authorial stylistic profile of J-D in twelve short stories was 
closer to his translational stylistic profile in the short stories he translated after the 
production of creative writing (TACRW). The analysis also revealed that J-D 
authorial stylistic profile in only three of his creative writing is similar to his 
translational stylistic profile in the short stories he produced before the production of 
creative writing. The same experiment was run with a different n size, n=4. The result 
of a bigger n size showed an increase in the number of the creative writing short 
stories in which the authorial stylistic profile of J-D is more like his translational 
stylistic profile in the short stories he translated after the production if his short 
stories. The number of short stories with n=3 was 12 while with n=4 it increased to 
13. 
 
5.3.5. Conclusion 
The first part of this chapter presented the corpus quantitative analysis of three 
style-markers (STTR, mean sentence length and punctuation marks, commas,

hyphens and semicolons) in the three corpora in this study: the corpus of short stories 
translated before the production of creative writing (TACRW), Creative Writing short 
stories (CRW) and short stories translated after the production of creative writing 
(TACRW_raw). This chapter also reported the results of the one-way (ANOVA) with 
post hoc comparisons using the Tukey HSD test that was applied on the quantitative 
data derived from the corpus analysis. The statistical significance analysis revealed 
that there was a significant difference between STTR of Creative Writing and STTR 
of the translated short stories produced After Creative Writing. It also shown that 
there was a difference between STTR of short stories translated before Creative 
Writing and STTR of the Creative Writing short stories. The data analysis also 
revealed that there was no significant difference between STTR of the short stories 
translated before the production of Creative Writing and STTR of short stories 
translated After Creative Writing. As for the second style marker, mean sentence 
length, it was shown that there was no significance difference in the mean sentence 
length in the three corpora (TBCRW, TACRW and CRW), which means that the 
sentences in the three corpora are, to a great extent, of a similar length.  
The punctuation marks analysis, which included three punctuation marks 
(commas, semicolon and hyphen), revealed that there was no significant difference 
between J-D’s use of comma and semicolons in his creative writing and in the short 
stories he translated after the production of his creative writing. It was also noticed 
that there was no significant difference between J-D’s use of comma in the short 
stories J-D translated before or after the production of his creative writing. However, 
	  
	   	   120	  
J-D’s use of commas and in his creative writing was significantly different from his 
use of the same punctuation mark in the short stories translated before the production 
of creative writing. The semicolon analysis also revealed that J-D’s use of semicolon 
in the short stories translated before the creative writing was not different from his 
use of the same punctuation mark in the creative writing short stories. However, the 
analysis showed that there was a significant difference between J-D’s use of 
semicolon in the short stories translated before and after the production of his creative 
writing. As for the third punctuation mark, the hyphen, the analysis revealed that J-
D’s use of hyphens in his creative writing is different from his use of the same 
punctuation mark in his translation after and before the production of the creative 
writing. 
The second section of this chapter applied a machine-learning approach to 
style analysis in which three style markers were analyzed in the three corpora in this 
study The analysis of the first style marker, character n-gram with n=3, revealed that 
the authorial stylistic profile of J-D in his creative writing is more like his 
translational stylistic profile in the short stories he produced after the production of 
creative writing. However, the analysis of POS n-grams with n=3 has revealed that 
the authorial stylistic profile of J-D in his creative writing is more like his 
translational stylistic profile in the short stories he produced before the production of 
creative writing. The analysis of the last style marker, word n-gram with n=3, has 
shown that the authorial stylistic profile of J-D in his creative writing is more like his 
translational stylistic profile in the short stories he produced after the production of 
	  
	   	   121	  
creative writing. The findings of this chapter will be further discussed in the 
Discussion Chapter in the light of translation theories and the main arguments on the 
relation between translation and creative writing.

CHAPTER 6: DISCUSSION  
 
6.1. Introduction  
The present chapter discusses the findings reported in the results chapters in an 
attempt to interpret the impact of J-D’s translating activity before the production of 
creative writing on the creative writing activity. This chapter also attempts to interpret 
the interaction between and the impact of J-D’s creative writing activity on the 
translations produced after creative writing. It will discuss the study’s findings in the 
light of present research hypotheses: 
1- The short stories J-D translated before the production of creative writing are 
close in theme to his creative writing short stories. 
2- The short stories J-D translated after the production of creative writing are 
close in theme to his creative writing short stories. 
3- The short stories J-D translated before the production of creative writing will 
display some stylistic markers that are also found in his creative writing 
4- J-D’s creative writing short stories will display some stylistic markers that are 
also found in the short stories he translated after the production of creative 
writing  
The findings of this study suggest that the first hypothesis, i.e., that the short stories J-
D translated before the production of creative writing are close in theme to his 
creative writing short stories, was refuted. However, the second hypothesis, which 
claims that the themes in J-D’s short stories are close in theme to the short stories 
translated after the production of the creative writing, was confirmed. The findings 
	  
	   	   123	  
also confirmed the third hypothesis, which claims that the short stories J-D translated 
before the production of creative writing display some stylistic markers that are also 
found in his creative writing, was confirmed. Last, the fourth hypothesis, which 
claims that J-D’s creative writing short stories would display some stylistic markers 
that are also found in the short stories he translated after the production of creative 
writing, was also confirmed. The last section in this chapter proposes a framework for 
translator style analysis. The framework also lays down best practices and 
recommendations for compiling and controlling a corpus and conducting a 
computational analysis of translator style 
 
6.2. Zooming into the Results 
The following sections discuss the study’s findings in the light of the 
“translation universals” (Baker “Corpus Linguistics”) and the main arguments on the 
relation between creative writing and translation. Before commencing the discussion, 
it might be beneficial to provide a general overview of the main arguments and 
studies regarding the notion of translation universals and the relation between 
translation and creative writing. 
 Translation universals are broadly defined as textual and stylistic features 
found in translated texts rather than non-translated texts. Shoshana Blum-Kulka was 
one of the first translation scholars to propose what is called “translation universals”. 
She indicated that translated text tends to be more explicit and language seems to be 
more redundant than non-translated language; this is called “explicitation 
	  
	   	   124	  
hypothesis”. Until recently, research on translation universals was based on manual 
analysis of textual features of translations and their original texts or on the 
comparison between translated and non-translated texts. In the 1990’s translation 
scholars started investigating the relation between translated and non-translated texts 
using the resources of corpus analysis. Baker initiated this kind of research and 
proposed “translational universals” which she defines as “features which typically 
occur in translated text rather than original utterances and which are not the result of 
interference from specific linguistic systems” (Baker, “Corpus Linguistics” 243). 
According to Baker the language in translated text is different from the language in 
non-translated texts. This difference is manifested in some tendencies that appear to 
be patterns common in translated texts. Those patterns constitute what Baker calls 
“universal features of translation” including: explicitation (translators tend to 
explicate the message of the target text rather than make it implicate), simplification 
(is translators’ tendency to use a simplified language in the target text), and 
normalization (translators tend to conform to the linguistic and stylistic system of the 
target language). Baker argues that “translated texts record genuine communicative 
events and as such are neither inferior nor superior to other communicative events in 
any language. They are however different” (Baker, “Corpus Linguistics” 234). Since 
the present study investigates some textual features in translated and non-translated 
texts, it might be beneficial to discuss the data in the light of the “universal feature of 
translation”. Considering the type of data analysis conducted in this study, only 
simplification as a universal feature of translation will be tested. 
	  
	   	   125	  
The findings of this study will also be discussed by shedding some light on 
some of the major arguments on the relation between creative writing and translation, 
mainly those viewing translation as a means to learn creative writing, translation as an 
inspiration for creative writers and translation as a source for intertextuality in 
creative writing (Bassnett; Bush and Boase-Beier and Holman). Janis Forman 
discusses the relation between creative writing and translation and points out that 
translation was used a means to teach rhetoric in ancient Greek and to train young 
writers on style and invention. She also indicates that, nowadays, translation is used 
by several writers to invent style and theme (676). In other words, translation has 
been used to learn the craft of creative writing and as a source for thematic and 
stylistic inspiration for creative writers. Some translators are also creative writers, 
which is case of J-D. It might be very interesting to link the above theoretical 
discussion to the results of the empirical investigation on the relation and the thematic 
and stylistic impact of J-D’s translating and creative writing activities on each other 
to determine if his translating activity helped him develop his writing skills and his 
own themes and style in his creative writing. 
 
6.3. Thematic analysis 
 The computational thematic analysis using LSA has revealed that the 
themes in the short stories J-D translated before the production of his own creative 
writing were not significantly relevant to those he wrote about in his creative writing. 
This finding was also confirmed by the second method of analysis, word n-gram, 
	  
	   	   126	  
which is also used in topic discovery (Wang, McCallum, and Wei). The word n-gram 
analysis showed that there is no significant thematic similarity between the short 
stories J-D translated before creative writing and his creative writing short stories. 
These findings refute the first hypothesis, which claims that the short stories J-D 
translated before the production of creative writing are close in theme to his creative 
writing short stories. However, the second LSA experiment, which investigated the 
thematic similarity between J-D’s creative writing and the short stories he translated 
after the production of creative writing, was confirmed. It was revealed that J-D’s 
creative writing activity has impacted his choice of the short stories he translated after 
the production of his own creative writing. In other words, the themes developed in 
his creative writing short stories are relatively similar to the themes developed in the 
short stories he translated after he started his own work. This finding was also 
confirmed by the word n-gram analysis results, which shows that 87% (13 out of 15 
short stories) of J-D’s creative writing short stories are thematically relevant to the 
short stories he translated after the production of his creative writing. At the thematic 
level, J-D’s creative writing activity is shown to have impacted his choice of the short 
stories he translated after the production of creative writing.
 
6.4. Textual Analysis 
6.4.1. STTR 
 The SPSS analysis of Standardized Type-Token Ratio (STTR) revealed that 
J-D’s creative writing has a different degree of lexical variation compared to his 
	  
	   	   127	  
translation before and after creative writing. J-D’s creative writing short stories have 
a higher STTR score compared to his translations. In other words, J-D’s creative 
writing has a wider range of vocabulary while his translations have less degree of 
vocabulary richness. The STTR analysis also showed the J-D’s translations produced 
before and after the production of his creative writing were not significantly different 
from each other. The fact that the degree of J-D’s vocabulary richness in the short 
stories he translated before and after his creative writing is similar indicate that, at the 
lexical level, his style as a translator is less complex than when he writes. Including 
translations of shorts stories written by different Arab writers, who logically have 
different lexical complexity levels, would confirm that the STTR results in the 
translated works are more related to J-D’s own degree of vocabulary richness or 
lexical complexity in the translated texts. These findings support the simplification 
hypothesis proposed by Baker, which argues that the translator’s intentional tendency 
to use a simple language by using less lexical variation.  
 
6.4.2. Mean Sentence length 
 The SPSS analysis of the mean sentence length of the three short stories 
corpora revealed that the sentence length mean score in J-D’s creative writing and the 
mean score of sentence length in the short stories J-D translated before and after the 
production of creative writing were not significantly different. This means that the 
sentences in the short stories produced by J-D whether they were translations or non-
translations are relatively of a similar length. That is, J-D has a stylistic thumbprint 
	  
	   	   128	  
manifested in sentence length and traceable through different texts produced by him 
whether translated or non-translated. These findings go against the simplification 
hypothesis proposed by Baker where she indicates that sentences tend to be shorter in 
translated text compared to non-translated ones. This finding also contradicts Sara 
Laviosa findings, which imply that sentences in translated texts tend to be longer than 
sentences in non-translated texts. 
 
6.5. Punctuation Marks 
 In chapter five, three punctuation marks (comma, semicolon and hyphen) 
were analyzed throughout J-D’s creative writings and translations. The significance 
analysis using SPSS showed that J-D’s use of commas and semicolons in his creative 
writing and in the short stories he translated after the production of creative writing 
was relatively similar. This indicates that J-D’s use of the punctuation marks in his 
creative writing impacted his use of punctuation marks in the short stories he 
translated after the production of his creative writing. The analysis revealed that J-D’s 
use of commas in the short stories he translated before the production of creative 
writing was different from the use of the same punctuation mark in his creative 
writing. However, J-D’s use of hyphens in both his translation before and after 
creative writing was significantly different. 
It seems that J-D’s use of semicolons in the short stories translated before the 
production of creative writing impacted his use of this punctuation mark in his own 
short stories. However, J-D’s pattern in using commas and hyphens in the short 
	  
	   	   129	  
stories translated before the production of creative writing did not impact his use of 
using those punctuation marks in his own short stories. It can also be noticed that J-
D’s style in using semicolons and commas in his creative writing impacted his style 
in using them in the translation he produced after the production of creative writing. 
J-D’s use of hyphens in his creative writing short story did not impact his use of 
hyphens in the short stories translated after creative writing. The empirical 
investigation of three punctuation marks in the English translations of the Arabic 
short stories that were translated by J-D showed inconsistent stylistic patterns, which 
might be related to the fact that the use of punctuation marks in Arabic is a recent 
phenomenon and is not governed by a set of defined rules40.  
 This argument is based on the fact that the inconsistency of punctuation use 
in J-D’s translations is revealed as a characteristic in a number of translated short 
stories written by different Arab authors. That is, the inconsistency in the use of 
punctuation marks in J-D’s translation is more likely the reason of the inconsistent 
idiosyncratic use of punctuation marks of the ST authors and since English has a 
defined set of punctuation rules, the inconsistency is more likely related to the source 
texts. 
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
	  
	  
40	  Ronak Husni and Daniel Newman point out that “in contemporary Arabic, punctuation is patterned on Western, 
especially English, principles, albeit with some permutations. The most striking observation with regard to punctuation in 
contemporary Standard Arabic is, however, its inconsistency, which at times borders on the chaotic as a result of idiosyncratic 
variations” (Husni and Newman 244). 
	  
	  
	   	   130	  
The analysis has also showed that J-D’s use of punctuation marks in his own 
short stories and in his translations after the production of the creative writing was not 
significantly different. It seems that J-D’s creative writing activity has helped him 
define a way to use punctuation marks, which significantly impacted the way he used 
punctuation marks in the translation produced after creative writing.  
 
6.6. Syntactic Analysis 
 The machine-learning analysis of J-D’s translation and creative writing 
using Part-of-Speech (POS) n-grams revealed that J-D syntactic style in the short 
stories translated before the production of creative writing is close to the his syntactic 
style in 100% of his creative writing short stories. This implies that J-D’s translating 
activity before the production of his creative writing impacted his syntactic style in 
his creative writing. To ensure that the analysis is not impacted by the Target 
Language (TL) syntactic style, a fourth corpus was used as a control containing short 
stories written originally in English during the period 1960—2012. Even with a 
control corpus, the analysis result did not change. In addition, syntactic style is more 
likely related to J-D’s personal style and not to the Source Language (SL) syntactic 
style. If the syntactic style in the translated and the creative writing short stories were 
different, then it may mean that the syntactic style in the translational corpus is a 
reflection of the SL, Arabic, which has a completely different syntactic system from 
English, the language of the creative writing. Thus, the stylistic patterns found in J-
D’s translation and creative writing are more likely his own personal style and are not 
	  
	   	   131	  
impacted either by the SL or the TL.  
 
6.7. Word n-gram Analysis 
 Word n-gram analysis reveals semantic and lexical relation between texts 
relying on comparing clusters of words, either content41 or function words42. Word n-
gram analysis was used in this study to retrieve the thematic similarity between the 
short stories in the three corpora in this study (translation before creative writing, 
creative writing and translation after creative writing). The machine-learning word n-
gram analysis result showed that J-D’s short stories are more relevant to the 
translated short stories after he produced his own short stories than to those he 
translated before he began his creative writing. This finding also confirms the LSA 
experiment findings, which revealed that the short stories that J-D translated after the 
production of his creative writing are more thematically relevant to the creative 
writing short stories compared to those he translated before the production of his 
creative writing. This means that J-D’s creative writing activity impacted J-D’s 
choice of texts to translate after he began to write his own short stories.

6.8. Character n-gram Analysis 
 The machine-learning analysis of the character n-gram in J-D’s short stories 
and the short stories translated before and after and the production of creative writing 
revealed that his lexical items and punctuation preferences in his creative writing is 
reflected in the style found in the short stories he translated after he wrote his own 
short stories. The analysis of character n-grams showed that 87% of the creative 
writing short stories are similar to the ones he translated after the production of 
creative writing. Character n-gram analysis captures stylistic information such as 
punctuation marks. Based on the character n-gram analysis, J-D’s use of punctuation 
marks in the short stories translated after the production of creative writing is 
impacted by his use of punctuation marks in his creative writing. This finding is also 
confirmed by the corpus analysis of two punctuation marks (semicolons and 
commas), which were tested in the creative writing short stories and the short stories 
translated after the production of creative writing and found not to be significantly 
different from each other (p value >.05). The other type of information that can be 
revealed by using character n-gram analysis is lexical information whether related to 
function words or content words. The character n-gram analysis revealed that J-D’s 
use of function words and content words in his creative writing is similar to his use of 
the same type of words in the short stories he translated after the production of his 
creative writing. This indicates that J-D’s post-creative writing translations are 
impacted by his own development as a writer. 
 
	  
	   	   133	  
6.9. On the Translating and Writing Activities of J-D 
 The findings of this study can be interpreted with regards to three notions: 
translation as inspiration, a means to learn creative writing and creative writing as 
intertextuality. Several translation scholars and translators regard translation as an 
inspiration for the translator to write or to write creatively especially when writer’s 
block moments control the translator’s productivity or creativity. Susan Bassnett, a 
well-known translation scholar and a translator, describes her experience as a writer 
who gets inspired by practicing translation. She argues that “translating serves as a 
way of continuing to write and to shape language creatively, it can act as a 
regenerative force” (179). For her, translation is a source of inspiration that helps 
creative writers to continue to write. Bassnett gives a famous example of translation 
serving as an inspiration for creative writers that of Keats’s sonnet, ‘On first looking 
into Chapman’s Homer’. After reading Homer in translation, Keats was inspired by 
Homer’s work to write his own sonnets (Bassnett 174). Forman, a writer and a 
translator, argues that translation practice serves the activity of creative writing as a 
source for thematic and stylistic inspiration (676). By the same token, J-D’s 
translating activity served as an inspiration for him in his own creative writing. This 
argument can be supported in two ways: first, J-D’s translation style in the short 
stories translated before the production of creative writing is also found in his creative 
writing short stories. This is evident and revealed by the POS and sentence length 
analyses. Second, the short stories he translated before the production of creative 
writing which discuss themes related to the Arabic culture, take place in the Arab 
	  
	   	   134	  
world and talk about Arab characters inspired him to use similar themes in his 
creative writing. 
The second notion that could help interpret the results of this study is the idea 
that translation is a means to learn creative writing. The translating activity is a 
writing activity that ends with the production of a (target) text that has never existed 
as a text in the target language. The activity of writing a target text requires cognitive 
processes including choosing the right words to express a specific idea and adhering 
or choosing to depart from to the syntactic and stylistic conventions of the target 
language depending on the source text. Furthermore, the result of the translating 
activity goes through stages that are also the same as those involved in creative 
writing. In this regard, Manuela Perteghella and Eugenia Loftredo argue that:  
the shaping of text, in both creative writing and translation, presumes a 
critical awareness, a critical thinking which pervades this ‘moving 
inside’ a text and this ‘immediate’ involvement with it. This view, of 
course, demystifies the notion of original writing as a purely 
spontaneous activity and translating as willed activity. (Perteghella and 
Loftredo 5) 
Translators can be seen as the writers of the translation and the translated texts can be 
seen as a form of writing. This act of writing, does give translators the chance to 
practice writing in the target language and to develop as writers. Thus, translation can 
serve as a way to develop a style in one’s won creative writing. Bassnett also supports 
this argument and states that “[t]ranslation… can be a means of learning the craft of 
	  
	   	   135	  
writing” (172); she also argues that 
it has often been noted that periods of intense translation activity in a 
culture are followed by a great flowering of local writing talent – this is 
exactly what happened during the English Renaissance of the sixteenth 
century after the vast amount of translation undertaken during the 
difficult years of civil war in the fifteenth. (Bassnett 179) 
This phenomenon of translation activity followed by an intense writing activity can 
also describe the case of J-D. He had started his translating activities of Arabic into 
English in the 1960’s; forty years later he started writing his own short stories. 
Moreover, J-D’s style, as manifested in the syntax and the themes of the translations 
he produced before the production of creative writing is also found in his creative 
writing, which also shows the impact of practicing writing TTs on the writing of his 
own short stories. 
The third notion used to discuss the relation between J-D’s translating and 
writing activities is translation as a source for intertextuality in creative writing. 
Intertextuality, for Boase-Beier and Holman, is “a process of integrating other 
writing, taking particular elements of another work and making explicit or implicit 
references to them, building these references into the context of the new work” 
(Boase-Beier and Holman 4). If we apply the notion of intertextuality on the case of 
J-D, we find that he translated a great number of works from Arabic into English 
discussing specific themes related to the Arabic and Islamic culture and tradition. As 
the manual evaluation of the LSA results has revealed, the settings and the characters 
	  
	   	   136	  
in J-D’s creative writing have an obvious connection to the settings and characters in 
the translations he produced before the production of his creative writing. Both 
groups of short stories discuss themes related to Arab characters, countries and 
culture.  
As for thematic relevance, the LSA as well as the word n-gram analysis 
revealed that J-D’s short stories are thematically more relevant to the works he 
translated after the production of his own creative writing, compared to the pre-
creative writing translations. The reasons why J-D’s creative writing themes have less 
significant relevancy to the themes he translated before the production of his creative 
writing can be explained as follows: J-D did not get the chance to translate short 
stories revolving around themes he liked during the pre-creative writing period. Thus, 
he started writing his own short stories revolving around themes he liked and felt that 
they would find a welcoming reception among English readers. Since the translating 
activity of J-D before his creative writing did not satisfy him as a cultural agent or an 
orientalist, he decided to assume the role of a cultural advocate writing short stories 
about themes related to Arab culture.  
The second LSA experiment showed a significant thematic relevance between 
J-D’s creative writing and the short stories translated after the producing of his 
creative writing. J-D wrote his own short stories about themes he liked which has 
impacted his choices as a translator in selecting the short stories he translated after the 
production of his creative writing. 
J-D’s creative writing can also be seen as a translation of an imaginary source 
	  
	   	   137	  
text. This claim can be supported by two sets of findings. First, J-D’s style as a 
translator is found in his creative writing specifically in relation to the textual features 
such as sentence length and syntax. Moreover, the sentence length analysis revealed 
that there was no significant difference between average sentence length of the 
creative writing short stories (non-translations) and the translated short stories. This 
finding goes against the findings of two major studies on translation universals. The 
first study conducted by Baker reported that sentences in translated texts tend to be 
shorter. The second study, on the other hand, found out that sentences in the 
translated texts tend to be longer (Laviosa). Those findings do not apply to the case of 
J-D and since his translating activity started before the creative writing activity, then 
it can be argued that former activity is more likely to impact the latter activities. For 
this reason J-D’s creative writing can be seen as the translation of an imaginary 
source text. 
Secondly, the findings of the second LSA experiment, which revealed a close 
thematic relation between J-D’s creative writing and the stories he translated after the 
production of creative writing, could also support the argument that J-D’s creative 
writing can be seen the translation of an imaginary source text. J-D’s creative writing 
revolved around some themes that appealed to him as a writer. Then, he translated 
short stories (in the post-creative writing period) involving themes that he liked and 
which were similar to the themes of his creative writing short stories. In this regard, 
Bassnett addresses the phenomenon of authorial and translational connection and 
argues that “frequently writers translate other people’s works because those are the 
	  
	   	   138	  
works they would have written themselves had they not already have been created by 
someone else” (175). Bassnett’s statement could be applied to the case of J-D who 
translated works that were similar to those that he had already discussed in his 
creative writing. In other word, J-D would have written the short stories that he 
translated after creative writing because they revolved around themes he found 
compelling. The clear thematic patterns that characterize the relation between J-D 
creative writing and the short stories he translated after the production of creative 
writing can also be attributed to the fact that J-D consciously chose the topics he 
wrote about and the short stories he translated which discuss his preferred topics. 
The stylistic similarities as well as the thematic relevancy between J-D’s 
creative writing and translations indicate that J-D’s creative writing can be considered 
as more of a translation rather than an independent piece of creative writing. Lastly, 
the findings presented in this section, i.e., the stylistic impact of J-D’s translation 
before creative writing on his creative writing, the intertextuality found in J-D’s 
creative writing, and the thematic relation between his creative writing and translation 
after creative writing, might be interpreted as: J-D’s creative writing was a translation 
of an imaginary Arabic source text into English. 
 
6.10. A Framework for Studying Translator Style 
 In this section, an interdisciplinary framework for conducting translator 
style analysis is proposed. The framework combines methods from three disciplines: 
computer sciences, corpus linguistics and stylometry. It lays down recommendation 
	  
	   	   139	  
for compiling and controlling a corpus and conducting a computational analysis of 
translator style. The following are the main elements in the proposed framework: 
6.10.1. Corpus Compilation and Control  
 The first step in any translator style corpus study involves compiling a 
collection of texts produced by a specific translator and converted to a digital format. 
The corpus should also be controlled for some important factors that could affect the 
stylistic analysis such as: 
•  Theme43: Structuring and collecting text that belong to one theme or revolve 
around similar themes can either be done manually or using some automated 
methods such as Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA). LSA would be an easier 
and faster way to control a huge corpus for theme. However, the lack of user-
friendly applications that provide this kind of analysis may hinder future 
studies.  
• Genre44: When compiling a corpus for translator style analysis, the researcher 
should also consider controlling the corpus for genre. In other words, all 
translated texts in the corpus should belong to one genre. 
• Time: The researcher should also control the corpus under study for the 
production date of the ST. That is, the corpus should include texts produced in 
the same period to make sure that the stylistic patterns that appear in the 
	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  
	  
	  
43	  Example	  of	  themes	  are	  love	  or	  death	  
44	  Examples	  of	  genre	  are	  novels	  and	  short	  stories	  
	  
	   	   140	  
stylistic analysis are not related to stylistic conventions of a specific period. 
For instance, Classical Arabic Literature was oral and relied on repetition. 
Thus, compiling works from Modern Arabic Literature and Classical Arabic 
Literature translated by one translator may not reveal accurate results about 
his/her style. 
• Source Text Language: When compiling a corpus for translator style analysis, 
the researcher should control the corpus for source text language. This insures 
that the stylistic patterns appeared in the analysis are not related to the 
convention of a specific ST language. 
• Source Texts Authors: The researcher should also make sure that his/her 
corpus contains translated works written by different authors to ensure that the 
stylistic patterns appear in the stylistic analysis are not related to one ST 
author. 
 
6.10.2. Digital Corpus Preparation:  
 One of the best practices for preparing digital texts for corpus analysis is 
saving them in a .txt plain text format with Unicode encoding. A plain text is a type of 
texts that contains very little to no formatting. Unicode is a type of encoding that 
handles most of the world’s writing systems. Saving the corpus in Plain text format 
with Unicode encoding insures that texts are not impacted by any formatting and will 
be processed by most corpus tools across different operating systems and platforms. 
 
	  
	   	   141	  
6.10.3. Corpus Preprocessing 
 A very important step in corpus studies is pre-processing the corpus and 
clearing it from any elements that affect style analysis. This could include, but not 
limited to: 
• Page Numbers: Page number adds noise to the corpus analysis specially when 
conducing character n-gram analysis. That is, page numbers should be 
removed from the body of the corpus. 
• Running Heads: Running heads, if not cleaned, affect style marker analysis 
such as word-n-gram, POS and STTR analysis 
• Footnotes: Footnotes will be considered by corpus analysis tools, such as 
WordSmith, as a part of the translated text. This does affect most style-marker 
analysis such as STTR, word n-gram. 
 
6.10.4. Style Markers Selection:  
 Selecting a set of style marks for the corpus analysis is a very important step. The 
selection of style markers depends on the scope of the study and the research 
questions. The following style markers, which were used in this study, were proved to 
be reliable for the analysis of text producers’ style, either translators or creative 
writers: 
• Standardized Type-Token Ratio (STTR): STTR is used to reveal the lexical 
richness for text producer.  
	  
	   	   142	  
• Sentence length: Sentence length measures the length of sentences in words. 
This style marker has been used to reveal the text producer’s preference 
related to sentence length.  
• Word n-gram: word n-gram can reveal lexical patterns related to the text 
producer personal style.  
• Character n-gram: character n-grams reveal lexical, word-class or 
punctuation usage information (Houvardas and Stamatatos 78), those are 
closely related to the style of the text producer. 
• Part-of-Speech (POS) n-gram: POS n-grams reveal patterns related to the 
syntactic style of the text producer. POS n-gram analysis requires tagging the 
corpus manually or using an automatic tagger such as Stanford POS tagger. 
	  
	   	   143	  
 
6.10.5. Corpus Analysis Method 
 This framework proposes two different methods to conduct the stylistic analysis. 
The first method is adopted from corpus stylistics, which relies on qualitative analysis 
of style markers frequencies. The second method applies a machine learning method 
adopted from Stylometry. 
• Corpus Stylistics: corpus stylistics can be a reliable method for style analysis 
when it comes to some style markers that do not require a complex textual 
analysis such as sentence length, STTR. However, corpus stylistics turns to be 
a limited analysis method when analyzing complex style markers such as 
character n-grams. One of the best practices in conducting a corpus analysis 
of style is applying statistical methods to test the significance on corpus 
output. Applying statistical methods would insure that the conclusion reached 
by the study is relevant and accurate. Selecting the appropriate statistical 
method depends on the variables of interest and groups to be compared.  
• Machine Learning: Machine Learning stylometry is a well-developed field of 
study that is concerned with the stylistic analysis of authors and texts. There 
are different analysis methods/ algorithms within machine learning stylometry 
that can be used to do the stylistic analysis. Based on these algorithms, the 
style in corpora is analyzed and results are provided. One of the powerful 
methods that proved its viability, Nearest Neighbor Driver with Cosine 
Distance, is used in this study. 
	  
	   	   144	  
The proposed framework is summarized Figure 19 below:

 Based on the scope of the study or the research questions behind it, 
researchers can decide on the style markers that they want to include in their study. 
Combining the two methods of analysis, machine learning and corpus stylistics, 
remains optional. However, the analysis of some style markers such as, character n-
gram and word n-gram, cannot be accurately conducted by merely tracing 
frequencies of their occurrences in a specific corpus using a corpus stylistics 
approach. Those two style markers require a more sophisticated method of analysis 
that uses the power of the machine fed by complex mathematical algorithms to 
process the stylistic analysis. This is where the significance of this translator style 
analysis framework comes into play. This framework does not only propose machine-
learning stylometric approaches to analyze style in translation studies, but it also calls 
for the triangulation of methods in conducting stylistic analysis by applying two 
different analysis methods on corpus data in order to reach more solid conclusions. 
This would help fill a methodological gap in and enhance the quality of translator 
style research. 
 
6.11. Conclusion 
 This chapter has provided a discussion of the main findings of this study on 
the interaction and the relation between J-D’s creative writing and translating 
activities. The discussion has showed that J-D’s translation served him as a means to 
practice writing in the target language and as a source for intertextuality and 
inspiration for his creative writing. The discussion has also revealed that J-D’s 
	  
	   	   146	  
creative writing impacted his choices of the short stories translated after his creative 
writing. The last section of this chapter has proposed an interdisciplinary framework 
for translator style analysis. The framework outlines some recommendations for 
corpus compilation and control as well as for the computational analysis of translator 
style. This latter relies on two different approaches: corpus stylistics and machine 
learning Stylometry. The framework also suggests a set of style markers that proved 
to be viable for translator style analysis.  
The following chapter provides a summary of the dissertation’s findings, discusses 
the limitations of the present study and proposes directions for future research.

CHAPTER 7: CONCLUSION   
 
7.1. Summary of Results
 The motivations that initiated this study were related firstly, to the lack of a 
well-defined methodological framework to study translators’ style and, secondly, to 
the very limited number of studies that empirically address the relation between 
creative writings and translations written by the same translator. As mentioned earlier 
in the literature review chapter, previous studies investigating translator style showed 
methodological flaws related to corpus compilation, control and analysis. Even major 
studies, (e.g. Baker "Towards a Methodology"), that established this area did not 
apply statistical significance tests on the corpus quantitative analysis results and 
relied on raw statistics related to style marker frequencies, such as Standardized Type 
Token Ratio (STTR), sentence length and punctuation marks.  Another motivation 
behind this study was the lack of empirical studies investigating the relation between 
the creative writing activity and the translating activity of the same person and the 
potential interaction between both activities. Most of the studies dealing with the 
notions of creative writing and translation either have methodological issues (e.g. 
Walder "Investigating Style in Translation and Original Writing") or are not based on 
empirical evidence to support their arguments and conclusions (e.g. Bassnett’s "The 
Writer of Translations"). The present study tried to fill this gap by using analysis 
triangulation as an approach to empirically investigate the impact of creative writing 
on translation and vice versa in the case of Denys Johnson-Davies (J-D). To do this, I 
proposed four hypotheses and conducted empirical investigation of J-D’s style in his 
	  
	   	   148	  
translation and creative writing to support or refute the proposed hypotheses. The 
investigation of J-D’s style in his creative writing and translations relied on analyzing 
style markers through three computational methods, namely: Latent Semantic 
Analysis (LSA), corpus linguistics and machine learning stylometry. 
The first hypothesis, according to which J-D’s translations before creative 
writing have a thematic relevancy to his creative writing short stories, was refuted. As 
discussed in chapter four, the LSA experiment revealed that there was no significant 
thematic relevancy between the short stories J-D translated before the production of 
his creative writing and his own creative writing short stories. However, the second 
hypothesis, which claims that J-D’s creative writing short stories is thematically 
relevant to the works he translated after the production of his creative writing, was 
confirmed by the second LSA experiment reported in chapter four. The importance of 
the LSA analysis in this study is twofold. First, it revealed the thematic relation 
between J-D’s creative writing and translations. Second, it allowed for the creation of 
two translational sub-corpora controlled for theme, which was important to make sure 
that theme does not have any impact on style.  
Triangulating the thematic analysis of the three corpora using word n-gram 
has also revealed a thematic relevance between J-D’s creative writing and the short 
stories translated after the production of his short stories. The thematic analysis 
findings showed that J-D’s creative writing activity impacted his choice of the short 
stories he translated after the production of his creative writing. The manual 
evaluation of the LSA results showed that he wrote his short stories on themes related 
	  
	   	   149	  
to Arabic culture and traditions and discussing the life of Arab characters. Those 
elements were also the main elements that built the story line of the short stories that 
J-D translated before the production of his creative writing. That is, this study argues 
that J-D’s translating activity served as a source of inspiration and intertextuality for 
his creative writing short stories at the thematic level. 
The thematic analysis of J-D’s translations and creative writings was followed 
by analyses of style markers including STTR, mean sentence length and punctuation 
marks in order to test the third and the fourth research hypotheses, which were 
confirmed. As it was reported in chapter five, the STTR analysis revealed a significant 
difference between J-D’s creative writing short stories and the stories he translated 
after and before creative writing. However, the sentence length analysis has shown 
that there was no significant difference between the average sentence length in J-D’s 
creative writing short stories and his translation before and after the production of 
creative writing. The analysis of the three punctuation marks (comma, semicolon and 
hyphen) revealed inconstancy.  
The analysis of commas and semicolons showed that J-D’s use of those two 
punctuation marks in his creative writing was not impacted by his style the 
translations he produced before the production of creative writing. However, his 
idiosyncratic use of commas and semicolons in his creative writing was found in the 
translations he produced after the production of his creative writing. The analysis of 
the third punctuation mark, the hyphen, showed that J-D’s use of hyphens in three 
corpora differed from each other.  
	  
	   	   150	  
Chapter five applied one-way independent samples Analysis of Variance 
(ANOVA) with Post hoc comparisons using the Tukey HSD on the quantitative output 
of the corpus analysis of the style markers. Applying significance analysis in this 
chapter revealed the importance of this kind of tests for corpus studies that compare 
statistical information between groups of texts. This chapter also indicated that the 
raw statistical information provided by corpus tools such as WordSmith, might not be 
enough to draw conclusions. This was evident in the analysis of mean sentence length 
in the present study. The corpus analysis showed that the average sentence length in 
J-D’s translations before the production of his creative writing was 21.37 words per 
sentence, the average sentence length in the creative writing sentences stories was 
20.68 while it was lower in the translation J-D produced after the production of his 
creative writing, which scored 18.85 words per sentence. By looking at the score of 
average sentence length in the three corpora, one could say that the average sentence 
length in J-D’s creative writing is close to sentence length in the translations he 
produced before the production of his creative writing while the average sentence 
length in the short stories produced after the production of his creative writing is 
distant from both. However, the statistical significance analysis using ANOVA 
revealed that there was no significant difference between the score of the mean 
sentence length in the three corpora. Most corpus studies tackling the notion of 
translator style looked at the raw statistics of quantitative statistics without applying 
any statistical significance tests on the data. As noticed from the mean sentence 
length example in this study, studying translator style relying on frequencies or scores 
	  
	   	   151	  
of style markers only without testing the significance of those frequencies might point 
out insignificant differences and thus unable to bring us closer to an understanding of 
translator style. 
A further investigation of J-D style in his creative writing and translation was 
conducted by adopting machine learning stylometric methods. The goals of using 
machine-learning stylometry are twofold: 1- it allows for the testing of the research 
hypotheses and 2- triangulating the analysis method. Three style markers were 
analyzed using machine-learning stylometry including Part-of-Speech (POS), word 
and character n-grams. The POS analysis has confirmed the third hypothesis that J-
D’s translating activity has a stylistic impact on his creative writing. Character n-
gram analysis confirmed the second hypothesis that J-D’s creative writing has a 
stylistic impact on his translations after the production of the creative writing. As 
mentioned earlier, character n-grams are able to reveal stylistic information related to 
punctuation marks, which revealed that J-D’s use of punctuation marks in his creative 
writing is closer to his use in the translations produced after the production of creative 
writing compared to the pre-creative writing translations. These findings also support 
the findings of corpus analysis of the three punctuation marks in J-D’s translations 
and creative writings.   
 The findings of this study revealed that there is a close thematic, lexical and 
stylistic connection between J-D’s creative writing and translation. As for the 
thematic connection between J-D’s creative writing and translations, it was 
discovered that his translations before the production of his creative writing has less 
	  
	   	   152	  
thematic connections to his creative writing compared to the translations he produced 
after the production of the creative writing, which showed a significant thematic 
relevancy to his creative writing. This thematic connection relates to the fact that J-D 
was interested in certain themes that he incorporated in his creative writing and then 
chose to translate those same themes in the translations he conducted after his 
creative writing experience. The stylistic analysis revealed that some of J-D’s stylistic 
markers in the translations he produced before the production of his creative writing 
impacted his creative writing, while other style markers in his creative writing 
impacted his translation after the production of his creative writing. In other 
instances, it was noticed that there was no difference between J-D’s translations and 
creative writing when analyzing some other style markers. The interaction between J-
D styles in the translations produced before creative writing and his creative writing 
revealed that J-D’s translating activity served as a source of inspiration and as a 
means to practice creative writing. This interaction between the short story elements, 
such as settings and characters, found in J-D’s creative writing and translation before 
the production of creative writing showed that J-D’s translating activity has also 
served as a source for intertextuality in his creative writing. 
Similarly, the interaction between the stylistic characteristics of J-D’s creative 
writing and his translations before creative writing has indicated that his creative 
writing helped him define and build a style of his own in using punctuation marks 
that are reflected in his translations after creative writing and in his creative writing. 
The thematic connection between J-D’s creative writing activity and the translations 
	  
	   	   153	  
he produced after the production of his creative writing revealed that the creative 
writing activity impacted his choices of the short stories he translated after the 
production of his creative writing, which are found to be revolving around themes he 
discussed in his creative writing. 
Lastly, this study proposed an interdisciplinary framework combining 
methods from corpus stylistics, computer science, stylometry and authorship 
attribution to study style in texts either translated or non-translated. The framework 
also provides best practices for compiling, controlling and analyzing a corpus for 
translator style analysis. It also proposes a set of tested style markers that can be used 
to analyze thematic, syntactic or stylistic features in texts, translations or non-
translations. 
7.2. Limitations of the Study  
One of the limitations of this study is related to its reliance on the quantitative 
analysis of style and on a limited number of stylistic features and that it does not 
include qualitative analysis for J-D’s authorial and translational style. Conducting a 
computational quantitative analysis with a critical qualitative analysis would help 
reach more solid conclusions on the relationship between creative writing and 
translation as two activities carried out by one person. Nevertheless, such a qualitative 
analysis on such a large corpus would have been difficult if not impossible to achieve. 
The present study has also some limitations related to the language pair, text type and 
corpus size. This study was limited to a selection of translated short stories from 
Arabic into English and on English creative writing short stories both produced by J-
	  
	   	   154	  
D. That is, the findings of this study apply to the case of J-D in the short stories he 
translated from Arabic into English and in his creative writing in English. Therefore, 
further investigations of the interaction between creative writing and translation 
produced by other translator-authors are needed. Corpus size is another limitation for 
this study. Due to corpus control purposes, this study only analyzes a limited number 
of short stories written and translation by J-D.  
 
7.3. Implication of LSA method for Translation Studies  
 The use of Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA) in this dissertation can also be 
applied to different areas in translation studies. For instance, some corpus-based 
studies can make use of LSA as an automated method for sampling and controlling 
corpora for theme. This would save the researcher’s time and effort and would reduce 
the researcher’s bias in text selection. LSA can also be used for corpus management 
and compilation. In other words, LSA can be used to automatically structure a huge 
corpus of millions of texts based on theme or topic. LSA allows for the possibility to 
collect and extract texts belonging to one domain and build huge domain specific 
corpora that can be used for several purposes such as teaching specialized language, 
teaching specialized language translation and terminology extraction. It can help 
improve machine translation output as well by compiling a huge corpus of text in a 
specific subject field to be used as training data for machine translation engines.  
 
7.4. Future Directions 
	  
	   	   155	  
 The present study has provided a framework for translator style analysis, 
which needs to be verified and tested with cases of translators working with different 
language pairs. The proposed framework to study translator style can also be applied 
to study translated and non-translated text. That is, it might be used to validate 
previous corpus studies analyzing the notion of translated and non-translated texts 
especially the studies that discussed translation universals. The proposed framework 
would add more value to this kind of studies since it applies statistical significance 
tests on the corpus analysis output. In addition, this study has revealed that there is a 
stylistic influence of translation on creative writings, in the case of J-D. Therefore, 
studying the relation between translated text, non-translated texts written by non-
translators and non-translated texts written by translators may reveal some of the 
stylistic specific features that embedded in the three types of texts. In addition, the 
present study made use of Latent Semantic Analysis as an advanced Information 
Retrieval (IR) method to control the corpora for topic. Another future direction might 
be comparing the performance and the accuracy of LSA versus another IR method 
that does corpus topic/ theme control such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). 
LDA is an advanced natural language processing technique that is used for topic 
modeling. This technique is similar to the LSA method; however LDA uses a 
different algorithm to model the data.
