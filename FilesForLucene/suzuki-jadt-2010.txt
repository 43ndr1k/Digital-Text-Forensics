Abstract
This study is an exploratory analysis of the stylistic characteristics of text submitted to Japanese Q&A communities. 
Along with the development of social media, Q&A communities are attracting much scholarly attention as 
important resources for analyzing online communication. In Q&A communities, people freely submit questions 
and answers; questions are classified into subject categories; and the best answers are selected. In this study, we 
analyze the stylistic characteristics of three types of submission, i.e., questions, best answers, and normal answers, 
in two different subject categories, i.e., ‘personal computers and related devices’ and ‘love and human relations 
advice’. The results show that the textual styles clearly distinguished these six classes of text and clarified their 
respective characteristics. Our findings provide useful knowledge about how people differ in their communication 
styles regarding subject categories and on how people select communication styles. This study will contribute to 
research into discovering current online communication styles.
Keywords: computational stylistics, online communication styles, Japanese Q&A communities
1. Introduction
Through the development of the Web, various new texts media have appeared (Aitchison and 
Lewis, 2003). In particular, text in social media such as Wikis, blogs, and SNS are produced by 
the users themselves, reflect their users’ interests, and reveal new styles of online communication. 
The textual characteristics of such media should be useful for tracking changes in language 
usage and current communication styles on the Web, especially in the context of Japanese.
Among the many social media, Q&A communities where people freely submit questions and answers 
online are attracting much scholarly attention. In Q&A communities, questions are classified 
into subject categories, and the best answers are selected by some criteria 1. Thus, the text submissions
provide us with fruitful examples of how people differ in their communication styles regarding 
subject categories and of how people select communication styles to fit their circumstances.
To analyze the text submissions, we focus on their styles. Style, i.e., textual characteristics 
independent on the content of the text, is ‘how it is mentioned in the text’ (Argamon et al., 
2007), and knowledge of style has various new applications, such as authorship profiling, 
sentiment analysis, and computational sociolinguistics, as well as conventional applications, 
such as authorship attribution and genre discrimination (Argamon et al., 2007; Koppel et al., 
2009; Stamatatos, 2009; Suzuki, 2009). Styles are useful for determining, for example, the

author’s personality, feelings, sentiments; thus, we thought they would be good for analyzing 
communication styles of Q&A communities.
This study constitutes an exploratory analysis of the stylistic characteristics of texts submitted 
to Japanese Q&A communities. We compare two different types of submission, factual 
questions 2 and personal advice questions 3 (Harper et al., 2008; Miura and Kawamura, 2008), 
which are typical, yet completely different types of questions. By analyzing the stylistic 
characteristics of questions, best answers, and normal answers, of these two categories, we 
can see how people vary their communication styles across subject categories and how people 
select communication styles. Note that we conducted only an exploratory analysis, because 
there are few studies focusing on the textual characteristics of Q&A communities, especially 
in Japanese. By analyzing the styles of the submissions, we tried to derive knowledge on how 
people communicate with each other online; such knowledge is becoming more and more 
important since people are spending more time in virtual spaces. Our study also provides 
fundamental knowledge for many IR and NLP tasks, e.g., good answer estimation, automatic 
paraphrasing, and automatic conversation generation.
2. Data
We used Yahoo! Chiebukuro (Japanese version of Yahoo! answers) data provided to National 
Institute of Informatics by Yahoo Japan Corporation. This data includes 3,116,009 questions, 
3.116.008 best answers, 10.361.777 normal answers that were submitted during the period from 
April 2004 to October 2005. All the submissions are classified into subject categories.
We selected two categories for our analyses, ‘personal computers and peripheral devices’ (PC), 
and ‘love and human relationships advice’ (LH). The former category is a typical one that 
includes factual questions, whereas the latter category is a typical one that includes personal 
advice questions. We collected texts of questions (Q), best answers (BA), normal answers (NA), 
per month 4 and applied morphological analysis using MeCab 5, a Japanese morphological 
analysis system. We assigned parts-of-speech tags by using MeCab and calculated the number 
of tokens per submission and frequencies of function words per text.
As features, we used the bag-of-words of the relative frequencies of function words, i.e., 
functional nouns (noun-dependent and noun-pronominal), adnominals, conjunctions, particles 
and auxiliary verbs. As function words independent of the content represent the affect, genre, 
register and personality of the texts (Argamon et al., 2007), and are effective for sociolinguistic 
analysis as well as stylistic text classification (Garcia and Martin, 2007; Grieve, 2007; Suzuki, 
2009), they are appropriate features for our purpose. In Japanese, particles and auxiliary verbs are 
strongly related to the modality of the text (Otsuka et al., 2007) and adnominals, conjunctions, 
and some particles represent the logicality and readability of the text (c.f., Otsuka et al., 2007; 
Tuldava, 1993), while some functional nouns can represent explanation patterns. 
It is better for our purpose to use deeper-order part-of-speech tags of particles 6 and the stemming 
version of auxiliary verbs as they facilitate more meaningful interpretations 7. Tab. 1 lists the

the basic stylistic characteristics of six categories; thus, it is better to use the texts per month.

3. Methods
After we observe the basic characteristics, we make a text-feature matrix, whose rows represent 
the texts per month and columns represent features (relative frequencies of each function word 
to the sum of all the function words). Then we apply principal component analysis and random 
forests.
First, we apply principal component analysis with the covariance matrix of the features. Principal 
component analysis enables us to view as a scatter plot and to clarify the factors classifying the 
texts as the principal component 8.
different forms of an auxiliary verb have the same meaning in Japanese.
 8 There are other methods of exploratory data analyses, e.g., factor analysis, correspondence analysis, or 
multidimensional scaling. Even though there are no special rules for deciding which method is the best for

Next we apply random forests proposed by Breiman (2001). We replicated the original data 
matrix Mi,j 1000 times with replacement, and extracted random subsets of variables from each 
replicated data. We constructed an unpruned decision tree for each sample by using the Gini 
index. We constructed a new classifier by conducting a majority vote of the set of trees. Two-
thirds of the bootstrap samples were used for constructing the model and the other third were 
left for testing the model (out-of-bag test).
We calculated the variable importance using the following formula (Breiman, 2001):
Coob: number of votes cast for the correct class in the out-of-bag data
Cper: number of votes cast for the correct class when m variables are randomly permuted in the 
out-of-bag data
s.e.: standard error.
The mean value of subtractions for all trees formulated above represents the variable importance 
for a permuted variable. It represents the degree to which a class loses its specific character 
when one type of morpheme changes into another type of morpheme. This method calculates 
important variables directly contributing to the classification in the experiment; thus, it suits for 
our purpose best (Suzuki, 2009).
We used the macro average of F1 values for evaluating the results. Random forests uses random 
numbers in the experiments; thus, we performed the experiments 100 times and calculated the 
mean F1 values for these 100 experiments (Jin and Murakami, 2007).
4. Results and discussion
4.1. Basic Observation 
Tab. 1 lists the results of the basic observation, number of submissions, and number of tokens 
for a submission (mean, standard deviations, coefficient of variation), for six categories. The 
results show that on average LH has a larger number of submissions and is longer in length than 
PC; BA is as long as Q; NA is shorter than others, and NA has larger variances than others.
Tab. 2 lists the respective numbers of tokens N and types (V(N)) for each part-of-speech and 
all the function words in six categories. These results show that BA has a larger N than Q in 
terms of conjunctions and particles and a smaller N in functional nouns and auxiliary verbs. The 
tendency of N is different between PC and LH adnominals. NA has larger N and V(N) compared 
with Q and BA. These basic characteristics show the differences between PC/LH and Q/BA/
NA, which we will discuss in Section 4.3 in detail.
4.2. Principal component analysis 
We carried out a principal component analysis using the covariance matrix of the features 9. 
Fig. 1 represents the scatter plot showing the first two principal components 10. The proportion 
respective data, we selected PCA because its results tend to be unambiguous, and thus it should be applied first 
(Jin, 2007).
 9 We also carried out the method using the correlation coefficient matrix, and found no significant differences 
between results.
 10 Texts are indicated by combinations of subject categories (PC/LH) and types (Q/BA/NA).

of variance accounted for by the first principal component was 56.17%, and the cumulative 
proportion of variances accounted for by the first two principal components was 93.37%. The 
first principal component mainly represents the axis of subject categories, because the texts in 
LH fell to the left side of the scatter plot and those in PC to the right side. The second principal 
component mainly represents the axis of questions/answers, because questions fell on the upper 
side, and answers on the lower side. Best answers and normal answers were clearly distinguished 
regarding PC, but not regarding LH. These results show that the difference between questions 
and answers is rather large, and there is still a difference between best and normal answers 
regarding writing styles. Three texts in a rather isolated position in the scatter plot (Q_LH04, 
Q_PC04, B_LH04, N_LH04) were submissions in April 2004, in which the total number of 
tokens (N) and number of submissions were small.
4.3. Feature selection by machine learning
We next carried out six-class classification experiments (Q_LH, Q_PC, B_LH, B_PC, N_LH, 
N_PC) by using random forests using the text-feature matrix of function words. Precision, 
recall rate, and F1 value in the experiment was 97.06, 96.80, and 96.79 respectively.
Tab. 3 show the top 20 variables in the classification experiments using all the function words 
with their parts-of-speech, variable importance (VIacu), and the notation that these variables 
were frequently used (H) or infrequently used (L) in the category in comparison with mean of 
other categories. These variables significantly contributed to the classification, and, thus, they 
represent class-specific function words. We shall discuss the results by conducting qualitative 
analyses. In this way, we will find many interesting issues that should be subjects of further, 
hypothesis-deductive research. 
4.4. Comparison of subject categories regarding questions
Both categories include the particle ‘ka’ as a frequent expression. This is a typical expression 
for making questions and a salient character of the question type. LH includes many pronouns 
like ‘watashi’ (I; rank1), ‘kare’ (he; 2), ‘boku’ (I; 11), and ‘kanojo’ (she; 16), and adnominal 
360 EXPLORATORY ANALYSIS OF STYLISTIC CHARACTERISTICS IN JAPANESE Q&A COMMUNITIES
JADT 2010: 10 th International Conference on Statistical Analysis of Textual Data
‘konna’ (such; 6) and noun-affix ‘mitai’ (like; 5) as frequent expressions; these rarely appeared 
in the PC category. These results represent the characteristic of the LH category wherein people 
tend to ask questions after they explain episode about themselves. The frequent expressions in 
the PC category includes the particle-conjunctive ‘ga’ (-(subjective); 7) and noun-affix ‘no’ 
(of; 4). These results represent the characteristic that people simply ask about people what they 
would like to know.
Table	3:	Top	twenty	variables	with	high	variable	importance	(VIaci	)	for	respective	classes
4.5. Comparison of best and normal answers
Both answers in the LH category include particle-conjunctive ‘tari’ (- (paralel), 6) as a frequent 
expression, while it does not appear in the PC answers. ‘tari’ is a parallellization expression 
used as ‘... sitari, ... sitari’. This result represents the characteristic of the LH category whereby 
people tend to reply with several propositions, instead of the one specific solution, as is usually 
expected in the PC category. BA in the LH category includes ‘anata’ (you; 18) as a frequent 
expression, whereas NA in the LH category includes ‘anta’ (you; 14); the latter is a unpolite 
version of the former in Japanese. This result implies that answers with polite expressions are 
likely to be selected as a best answer. BA in PC includes the particle-adnominalizer ‘no’ (of; 2), 
particle-case ‘wo’ (-(objective), 3), and particle-case ‘ni’ (on; 4) as frequent expressions, while 
NA in PC includes the particle-adverbial ‘ja’ (-(conversational), 3), particle-adverbial ‘nante’ 
(-(conversational), 2), particle-final ‘ne’ (-(conversational), 7) and particle-final ‘yo’ 
(-(conversational), 14). The former results imply that BA in PC is a writing style like that found in 
instructional manuals containing specific explanations with clear and pertinence expressions (‘... wo 
 TAKAFUMI SU�UKI, SHUNTARO KAWAMURA, AKIKO AI�AWA 361
JADT 2010: 10 th International Conference on Statistical Analysis of Textual Data
... ni ...’), while the latter results mean that NA in PC is a conversational style because all of the 
latter expressions are chatty ones. The results show that regarding the PC category, polite and ‘manual- 
like’ submissions are likely to be selected as the best answers than conversational submissions.
5. Conclusion
This study was an exploratory analysis of the stylistic characteristics of text submitted to 
Japanese Q&A communities. After observing the basic characteristics of the submissions, we 
applied principal component analysis and random forests to the text-feature matrix using the 
relative frequencies of function words. The results clearly show the stylistic characteristics 
of questions, best answers, and normal answers regarding the two categories of ‘personal 
computers and peripheral devices’ and ‘love and human relations advice’. This study provided 
basic, but very important findings on how people differ in their communication styles regarding 
subject categories and on how people select communication styles online. 
Our findings will be the foundation of various research. First, we will develop methods to 
distinguish the best answers from normal answers, by extending the findings of this study. 
Second, we will make a predictive transform or automatic paraphrase system focusing on the 
styles that we identified. Third, we will investigate the changing language usage of Japanese by 
comparing texts of the submissions against balanced corpora.
