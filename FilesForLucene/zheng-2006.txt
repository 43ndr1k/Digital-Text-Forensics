Authorship identificatirm can be fornlulated as follows: 
Given a WI of writings of u number nf'authors, assign a new 
piece of writing to one of them, The problenl can be consid- 
ered as n statistical hypothesis tcsl or a classification prob- 
lem. The csscnce of this classification is identifying a cet o f  
featureq that rcmain relatively constant for a large number 
of writings created hy 111e same person. Once a feature set 
has been chosen, a givcn writing can be reprewnted by an 
TE-dimensional vector, where n is the total numhcr of fea- 
tures. Given a L;et of prccaLegorized vectors. wc can apply 
many analytical techniques to dtrertnine thc caleFoV of a 
new vector creiitcd hased on a new piece uf wriling. Hence, 
the features sct and the analytical techniqucs m:ly signifi- 
cantly affecr thc performance of authorship identification. 
The multiple langua~e issue is an irnpostslnr new research 
d i c t i o n  in t h i ~  field. In the fallowing sections, wc review 
the literature from these perspectives. 
In early smdies, researchers ana ly~ed word usage of dif- 
ferent avlhors to identify authors; however, thc efftctiveness 
of this appl-oach i h  limited since word usage is high! y dcpcn- 
dent on the topic of the article. To achieve generic authorship 
identification in various applications, we need "contcnt- 
free" features, I11 early work. reatures such as sentence 
length (Yule, 1938) and vocabwlaq richness (Yule, 1944) 
were proposed, Later. Burrows (1987) developed a set of 
marc Lhnn 50 high-frequency words. which werc tested on 
the Fedel-ulist Papers. Holrnes (1998) analy7 .  the use af 
"shorter" word? (i.c.. two- or ~hree-letter words) and "vowel 
~ o r d s "  he.. words beginning wibh a vowel). Such word- 
based artd character-based features require intensive efforts 
in selecting the most srpprc)priatite sct of w m l s  that best dis- 
~inguish a given wt of authors (Holrnec k Forsyth. 1995), 
and sometimes those features are not re1 iahlc discriminators 
when applied to a wide ratlge of applicritticrns.

thc Federalist Papers. For the first time. thcir analysis dernon- 
strated the dircrimin~~ting capability of function words. 
Subsequently, many rcscrwchers have confirmed the g o d  dis- 
criminating capability of function words (Baayen et al.. 1996: 
Hurmws, 1989: Holmes & Forsyth, 1995; Tweedie & 
Baa yen, 1998). Sincc f~~nctrnn-word usage determines how te

t-esearch. part of specch 0 s )  and punctuation usage are 
othcr impo~ant  syntactic features which have been applied to 
authorship rcscarch. Sramatatos. Fakotakis, and Kokkinakis 
(2001 1 introduced a tully automatic merhod to extract POS 
features. and a better perFormancc was achieved compared to 
prlre Ituical-feature-based approaches. Binonga nnd Smith 
1909) used the frequency 41f occurrcncc of25 prepositions to 
di5rriminare between Oscar Wifde'r plays wd c h b u y s .  
Baa!ea t t  nl. I20U2) concluded that incorporating puncrua- 
tion frequency as a feature can improve the peformanuc or 
aucborship identificd~ion. These studies demonstrated that 
hyntactic features mighl be more reliable in ai~thorship- 
identification problcms than are lexical featurcs. 
As a recently explored feature vpe. ctructural features 
attracted more rrttent ion. Pcopfe have dfferent habits when 
orpani;rin_g an article. 'Fhese habits, such as paragraph length, 
use of indentation, and use of  ~ignafure, can be stron: autho- 
rial evidence th' pcrsonal writing style. This is rnore promi- 
nent En nnlinc documents, which have lcsh content informa- 
tion but more flexible ~tructitrcs or richer stylistic 
information. De Ve1 et al. (2001) plapohed lo use structural 
Iayout traits and ocher features for e-mail au~hor identifica- 
tion and achieved high identitication pcrrormance. 
As dscussed c;trlitr, key-word-based Fwturcs are widely 
accepted to he incffcctive in azlrhor identification in multiple- 
topic curpora. hcnce rhis type of feature hus Ion2 been ignored 
in this field; however, in some circurnstsmces. the proper use 
of such features can improve the performance of authorship 
identificatiun. We refer to such consistently uscd ancl content- 
related words or phrases as content-specific Icaturcs. Usually, 
these features m express personal interest in a specific 
domain. One successful appriuarim ol' content-specific fea- 
tures was conducted by M~uzindale and McKenzie (I9951. 
They correctly attributed 12 dispuled Federalist Papers and 
concl i ~ d d  [hat content features outperformed lcxical features. 
hul not function-word features. In Zhcng et al. (2003), 
approximately 10 content-specific ftxaturch wcrc introd~iced in 
a cybercrime conwxt. and the results showed that they werc 
helpful in improving the author-identification nccuracy. 
Rudman (1998) summarized that almost 1.000 writing

tion?. Thcrc is no agreernerlt on a best set of featurcs Tor a 
widc rungc oi' application domains. It also ix _gcncrally 
accepted Ihal Ihc performance of authorship analysis de- 
pends on the combination of the selected features and ana- 
lytical techniqucs. 
In  early studies. most analytical tools used in authorship 
analysix werc statislical univariale methods. The pioneering 
study by Mendenha11 (1887) was based nn histograms c ~ f  
word-length distribution of various authors. Another populx 
atrribution tool of chxacterizi~~g the sttttionary di\tribution or 
words or lel~ers is a Na'ive Bayes (NB) classifier of Mosteller 
and Widlacc (1964). developed during their long work over 
disputed Federalist Papers. Their systematic work not only 
provided solid evidence to clarify the disputation but atsu 
grounded this field. The CUSUM statistics procedure is an- 
other tool applierl to authorship analysis by Farringdon ( 1  996). 
Thc csscilce of this procedure is to create the cumulative sum 
of rhe deviations; of the mearuwcl variable and plot that in a

these relatively short doclrrnents with appropriate features 
hccon~es a challenge. 
On the other hand, on l i n t  messages also have somc char- 
acteris~ics which may help revcal (he writing style of thc au- 
her. Since Web-based channels such as e-m:iil. newsgrnup, 
and chat roarns are relatively cauaI compared with formal 
publications. authors are more likely lo leave thuir own 
"wsitcpl-ints-" in their articles. For exarnplc, the structure or 
composirion stylc used In ontine messagcs i s  often different 
from normal text dmurnents, possibly because of the diCTer- 
ent purpclscs of these two hnds of writings. Some special 
Ieatures, such as structural layout iraits, unuvual language 
usage. unusual content markers, and suhstylistic features. 
{nay be useful in Sorming a suitable feature collection. 
Another importnlit characteristic c ~ f  online messages is 
the multilingual nature. The Lnternct is a glohal network. 
Cyber users can distributc online messages in my language 
ovcr cyberspucc. For example. most large international 
criminal and terrorist organi~ations, such as Osama bin 
k iden  and A1 Qaeda, arc using the Internet to f m u l a r t  
plans. raise funds, sp red  propapanda, and communicate (see

htrn). Online messages are distr~bated on the Inrcmet across 
multiple countries in a varicty of languages. Thedore. the 
prediction power OF authomhip identification for di Kcrent 
languages is an irnmcdiate conccm. 
Furthcrrnore, the problem wupe and training-set s i ~ c  of 
authorship identification also prexcnt a challenge tbr onIinc 
messages. As mentioned earlier. most prrt ious sttldies, such 
as authorchip identificadon of Shakespeare's wurkc and the 
Federalist Paptrs. dealt with ;I relatively small n u m k r  of 
nurhms. typically no more t h m  10: and thc riverage number 
of nmcssages per author ran& from les6 than 10 to 300. 
Undcr Lhese levels of parameter ~ettingq. satiufacton classifi- 
cation performance could be achieved. But in the context of 
identity tracing on the Intcmet, the number of potential au- 
thors for an online message a ~ u l d  be large. Since qber users 
oficn use different usernamcs on different Web channels, (he 
number of available niessager for each authc~r nnlny be limiicd. 
Therefore, it1 this rcsearch. we arc interested in tsnmining thc 
prediction power rrF the authorship-ideotiticaticln method for

types or fcatures into the fealurc qet: lexical, syntactic, 
contcnt-specific, and stnictural features (see Table 3). 
Lexical features can be further divided into character- 
huced and word-based featurcs. In our research, wc included 
ch:iracter-based lexica1 features wed in de Vel (2000). 
Fors!th and Holrnes (1996). and Ledger and Merriam

S~ntactic fcatures, including fizncziorr words, piinctua- 
tion. and part of speech. can caplurc w au~hor's writing slylc 
at the szntencc Icvel. The discriminaling power of syntactic 
features is derix cd frcm people's differen1 habits of organiz- 
ing sentences. 1% do not use PQS tags as features in this 
study because I'OS tagging is still immature for some Tan- 
gudges such as Chinese. 
One disputed kcue i n  feature selection is how- marly func- 
tion words should be considered. Diffcrent riets of function 
words, ranging from 12 to 122, have been tested in various 
ctudies (Baayen et a].. 1996: Burrows, 1989: de Vel et al.. 
2001 : Holmcs & Forsyth. 1995; Tweedie & Baayen, 1998). 
Thcrc is no generally ucccpted good set ol' I'unctian words 
for 3ulh(lr~hip iclentifi~nlion hecause of the z nrying dircrim- 
marin2 pcnver of function words in d~fferrrlt applications. In 
thi, resrarch. wc ndopred a large set of 150 function worlls, 
which was selected hd~ed on previous research, ah listed in 
Appendix A. 
We also adopted the punctuation features suggested by 
Baayen et al. ( 1996). Cornbing the runctinn words and pimc- 
tuntion features, we considered 158 syntactic features for 
English online messages in our li-anlework. 
In general, structural features represent the way an au- 
thor organizes the layout oCa picce uf writing. De Vel (2000) 
introduced several structural fcatures specifically for ~ - ~ i l .  
Since e-mail contains inany general structural features of 
online messages. we adopted a how features appiicablc for 
online rnessi?_rcs. In addition. we addud features such n+ 
paragraph inden~atir~n and signature-related features. In 
totctl, we adopted 14 s~mctured  features, including 10 fea- 
lures from de Vel (201K)) and four newly proposed features 
(qee Table 3).  
In addition to "content-free" featurcs, con tent-specific 
featurn are iaiporlant diccriminating rcatures for online 
messages. The sclcction of such features is dependent on 
specific application domains. On h e  Wcb, one user may 
often post online rncssages involving a relatively small 
range of topics w h c r w  different users may distribute mes- 
sages on dirrcrent topics. For this reasou, special words or 
charfictcrs closely related to specific topics may provide 
somc clue about the itlentily of the author. For example. a 
criminal selling piratc software may use such words as 
"OW (or best orf'cr), "for sale." and so on; a criminal
