This paper describes, evaluates and compares the use of Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) as
an approach to authorship attribution. Based on this generative probabilistic topic model,
we can model each document as a mixture of topic distributions with each topic specifying
a distribution over words. Based on author profiles (aggregation of all texts written by the
same writer) we suggest computing the distance with a disputed text to determine its pos-
sible writer. This distance is based on the difference between the two topic distributions.
To evaluate different attribution schemes, we carried out an experiment based on 5408
newspaper articles (Glasgow Herald) written by 20 distinct authors. To complement this
experiment, we used 4326 articles extracted from the Italian newspaper La Stampa and
written by 20 journalists. This research demonstrates that the LDA-based classification
scheme tends to outperform the Delta rule, and the v2 distance, two classical approaches
in authorship attribution based on a restricted number of terms. Compared to the Kull-
back–Leibler divergence, the LDA-based scheme can provide better effectiveness when
considering a larger number of terms.

In order to manage the huge amount of freely available textual information, various text categorization tasks have been
proposed. In this study, we address the authorship attribution (AA) problem (Love, 2002; Juola, 2006) whereby the author of
a given text must be determined based on text samples written by known authors. Knowing that the real author is one of the
candidates, this specific challenge is defined as the closed-class authorship attribution problem. In such applications, the query
text might correspond to various items such as a romance, a part of a play, an anonymous letter, a web page, or a sequence of
paragraphs. Other questions are related to such issues as the mining of demographic or psychological information on an
author (profiling) (Argamon et al., 2006) or simply determining whether or not a given author did in fact write a given Inter-
net message (chat, e-mail, Wikipedia article) or document (verification) (Koppel, Schler, & Argamon, 2009).
As with all text categorization problems, the first step is to represent the texts by means of numerical vectors comprising
selected features that help in discriminating among the various authors or categories. In the current context, we must iden-
tify pertinent terms depicting differences between the authors’ writing styles. In the second stage, we weight the chosen fea-
tures according to their discriminative power as well as their importance in the text representation. Finally, through
computing a distance or applying classification rules, the system assigns the most appropriate author to a given input text
(single-label categorization problem).
In the classical authorship attribution studies (Juola, 2006), we usually focus on frequent words or on a small number of
very frequent terms to represent each text item. We then define a distance measure and determine the probable author of
the query text as the one that depicts the smallest distance. As an alternative way, the machine learning paradigm
(Sebastiani, 2002) will focus more of the selection process on identifying the most pertinent features according to their. All rights reserved.

strategies (Witten & Franck, 2005). In this paper we propose following a third way. Using a probabilistic generative approach based
on a probabilistic topic model (Blei, Ng, & Jordan, 2003) we show how we can determine the possible author of a disputed text.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 exposes the state of the art. Section 3 describes the corpora used in
our experiments while Section 4 presents an overview of four authorship attribution models used as baselines. Section 5 pre-
sents the idea of latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and its application as an authorship attribution method. An evaluation of
these classifiers is presented and analyzed in Section 6.
2. Related work
Authorship attribution owns a long-standing history (Mosteller & Wallace, 1964, Juola, 2006, Zheng, Li, Chen, & Huang,
2006, Stamatatos, 2009). As a first solution, past studies have proposed using a unitary invariant measure that must reflect
the style of a given author but should vary from one writer to another. The average word length, mean sentence length, as
well as Yule’s K measure and statistics based on type-token ratios (e.g., Herdan’s C, Guiraud’s R or Honoré’s H) (Baayen, 2008)
have been suggested as well as the proportion of word types occurring once or twice. However, none of these measures has
proved satisfactory (Hoover, 2003).
As a second approach, multivariate analysis (principal component analysis (Craig & Kinney, 2009), cluster analysis, or dis-
criminant analysis (Jockers & Witten, 2010)) has been applied to capture each author’s discriminative stylistic features. In
this case, we represent documents as points within a given lexical space. In order to determine who might be the author
of a new text excerpt we simply search the closest document assuming that the author of this nearest document would prob-
ably be the author of the disputed text.
Following the idea of measuring an intertextual distance, some recent studies suggest using more topic-independent fea-
tures that may reflect an author’s style more closely. In this vein, we can limit text representation to function words (e.g.,
determiners, prepositions, conjunctions, pronouns, and certain auxiliary verbal forms). Since the precise definition of func-
tion words is questionable, a wide variety of lists have been proposed. Burrows (2002), for example, lists the top m most
frequent word types (with m = 40–150), while the list compiled by Zhao and Zobel (2005) contains 363 English words.
Not all studies, however, suggest limiting the possible stylistic features to a reduced set of functional words or very frequent
word types. In their study of the 85 Federalist Papers, for example, Jockers and Witten (2010) derive 2907 words appearing at
least once in texts written by all three possible authors. As another example, Hoover (2007) suggests considering up to the
top 4000 frequently occurring words, including in this case both function and lexical words (nouns, adjectives, verbs, and
adverbs). On the other hand, more sophisticated intertextual distances have been suggested (Labbé, 2007), where the dis-
tance between two documents depends on both their shared vocabulary and occurrence frequencies.
As another source of features, we could take into account part-of-speech (POS) tags by measuring their distribution, fre-
quency and patterns or their various combinations. Finally, some studies, usually related to the web, suggest exploiting
structural and layout features (the number of lines per sentence or per paragraph, paragraph indentation, presence of greet-
ings, etc.). Additional features that could be considered are particular orthographic conventions (e.g., British vs. US spelling)
or the occurrence of certain spelling errors.
As a second main paradigm, we can apply machine learning techniques to determine the probable author of a disputed
text. In this vein, we can see each author as one possible category using the set of previously described features. We then
need to define a classification model that can distinguish among possible authors. Zheng et al. (2006) suggests employing
decision trees, back-propagation neural networks and support vector machines (SVMs). They found that by solely using lex-
ical features, the performance levels obtained are similar to those of POS and lexical feature combinations. This finding is
confirmed by another recent study (Zhao & Zobel, 2007). Zheng et al. (2006) also found that SVM and neural networks tend
to have significantly better performance levels than those achieved by decision trees. Nanavati, Taylor, Aiello, and Warfield
(2011) have obtained good overall performance with a naïve Bayes classifier for deanonymizing referees’ reports extracted
from two scientific conferences. Zhao and Zobel (2005) on the other hand, found that the Nearest Neighbor (NN or k-NN)
approach tends to produce better effectiveness levels than both the naïve Bayes and decision-tree approaches.
Instead of applying a machine learning classification method, Burrows (2002) designed a more specific Delta classifier
based on the differences of standardized word occurrence frequencies. This method assumes that authors’ styles are best
reflected by identifying the use of function words (or very frequent words) rather than relying on a single vocabulary mea-
sure or more topic-oriented terms. Recently, Jockers and Witten (2010) showed that the Delta method could surpass perfor-
mance levels achieved when using the SVM method.
3. Evaluation corpora
The number of publicly available test corpora related to the authorship attribution domain is quite limited. Thus, making
sufficiently precise comparisons between reported performances and general trends regarding the relative merits of various
classification approaches is problematic. The relatively small size of the corpora used is a second concern. In various exper-
iments, the number of disputed texts and possible authors are rather limited (e.g., the Federalist Papers are composed of 85
texts from which 12 are disputed articles mainly written by two possible authors (Mosteller & Wallace, 1964, Jockers &
Witten, 2010)).
J. Savoy / Information Processing and Management 49 (2013) 341–354 343In order to obtain a replicable test-collection containing authors sharing a common culture and having similar language
registers, we selected a subset of the stable and publicly available CLEF 2003 test suite (Peters, Braschler, Gonzalo, & Kluck,
2004). More precisely, we extracted articles in the Glasgow Herald (GH) and published in 1995. To form a suitable test-col-
lection, we then chose 20 authors (see Table 1), either as well-known columnists (names in italics) or having published
numerous papers. This selection process yields a set of 5408 articles.
This corpus covers different subjects with a clear overlap among authors. For example, five authors are listed under the
main descriptor Business, five others are listed under Sports, while only four are listed under Social and three under both the
Politics and Arts & Film headings.
The ‘‘Number’’ column in Table 1 lists the number of articles written by each author, showing a minimum of 30 (John
Fowler), and a maximum of 433 (Andrew Wilson). This distribution is rather skewed, with a group of eight authors having
published more than 350 articles and another group of four journalists writing less than 100 articles (mean: 270, median:
332, standard deviation: 139). An analysis of article length shows that the mean number of word tokens is 725 (minimum:
44, maximum: 4414, median: 668, standard deviation: 393).
As a second evaluation corpus, we selected newspaper articles published in La Stampa during the year 1994. This corpus
written in Italian language is also part of the CLEF 2003 test suite (Peters et al., 2004), which is available publicly through the
ELRA web site. In selecting this corpus, our intention was to verify the quality of the different authorship attribution methods
using a language other than English.Table 1

344 J. Savoy / Information Processing and Management 49 (2013) 341–354From the set of all possible articles (58,051 documents), we must first select papers with a known author (37,682 articles).
From this, we ignore articles written by more than one author, as well as authors contributing to only a few texts. In order to
form a suitable test-collection, we thus chose 20 authors (see Table 2), either as well-known columnists (names in italics) or
as authors having published numerous papers in 1994. This selection process resulted in a set of 4326 articles.
The ‘‘Number’’ column in Table 2 lists the number of articles written by each author, showing a minimum of 52 (Fiama
Nirenstein), and a maximum of 434 (Oreste Del Buono). An analysis of article length shows that the mean number of word
tokens is 777 (minimum: 60; maximum: 2935; median: 721; standard deviation: 333). In the selected newspapers articles,
we automatically removed the author name (full name or first name) as well as some recurrent phrases (e.g., Dal nostro (or
della nostra) corrispondente, nostro servizio, etc.).
The accuracy rate (percentage of correct answers) will be used as an evaluation measure. As an aggregation function, we
consider that all classification decisions share the same importance (micro-average). In authorship attribution domain, this
evaluation measure is the most frequently used. As a second approach, we may use the macro-average accuracy rate. In this
case, we first compute the accuracy rate obtained for each author then average these 20 values. Both effectiveness measures
are strongly correlated and thus we have just reported the micro-average in our experiments.
4. Categorization models
4.1. Preprocessing
Before classifying the newspaper articles according to their possible authors, we first replaced certain punctuation marks
with their corresponding ASCII symbols and removed a few diacritics (e.g., chiché) when appearing in Glasgow Herald articles.
For the English language, the absence of the diacritics is usually not seen as a real spelling error. For the Italian corpus, we
keep the diacritics (e.g., città (city), società (society)) because the words are always written with their corresponding diacrit-
ics. To standardize spelling forms we expanded contracted forms (e.g., don’t into do not) and replaced uppercase letters with
their lowercase equivalents.
After this step, the resulting vocabulary contains 56,447 word types, with 19,221 hapax legomenon (words occurring
once), and 7530 dis legomenon (words occurring exactly twice). Usually the expression word is ambiguous. To be precise,
in the sentence ‘‘the cat sleeps on the table’’ we count six word tokens (or simply tokens) but only five word types (the deter-
miner the appears twice). When considering only those word types having an occurrence frequency of 10 or more, we count
14,890 types, or 9628 types having frequencies equal to or greater than 20. The most frequent token is the (219,632 occur-
rences), followed by the comma (183,338), the full stop (146,590), and ranking fourth is the token to (95,350), followed by of
(92,755), and a (78,867).
From the Italian newspaper La Stampa, we find 102,887 word types, with 41,965 hapax legomenon, and 14,944 dis legom-
enon. In this corpus, we can count 19,580 word types having an occurrence frequency of 10 or more, and 11,410 types having
frequencies equal to or greater than 20. The most frequent token is the comma (212,736 occurrences), followed by the full
stop (126,891), and the word type di (of) (100,433), ranking fourth is the token e (and) (73,818), followed by il (the) (63,931),
and che (that) (59,600).
Finally, to define each author profile, we concatenated all texts written by the same writer. Using this subset, we applied
the feature selection procedure, and represented each author profile or disputed text by a set of weighted features. Through-
out all the experiments, the text whose author we need to determine was never included in the corresponding author profile.
4.2. Delta rule
To determine the most probable author of a disputed text, Burrows (2002) suggests that the most important aspect to
take into account is the frequency of very frequent terms (the top m = 40–150 most frequent word types). In this set of very
frequent word types we can find many function words (e.g., determiners (e.g., the, a), prepositions (in, of), conjunctions (or),
pronouns (we, she), and certain auxiliary verbal forms (has, was, can)). Following Burrows’ specifications, we ignore punctu-
ation marks and numbers. The main underlying idea is to consider only very frequent words used unconsciously by an
author and able to reveal his/her own ‘‘fingerprint’’.
Burrows proposed to not consider directly the absolute frequencies, but rather their standardized scores. This Z score va-
lue is computed for each selected term ti (word type) in a text sample (corpus) by calculating its relative term frequency tfrij
in a particular document Dj, as well as the mean (meani), and standard deviation (sdi) of term ti according to the underlying
corpus as depicted in the following equation.ZscoreðtijÞ ¼
tfrij meani
sdi
ð1ÞOnce these dimensionless quantities are obtained for each selected word, we then can compute the distance to those ob-
tained from author profiles. Given a query text Q, an author profile Aj, and a set of terms ti, for i = 1, 2, . . . ,m, Burrows (2002)
suggests to compute the Delta value (or the distance) by applying the following equation

Xm
i¼1
jZscoreðtiqÞ  ZscoreðtijÞj ð2ÞWhen computing this distance we attribute the same importance to each term ti, regardless of their absolute occurrence
frequencies. Large differences may occur when, for a given term, both Z scores are large and have opposite signs. In such
cases, one author tends to use the underlying term more frequently than the mean while the other employs it very infre-
quently. On the other hand, when the Z scores are very similar for all terms, the distances between the two texts would
be small, indicating that the same author had probably written both texts.
4.3. Chi-square distance
As a second baseline, we selected one of the best text representations found in an empirical study done by Grieve (2007)
which is based on word tokens together with eight punctuation marks (. , : ; - ? (‘). For feature selection, instead of account-
ing for all word types, Grieve (2007) considers words in a k-limit profile, where k indicates that each word type must occur in
at least k articles written by every possible author. For example, when k = 2, the selected terms must appear in at least two
articles written by every journalist. This selection strategy implies the principle that all authors must use terms used to dis-
criminate between them. In this case, we cannot base an attribution decision on word types used by a single author or more
generally a subset of authors. At the limit, when only a single author uses a given term, we can assign this text to this author
as soon as the target term occurs. However, another author may easily play a masquerade by using the same term.
Increasing the value of k will reduce the number of word types to be taken into account while a small value for k implies
that we consider more words. As for the effective values of the parameter k, Grieve (2007) observed that the best perfor-
mance results were achieved when k = 2, k = 5 or k = 10.
To compare a given query text Q with an author profile Aj, Grieve (2007) uses the v2 statistic defined by Eq. (3), in which
fq(ti) represents the relative frequency of the ith feature in the query text Q, faj(ti) the corresponding frequency in the jth
author profile Aj, and m the number of selected terms ti in a k-limit.vðQ ;AjÞ ¼

most probable author.
4.4. Kullback–Leibler divergence (KLD)
Zhao and Zobel (2007) suggest considering a limited number of predefined word types to discriminate between different
possible authors of a disputed text. Their proposed list consists of 363 English terms, mainly function words (e.g., the, in, but,
not, am, of, and can), as well as certain frequently occurring forms (e.g., became, and nothing). Other entries are not very fre-
quent (e.g., howbeit, whereafter, and whereupon), while some reveal the underlying tokenizer’s expected behavior (e.g., doesn,
and weren), or seem to correspond to certain arbitrary decisions (e.g., indicate, missing, specifying, and seemed). Since punc-
tuation symbols and numbers are not present in this list, we will ignore them when evaluating this authorship attribution
scheme.
In our experiments with the Glasgow Herald newspaper, we found 19 words that do not appear. For nine of them, their
absence can be attributed to the fact that during the preprocessing we expanded the contracted forms (e.g., aren, isn, wasn,
and weren), and the other absences are caused by rare forms (e.g., hereupon, inasmuch, and whereafter). Thus our final list will
contain 344 words (363  19).
To obtain a similar list for the La Stampa corpus, we select an Italian stopword list provided by a search system achieving
high retrieval performance in CLEF evaluation campaigns for that language (Savoy, 2001). This Italian list contains 399
words.
After defining the feature set, the probability of occurrence of each item associated with a given author or a disputed text
must be estimated. Based on these estimations, we can measure the degree of disagreement between the two probabilistic
distributions. To do so Zhao and Zobel (2007) suggest using the Kullback–Leibler divergence (KLD) formula, also known as
relative entropy (Manning & Schütze, 2000). The KLD value expressed in Eq. (4) indicates how far the feature distribution de-
rived from the query text Q diverges from the jth author profile distribution Aj.KLDðQ jjAjÞ ¼

ð4Þwhere Probq[ti] and Probj[ti] indicate the occurrence probability of the term ti in the query text Q or in the jth author profile
Aj, respectively. In the underlying computation, we state that 0.log2[0/p] = 0, and p.log2[p/0] =1. With this definition, and
when the two distributions are identical, the resulting value is zero, while in all other cases the returned value is positive.
As a decision rule, we assign the query text to the author whose profile shows the smallest KLD value.
346 J. Savoy / Information Processing and Management 49 (2013) 341–354To estimate the underlying probabilities, we may consider the term occurrence frequency (denoted tfi) and the size of the
corresponding text (n) (e.g., Prob[ti] = tfi/n). This solution tends, however, to overestimate the occurrence probability of terms
appearing in the sample at the expense of the missing terms. To resolve this difficulty, we suggest smoothing the probability
estimates using the Lidstone’s technique (Manning & Schütze, 2000) based on the following estimation: Prob[ti] = (tfi + k) /
(n + k|V|), with |V| indicating the vocabulary size. Based on some experiments, we suggest fixing this k value to 0.01 which
yields a slightly improved performance over other choices.
4.5. Naïve Bayes
With the three previously described authorship attribution methods we follow the classical paradigm. In this case, these
approaches propose a selection procedure focusing on frequent words. Then, based on a distance measure between the query
text and author profiles, they suggest determining the probable author as the one that depicts the smallest distance.
In the machine learning domain, other approaches have been suggested for text categorization (Sebastiani, 2002). Follow-
ing this paradigm, we first need to define a selection criterion to reduce the number of possible features (term space reduc-
tion). This step is useful to decrease the computational cost and to reduce the over-fitting of the learning scheme to the
training data. In a second step, we use the training data to let the classifier learn the characteristics discriminating the most
across the different categories or authors in our context.
As a learning scheme, we selected the naïve Bayes model (Mitchell, 1997) to determine the probable writer between the
set of twenty possible journalists (or hypotheses), denoted by Ai for i = 1, 2, . . . ,r. To define the most probable author of a
query text Q, the naïve Bayes model selects the one maximizing Eq. (5), in which tj represents the jth term included in
the query text Q, and nq indicates the size of the query text.Arg maxAi Prob½AijQ  ¼ Prob½Ai 
Ynq
j¼1
Prob½tjjAi ð5ÞTo estimate the prior probabilities (Prob[Ai]), we simply take into account the proportion of articles written by each
author (see Table 1 for the GH corpus, and Table 2 for La Stampa). To determine the term probabilities Prob[tj | Ai], we regroup
all texts belonging to the same author to define the author profile. For each term tj, we then compute the ratio between its
occurrence frequency in the author profile Ai (tfji) and the size of this sample (ni) as Prob[tj | Ai] = tfij/ni.
As mentioned previously this definition tends to over-estimate the probabilities of terms occurring in the text with re-
spect to terms that still never occur. As with the previous method, we will apply Lidstone’s law through smoothing each esti-
mate as Prob[tj | Ai] =(tfji + k) / (ni + k|V|), with k as a parameter (set to 0.1), and |V| indicating the vocabulary size.
As a selection criterion, various measures have been suggested and evaluated. As a first approach, we have selected the
odds ratio (OR), a selection function found historically effective (Sebastiani, 2002). For each term tj, for j = 1, 2, . . . ,m, and each
author Ai for i = 1, 2, . . . ,r, we can compute the odds ratio defined by Eq. (6). In this formulation, Prob[tj | Ai] indicates the
probability that, for a random document, the term tj appears knowing that this text was written by author Ai. Similarly,
Prob[tj |  Ai] indicates the same probability except that the underlying document was not written by author Ai.ORðtj;AiÞ ¼
Prob½tjjAi  ð1 Prob½tjj  AiÞ
ð1 Prob½tjjAiÞ  Prob½tjj  Ai
ð6ÞWhen a given term tj appears more frequently in the author profile Ai, then it can be used to discriminate the ith author
from the rest. In this case, its probability Prob[tj | Ai] will be relatively high. On the other hand, the probability Prob[tj |  Ai]
will be relatively small because the term tj will occur relatively less often in texts not written by the ith author. As shown in
Eq. (6), this phenomenon will assign a relatively high value for the numerator compared to the denominator. The resulting
OR(tj, Ai) value will be high. The corresponding term tj is then viewed as able to discriminate between the author Ai and the
other possible writers.
Using Eq. (6) we obtain a value for each pair (term, author), and to rank the different terms, we need to define one selec-
tive value per feature reflecting its discriminative capability over all categories (or authors in the current context). To achieve
this, we need to aggregate the r values, one for each author. Sebastiani (2002) indicates that the sum operator (see Eq. (7))
tends to produce the best results with the OR used as term selection function.ORsumðtjÞ ¼
Xr

ORðtj;AiÞ ð7ÞBased on this criterion, we can then select the m most discriminative terms. As an alternative to this selection procedure,
we will also choose terms according to their document frequency (df) values, sorted by decreasing values. In this case, terms
appearing in a larger number of articles will be selected first. This selection criterion owns the advantage of being simple to
implement and has also been proved to be effective in other text categorization problems, as mentioned by Yang and Pedersen
(1997). Finally, in this scheme as well as for the LDA (see next section), we consider as possible terms the following seven
J. Savoy / Information Processing and Management 49 (2013) 341–354 347punctuation symbols {. , ; : ! ? ’}. Such symbols could provide useful information to discriminate between authors. For exam-
ple, if a given author tends to write longer sentences, the number of full stop symbols will be less than for another author
who usually writes shorter sentences (thus producing more full stops).
5. Latent Dirichlet allocation
Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) (Blei, 2011; Blei, 2012; Blei & Lafferty, 2009; Blei et al., 2003) is an extended version of
the probabilistic topic model suggested by Hofmann (1999). In this framework, documents are viewed as composed of a mix-
ture of topics. Of course, a given document may cover only a single topic, but this is more the exception than the norm. For
example, the document D1 may cover intensively Topic 1, present some aspects related to Topic 2, and marginally to Topic 3.
An equal mixture of Topic 1 and 3 may generate the second article D2. Thus each document Dj, for j = 1, . . . ,n, is generated
based on a distribution over the k topics, where k defines the maximum number of topics. This value is fixed and defined
a priori. In the LDA model, each document in the corpus may be generated according to all k topics with different intensities.
Each topic does not correspond to a symbolic subject heading such as ‘‘Politics’’ or ‘‘Sports’’ but it is defined as a specific
word distribution. In this model, the word position in the document or in the sentence is not taken into account (bag-of-
word assumption), as well as the document order in the corpus. When inspecting the vocabulary, we can find a very specific
word strongly related to a single topic that may appear only in a particular distribution. Usually, however, a word tends to
cover different semantic fields such as the word Java (Java as a drink, an island, a programming language, a dance, etc.). In
such cases, the word may appear in different topics to model its polysemy. Finally, when a word is a function word or simply
when it occurs in almost all texts (e.g., the, of, in, was, would, etc.), each topic will include it with usually a different occur-
rence probability.
Some examples can illustrate this view. Based on the Glasgow Herald corpus, some topic examples with their most prob-
able words are given in Table 3 (after removing the 400 most frequent words). In this table we can see that Topic #3 is re-
lated to rugby competitions in Edinburg (Murrayfield stadium) while Topic #4 is related to macro-economic measures in the
US. Topic #9 is about budget reduction(s) under the Chancellor of the Exchequer K. Clarke.
For the newspaper La Stampa, the same information is depicted in Table 4. For the Italian corpus, we can see that soccer is
an important topic appearing in Topic #1 with the Milan AC and its stars (R. Gullit, D. Savicevic, M. Desailly, G. Lentini, F.
Baresi) and its trainer (F. Capello). The national soccer team appears with Topic #12 (Arrigo Sacchi, Roberto Baggio (il Divin
Codino), G. Signori). Politics is present under Topic #2 with the party PDS (Partito Democratico della Sinistra) and its well-
known figures as M. D’Alema, the successor of A. Occhetto, or W. Veltroni. With Topic #6, we see the financial world with
terms such as borsa (stock exchange), lira (lire), dollaro, mercato (market), mercati (markets), tassi (rates) as well as important
figures of this world (e.g., Marco Biagi).
In this generative view and for a given document, we first randomly select a topic according to the topic distribution for
the underlying text. Then we randomly select a word according to the word distribution associated with the selected topic.
Finally we repeat this process for all words in the target document. Denoting by Prob[zi = j] the fact that the distribution of
the jth topic was used to generate the word at the ith position, and by Prob[ti | zi = j] the probability that the term ti occurring
at the ith position was generated according to the distribution of topic j, we can compute the probability of the occurrence of
the term ti in the document as:Prob½ti ¼
Xk
j¼1
Prob½tijzi ¼ j  Prob½zi ¼ j ð8ÞFor a given document containing nd tokens, we can then multiply the Prob[ti], for i = 1, 2, . . . ,nd to define the probability of
observing this document with its corresponding sequence of nd words (assuming the independence assumption between
words, or unigram assumption).
In practice, however, we are usually more interested to solve the dual view (posterior probabilistic inference). Given a
fixed number of k topics and the observed words (with their occurrence frequencies) in a set of n documents, we need to
determine the most likely topic model corresponding to these data. In this formulation, the hidden structure is the topics
and the word distributions. Thus we need to estimate the probability distributions over words associated with each topic
(see examples given in Tables 3 and 4), and the distribution of topics over documents. Of course, we are interested in the
hidden structure that best explains the observed words and documents. Based on the Gibbs sampling procedure, these esti-
mates can be computed under an iterative procedure. As an alternative way to estimate the underlying distribution, some
authors have suggested using variational EM methods (Blei, 2011).
A few implementations are freely available (e.g., we used a C version written by Blei, and other possible packages such as
lda are available with the R system (Crawley, 2007)). In our case, given as input the 20 documents (author profiles) repre-
sented by their term frequencies, the system will return the estimated distribution of words over the topics together with
the distribution of topics over documents. This simple LDA approach was chosen due to its simplicity and because previous
studies have shown that such simple topic models may provide better effectiveness than more complex ones (Carman,
Crestani, Harvey, & Braillie, 2010).
Finally, using these distribution estimates, the system can infer the topic distributions of a new and unseen document
(the disputed text in our case). To define the possible author of this query text, we suggest computing the distance between

suggestion of Steyvers and Griffiths (2007), we propose using the symmetric Kullback–Leibler distance (Abdi, 2007; Lin,
1991) based on two discrete probability distributions.sKLDðQ jjAjÞ ¼ 1=2

ð9Þin which Q indicates the distribution of topics over the query text, Aj the same distribution for the jth author profile, and
pq(si), pj(si) are the probabilities that the texts Q and Aj, respectively, were generated according to the ith topic or subject.
As a decision rule, we define the author of the query text as the author profile showing the smallest sKLD value.
Various applications in different contexts (unsupervised learning) have been suggested, and good overviews are pre-
sented in (Blei et al., 2003, Steyvers & Griffiths, 2007, Blei, 2012) As a first example, we can mention the study done by
Sugimoto, Li, Russell, Finlay, and Ding (2011). In this study, we can see the topics evolution between 1930 and 2009 in doc-
toral dissertations related to library science. Xing and Croft (2006) suggest using the topic modeling techniques as a search
model depicting a reasonable overall performance. Carman et al. (2010) propose using the LDA approach to build personal-
ized search models and evaluate them using query logs and their click-through data. More closely related to our context,
Rosen-Zvi, Griffiths, Steyvers, and Smyth (2004) and Griffiths, Smyth, Rosen-Zvi, and Steyvers (2004) proposed to include
the authors’ information by the mean of a distribution over the topics. Such a view can be useful to see the topic variation
for a given author, or relationship between authors based on shared topics, but the authorship attribution was only men-
tioned as possible future directions.
In a more closely related study, Arun, Saradha, Suresh, Narsimha Murty, and Veni Madhavan (2009) suggest using the LDA
approach to represent documents as a mixture of topics. In a first experiment, these authors used only 555 stopwords while
all available word types (93,980) were employed in a second. The main idea is to reduce the document representation to a
smaller set of topics (from 5 to 50). Such a compact representation is then used in conjunction with a Support Vector
Machine (SVM) classifier (Cristianini & Shawe-Taylor, 2000; Joachims, 2001) to determine the probable author of a literary
works (excerpts of 5000 words). Using only words appearing a stopword list or all possible words, this study shows that we
can achieve similar performance levels.
In a recent study, Seroussi, Zukerman, and Bonhert (2011) suggest also to employ the LDA approach to represent the doc-
ument as a mixture of topics. In order to reduce the number of terms, they have applied different filters (e.g., selecting only
word types having an occurrence frequency larger than a given threshold). They found that using all available terms tends to
produce the highest performance levels. After representing each document as a mixture of topics, they first suggest applying
a SVM classifier (solution denoted LDA + SVM). As a second AA scheme, they propose to compute a distance between a query
text and two possible author profiles using the Hellinger metric. Their experiments demonstrate that LDA + Hellinger tends
to produce significantly better performance (micro-average) than the LDA + SVM classifier. When considering more authors
(from 1000 to 19,320, using a blog collection), the achieved accuracy rate was rather low (between 1% and 14%), too low to be
practically useful.
J. Savoy / Information Processing and Management 49 (2013) 341–354 3496. Evaluation
To evaluate and compare the different authorship attribution methods, we used the 5408 articles of the Glasgow Herald
written by 20 well-known columnists. As a second corpus, we used the Italian newspaper La Stampa (4326 articles written by
20 distinct journalists). As the evaluation measure we will use the accuracy rate based on the assumption that each decision
owns the same importance (micro-average). As a second possible performance measurement, we can use the macro-average
principle. In this case, the mean performance obtained for each author corresponds to one vote and the overall accuracy rate
is the mean over all authors. We have decided to limit the performance measure to the micro-average because this measure
is commonly used in authorship attribution studies on the one hand, and, on the other, both measures are strongly correlated
in our context.
To statistically determine whether or not one strategy is better than another, we applied the sign test (Conover, 1980),
(Yang & Liu, 1999). In this test, the null hypothesis H0 states that both categorization schemes produce similar performance
levels. Such a null hypothesis would be accepted if two authorship attribution schemes returned statistically similar accu-
racy rates, otherwise, it would be rejected (two-tailed test, significance level a = 1%). Statistically significant performance dif-
ferences will be indicated by a double cross () in the following tables.
7. Classical authorship attribution
Using the Delta method (Burrows, 2002), we first need to select the top m most frequent word types. Based on previous
experiments, the highest accuracy rate was achieved with the top 400 most frequent types (with small differences as more
or less terms are taken into account, e.g., 200 or 600). As a second authorship attribution method, we also evaluated the v2
measure (Grieve, 2007), based on word types and punctuation symbols respecting a minimal document frequency on a per-
author basis. In this case, the best performance was achieved when considering all words and punctuation symbols appear-
ing in at least two texts for each author (2-limit). As a third baseline, we used the KLD scheme proposed by Zhao and Zobel
(2007) based on a predefined set of 363 English words. For the La Stampa corpus, we have selected an Italian stopword list
containing 399 terms.
In order to compare the proposed LDA-based scheme with the other three classical approaches, we will use the same set
of terms. In Table 5, we have reported the accuracy rate of the Delta method, v2 approach, and KLD method using both the
Glasgow Herald (GH) and La Stampa (IT) corpora. Using the same terms, we have also reported the accuracy rate achieved by
the LDA-based approach, fixing the number of possible topics k between 20 and 80. In the current context, we may assume
that each topic corresponds to the style of a given author and thus fixing k = 20 represents a reasonable choice. Of course,
having a value for k smaller than 20 does not really make sense. The value for k could however be larger than 20 reflecting
the fact that two or more distributions of words (topics) are needed to well describe the various styles of a given columnist.
In Table 5 we have reported the performances obtained using the three classical authorship approaches together with the
LDA model. As statistical testing, we used the sign test (significance level a = 1%, two-sided), using the performance achieved
by the best performance (depicted in bold) as a baseline. After the accuracy rate value, we added a double cross () to denote
a statistically significant performance difference.
When applying the Delta rule with the 400 most frequent terms, the accuracy rate (micro-average) is 63.7% with the Eng-
lish corpus, and 76.07% with the Italian collection. When computing this performance using the macro-average principle
(mean over all author performances), we obtain an accuracy rate of 66.14% with the Glasgow Herald, and 75.08% with La
Stampa. The two performance measurements are clearly correlated. Thus we will limit our analysis to the micro-average
principle.Table 5

350 J. Savoy / Information Processing and Management 49 (2013) 341–354The evaluations reported in this table indicate that the LDA-based authorship attribution method performs significantly
better than the Delta model or the v2 measure for the English corpora. With the La Stampa newspaper, the LDA scheme per-
forms better than the v2 metric but at a lower performance level than the Delta model. In this latter case, the performance
differences between the two schemes are not always statistically significant.
The KLD method tends, however, to display a better effectiveness than the corresponding LDA-based scheme. This feature
set defined a priori seems to be not well adapted for the LDA approach. For the Italian corpus for example, this term set con-
taining 399 entries is able to produce an accuracy of 55.88% (k = 20). Using a similar amount of terms (400 most frequent
terms) as proposed by the Delta method, we obtain a higher effectiveness of 72.83% (k = 20). When more terms are selected
(as shown in the top and the middle of Table 5), the LDA-based scheme may produce better performance levels than those
achieved with the small set of terms selected under the KLD model.
When considering the possible values of the parameter k (number of topics), we cannot see a clear and precise prescrip-
tion for this parameter. Using the top 400 most frequent terms or terms belonging to a 2-limit, the effectiveness achieved
with k = 40–80 reveals some small performance differences that are however usually statistically significant. With the fea-
ture set defined with the KLD model, the accuracy rate variations are more important between different k values as shown in
the bottom part of Table 5.
7.1. Naïve Bayes
In order to have another point of view, we decided to compare the LDA-based scheme with a machine learning approach.
As a typical text categorization model used in this domain, we have selected the naïve Bayes technique. Unlike the three
classical attribution schemes described previously, the selection of the feature set is not usually specified within a machine
learning model. Therefore, we have conducted a set of experiments using the odds ratio (OR sum) criterion, and a second set
using the document frequency (df).
As shown in Table 6, we have reported the evaluation of the naïve Bayes model together with the suggested LDA-based
model using either the Glasgow Herald (GH) or La Stampa (IT) newspaper. In these evaluations, we have used the same terms
for both the naïve Bayes and LDA experiments. In a first evaluation, we have considered the naïve Bayes with terms selected
according to the OR sum operator (Column 3 and 4). In a second experiment, we used the document frequency (df) as a selec-
tion function to rank all possible features, from the highest to the lowest (Column 5 and 6). In this case, we favor terms
appearing in many articles over those occurring in a limited number of documents. Such a selection function is simple
and efficient to apply and has been found effective in text classification applications (Yang & Pedersen, 1997). After the accu-
racy rate value, we added a double cross () to denote a statistically significant performance difference (using the sign test
and compared to the best performance depicted in bold).
These evaluations tend to indicate that when using the odd ratio (OR) as the selection function, the achieved performance
levels are lower than those obtained with the document frequency (df) measure using the same number of terms. When the
number of word types is increased, the accuracy rates are improved, but the marginal enhancement tends to decrease. When
analyzing the best number of topics, it is difficult to specify any rule. The optimal value for this parameter depends on the
corpus, the number of terms and the underlying selection function. From data reported in Table 6, we can simply state that
fixing k = 20 is usually not a good solution.Table 6

J. Savoy / Information Processing and Management 49 (2013) 341–354 3517.2. Additional experiments
In a final set of experiments, we want to study the best performance that can be achieved with the LDA-based authorship
attribution model. As a term selection scheme, we first want to ignore words having a small occurrence frequency. Such
words are clearly less important in defining the particular style of a given author. Moreover, they represent a large propor-
tion of the vocabulary due to the Zipfian distribution of word occurrence. For example, with the Glasgow Herald we can find
56,447 distinct word types, with 19,221 hapax legomenon (words occurring once). When considering only those types having
an occurrence frequency of 10 or more, we count only 14,890 types. During the term selection, we also add the constraint
that each selected word appears in at least three distinct articles written by at least two authors. Thus we want to ignore
words appearing only in a few papers or used only by a single author. Taking into account this second constraint, the English
vocabulary is reduced to 2511 word types (or 4.4% of the initial vocabulary size).
From the newspaper La Stampa, we find 102,887 distinct word types, with 41,965 hapax legomenon. In this corpus, we can
count 19,580 word types having an occurrence frequency of 10 or more. Adding the constraint that each word type must
appear in at least three articles written by two distinct journalists, we obtain a vocabulary of 9825 terms corresponding
to 9.5% of the initial size. The accuracy rates achieved using these feature sets are depicted in the top part of Table 7.
As a second feature selection, we have applied a less strict scheme, considering all words occurring in at least three dif-
ferent articles (df P 3). In this case, we reduced the English vocabulary size from 56,447 word types to 26,005 (or 46.1% of
the initial size), but the resulting feature set is clearly larger than the previous one. For the Italian corpus, the vocabulary
decreases from 102,887 word types to 36,928 representing around 35.9% of the initial size.
The evaluations reported in Table 7 complement the performance values shown in Table 6. Using the LDA-based author-
ship attribution method, we can achieve an accuracy rate around 82% with the Glasgow Herald corpus and around 91.5% with
the La Stampa newspaper. For the English corpus, the overall best performance level of 82.84% was obtained when selecting
the top 5000 words according to the df criteria (see Table 6). With the Italian collection, the best performance was obtained
when considering 9825 terms (see Table 7) with an accuracy rate of 91.94%. These values are similar to those achieved by the
naïve Bayes, maybe slightly lower for the Glasgow Herald, and slightly higher when considering the La Stampa corpus.
When considering the number of features selected, having more word types is not always a guarantee to obtain a higher
accuracy rate. In Table 6 with the df selection scheme, the performance level with 2000 or 5000 terms were similar with the
Italian collection. Increasing the number of word types as shown in Table 7 may slightly increase the overall accuracy rate
with the Glasgow Herald corpus. For the La Stampa however, the increase from 9825 to 36,928 terms tends to hurt the overall
quality of the assignment.
The computational cost is however not the same when faced with a larger number of terms. In our experiments using a C
version of the LDA, we need around 1 min and 30 s to build the author profiles for the smallest feature sets (e.g., those pre-
sented in Table 5) and with k = 20 (English corpus). Based on our implementation of the Delta rule, v2 distance or KLD ap-
proach using the interpreter language Perl, the computational time needed to build the underlying data structures was
around one minute. Using the larger set of 26,005 terms (see Table 7), this task requires an average of 21 min and 54 s
for the LDA model (k = 20).
7.3. Further analysis of LDA results
Until now we have focused our evaluation on the accuracy rate and compared it to other possible authorship attribution
schemes. In addition to this assignment evaluation, the LDA-based model allows us to analyze the relationships between the
different topics (or word distributions) and the authors. To achieve this, the LDA scheme returns k topic distributions show-
ing the occurrence probability of each word. Each topic may cover one or more subjects and two topics may reflect a similar
domain but using different word frequencies. Some topic examples are given in Table 3 (Glasgow Herald) and in Table 4 (La
Stampa). However, these examples were obtained after removing very frequent word types. As another example, we can
fetch some topics (or word distributions) obtained with the Glasgow Herald newspaper based on 2511 words and with
the k = 20 topics (accuracy rate depicted in Table 7). Table 8 depicts a subset of six of these 20 topics.Table 7

352 J. Savoy / Information Processing and Management 49 (2013) 341–354In this table, we clearly see that the function words dominate the top part of these distributions. We can see mainly deter-
miners (the, a), prepositions (in, of, to, etc.), conjunctions (and, etc.), punctuation symbols, the possessive form (‘s), pronouns
(she, we, etc.), and auxiliary verb forms (is, are, has, etc.). In Topic #20 we can see the content words Scotland and rugby while
under Topic #3 we can find the word film.
These topics reflect the different word distributions used in the documents composing the underlying corpus. We can use
the topic distribution generated for each of the 5408 Glasgow Herald articles to define a topic distribution per author. To
achieve this, we compute an average topic distribution for each journalist based on all articles written by that person.
After doing this computation, we obtain a topic distribution for each author and an example is provided in Table 9. In this
case, we have limited our analysis to the three journalists related to the ‘‘Arts & Film’’ domain (see Table 1). Moreover, we
have ignored all topics representing less than 5% for all three chosen journalists (these 12 remaining percentages are re-
grouped under the label ‘‘Others’’ in Table 9).
As we can see from data depicted in Table 9, Julie Davidson’s profile is mainly related to Topic #17 (34.7%), and Topic #9
(15.7%). With John Fowler, we can see that his articles are mainly related to Topic #17 (39%), and Topic #4 (10.4%) while
William Russell is first related to Topic #17 (21.2%), then to Topic #3 (16.3%) and Topic #10 (10%). Clearly, these journalists
belonging to the ‘‘Arts & Film’’ domain have in common a word usage reflected by Topic #17 for which the corresponding
word distribution is depicted in Table 8. In this distribution, the most probable word type is the determiner the (10.1%) fol-
lowed by the comma (8.8%), and the preposition of (5.5%). In the fifth rank, we can see the conjunction and (3.8%). On the
other hand, the full stop appears only in the fourth rank. These elements seem to indicate that these three authors tend
to write longer sentences than the mean (other topics have the full stop closer to the top).
Topic #17 represents the common vocabulary they share. But Topic #3 and #10 are useful to discriminate Russell from
the others, while Topic #4 does the same with Fowler. Referring to word frequencies shown in Table 8, we can see that Rus-
sell’s style can be characterized by the frequent use of pronouns (she, her, his) or by the content word film. According to word
distribution of Topic #4 (see Table 8), Fowler uses the verb forms was, were, or had more frequently, showing maybe a pref-
erence for the past tense and/or the passive voice. Finally, the word usage reflecting Julie Davidson’s style is also related to
Topic #9.
Even if for the ‘‘Arts & Film’’ subject we have found a common word distribution between the journalists writing in this
domain, we are not able to find a similar pattern for the five journalists working in the sports columns. Each of them is more
strongly related to a distinct topic, as for example, Derek Douglas who is related mainly to Topic #20 (32.8%), and the second
most important word distribution is Topic #4 (10.4%). Based on word distributions shown in Table 8, we can see that words
related to rugby or Scotland are mainly listed under Topic #20 while the usage of functional words appears under Topic #4, a
word distribution shared with John Fowler.
8. Conclusion
In this paper we described the authorship attribution problem in the context of the closed-class problem in which the
correct author is one of possible known candidates. As an attribution scheme, we have described the Delta rule method
(Burrows, 2002) based on the top m (=400) most frequent word types. As a second authorship attribution method we
J. Savoy / Information Processing and Management 49 (2013) 341–354 353evaluated the v2 measure (Grieve, 2007), based on word types and punctuation symbols having a minimal document fre-
quency of two on a per-author basis (generating 653 terms with the GH corpus or 720 Italian words). As a third baseline,
we used the KLD scheme proposed by Zhao and Zobel (2007) and based on a predefined set of 363 English words. We have
adapted this approach to the Italian language by using a known stopword list (containing 399 terms). These first three solu-
tions represent classical approaches to the authorship attribution problem. As a forth baseline we have used the naïve Bayes
model (Mitchell, 1997), representing a well-known model in the machine learning domain. In this case, we have applied both
the odd ratio (OR) and the document frequency (df) as selection function.
As a new authorship attribution scheme, we suggest considering the LDA (Blei et al., 2003) paradigm that was applied for
different purposes as, for instance, to produce an overview of k topics appearing in a given corpus (as shown in this paper).
We explained how we could adapt this scheme for authorship attribution applications.
To evaluate and compare these different authorship attribution approaches, we have extracted 5408 articles of the Glas-
gow Herald written by 20 well-known columnists. This corpus is stable and freely available (CLEF-2003 test suite). Since
these articles are written during the same short period (year 1995), sharing the same culture, having similar language reg-
isters and targeting the same audience, this corpus presents a pertinent test bed for authorship attribution empirical studies.
As a second test collection, we have extracted 4326 articles from the Italian newspaper La Stampa written by 20 different
journalists. This corpus covers the year 1994 and is also available in the CLEF test suite.
Using the same feature sets, the adapted LDA scheme produces significantly better performance levels than the Delta rule
and the v2-based method. On the other hand, the suggested approach achieves lower performance levels than the KLD mod-
el. Based on more terms, the LDA-based scheme may perform better than the KLD model. Using the same feature sets, and
with an appropriate number of selected terms, the LDA-based scheme may show better performance than the naïve Bayes
model. For other parameter values, the naïve Bayes may demonstrate a better effectiveness. Finally, the underlying compu-
tational cost of the LDA-based model is higher compared to other solutions.References
