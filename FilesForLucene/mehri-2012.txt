a b s t r a c t
Authorship analysis by means of textual features is an important task in linguistic studies.
We employ complex networks theory to tackle this disputed problem. In this work, we
focus on some measurable quantities of word co-occurrence network of each book for
authorship characterization. Based on the network features, attribution probability is
defined for authorship identification. Furthermore, two scaling exponents, q-parameter
and α-exponent, are combined to classify personal writing style with acceptable high
resolution power. The q-parameter, generally known as the nonextensivity measure, is
calculated for degree distribution and theα-exponent comes fromapower law relationship
between number of links and number of nodes in the co-occurrence network constructed
for different books written by each author. The applicability of the presented method is
evaluated in an experiment with thirty six books of five Persian litterateurs. Our results
show high accuracy rate in authorship attribution.

1. Introduction
Recently the complex networks theory appears as a suitable framework for studying social and natural systems [1,2]. In
the language of networks, the system’s entities are regarded as vertices of a graph and the links between vertices represent
their interactions. It is not necessary to know the nature of interactions ormicroscopic details of the entities for construction
of a graph corresponding to the system. Hence the complex networks theory facilitates the study of systems containing
different types of entities with unknown or complicated interaction between them. The human language has the same state
of complexity [3,4].
A great deal of human knowledge has been included in the written part of language, namely texts. There are more than
129,864,880 books in theworld and several tens of billions documents exist on the Internet, hence it is impossible to find the
desired information manually. Nowadays the complex networks theory provides suitable tools for automatic information
retrieval from a particular text or repository of texts. Computing the textual network features or random walks on it helps
us to retrieve much useful information about the text, like the word sense disambiguation, text summarization, keyword
extraction, coreference resolution, question answering, document classification and assessing the quality of texts [5–9].
Some network metrics such as degree distribution, characteristic length and clustering coefficient, are strongly correlated
with coherence, cohesion and adherence of texts which are scored by humans. The statistical mechanical approaches such
as entropic methods are other candidates for information extraction from the texts [10,11].
The authorship analysis, as one of the important goals of text mining, has a long history back to medieval studies.
Mosteller and Wallace’s well-known pioneering work on the disputed Federalist papers by means of the frequency of
function words, paved the way for future investigations in this context [12]. Due to the increasing need for automatic
authorship analysis, many researches have been made on this topic. The various aspects of authorship analysis, authorship
identification, authorship characterization and similarity detection, play a crucial role in forensic analysis, plagiarism

detection, spam filtering, information management and many other linguistic applications [13–16]. So far, many textual
features and various classification techniques are used in this framework. Zipf analysis, entropic metrics and many other
features have been introduced over the years [17–21]. People have classified the textual features into several categories.
In general, these features can be divided into lexical, syntactic, semantic and application-specific categories. The statistical
analysis such as Naïve Bayes, and machine learning methods such as decision trees, neural networks and support vector
machines are the most promising classification techniques, frequently applied in the literature [22–24].
More recently, some network features like the clustering coefficient, degree correlation and average of the out-degree
are applied for authorship characterization [25]. Here, we intend to add some other features to this network feature set
and assign a vector to each author to distinguish him/her from others with a probabilistic method; performing a minimum
preprocessing on the texts. Each author’s vector includes some average value for corresponding network features of his/her
works such asmean degree, characteristic length and q-parameter of the degree distribution. A new scaling behavior will be
introduced for the relation between the number of links and the number of nodes in the co-occurrence network extracted
for every author’s works.
In the next section, we introduce a probabilistic method for authorship attribution based on complex networks theory.
The third section, contains technical details of an experiment with several literary works of five Persian litterateurs for
authorship attribution. We report results of the experiment with some explanations in Section 4. The final section is
devoted to summarization of our work. We also briefly review some structural features of networks and Tsallis statistics
in Appendices A and B, respectively.
2. Authorship attribution by complex networks theory
Natural languages, as complex systems, are neither ordered and predictable—like the configuration of atoms in a crystal
lattice—nor random and chaotic—like the motion of gas molecules; but there is a mixture of these two features in their
behavior. Network (graph) theory provides a powerful tool to study such complex systems. A network includes a collection
ofNn vertices or nodes and a collection ofNl edges or links, used tomodel pairwise relations between the objects of a system.
In the physical context, the number of vertices, Nn, identifies the number of system’s constituents and defines the physical
size of the network. A popular structure for network representation is called the adjacency matrix, A = [aij]Nn×Nn ,
aij =

ωij if i and j are adjacent
0 otherwise
where ωij shows the weight of every link, associated with the strength of interaction between vertices i and j. In this study,
we will construct undirected (ωij = ωji), unweighted (ωij = 1) networks for texts.
2.1. Network construction for text
Various criteria for the relation between terms of a list can be used to create its network. Co-occurrence, syntactic and
semantic dependencies are applied in network construction for a text. Word types are represented as vertices in the co-
occurrence network of a text and therewill be a link between the nearest neighbors. In the extracted co-occurrence network,
the number of nodes, Nn, is equal to vocabulary size of the text, Nv (Nn = Nv); whereas the number of links, Nl, is less than
or equal to text size, Nt (Nl ≤ Nt). If the beginning of the text is connected to its end, the total strength of the corresponding
weighted co-occurrence network will be identical to text size; that is,

i,j aij = Nt in the directed-weighted network and
i<j aij = Nt in the undirected-weighted one. The number of links, in the unweighted co-occurrence network of a text,
shows number of its distinct word bigrams. In Fig. 1 we represent an undirected-unweighted co-occurrence network and an
adjacency matrix for an example short text. The network structure of each book and then its writing style can be uncovered
by means of different measurable quantities. Up to now, several measurable quantities have been defined to investigate
different features of the networks.We apply the characteristic length, the average of degree, degree distribution, the average
of nearest neighbors degree and the average of clustering coefficient for authorship attribution, which are briefly described
in Appendix A.
2.2. Another scaling law for author’s oeuvres
Heaps’ law is an important empirical law in linguistics, which states that the vocabulary will keep growing with corpus
size [4]. In other words, this law determines how the size of the inverted index will scale with the size of the corpus. Heaps’
law has a cumulative nature and indicates a power law relation between length of various fractions of a corpus and their
vocabulary size. It is clear that the larger fractions will certainly contain all word tokens of smaller fractions. Hence, the
vocabulary set of short fractions of a corpus is a subset of the vocabulary set of its long fractions (Fig. 2-(a)). In the general
case, Heaps’ law implies a power law relation between the number of distinct types and the collection size. In the context of
network theory, the inverse Heaps’ law explains the relationship between number of links and number of nodes: Nl ≈ Nnβ .
Meanwhile, during this work we observe another interesting regularity in the co-occurrence network of every author’s
works. We find a power law relationship, with a certain scaling exponent (α-exponent) for each writer, between number of

there is life’’, with Nn = Nv = 5,Nl = 6 and Nt = 7. The punctuation marks and numbers should be excluded before the network construction process.
The head and tail of the text are also connected.

links (Nl) and number of nodes (Nn), in the co-occurrence network extracted for his/her every book: Nl ≈ Nnα . This scaling
exponent can be used as a new lexical feature in authorship identification. It is worth noting that this law differs fromHeaps’
law, because the new scaling law does not have a cumulative nature and it talks about power law dependency between the
number ofword bigrams in various productions of a single author as a function of their vocabulary size. In this case, a specific
book does not necessarily contain all word tokens of another one. This means that the vocabulary set of each book will not
necessarily be a subset of another book (Fig. 2-(b)). In practice, the calculating α-exponent requires lower computational
effort, being its principal merits.
2.3. Authorship attribution probability
It is convenient to assign a vector to each author containing average properties of his/her accessible oeuvres network.
Now, suppose there is a list of authors containing properties of their handwritings’ networks. On the other hand, we have a
bookwith an unknown author and ourmain goal is its author identification. At first, we should calculate network properties
of the unknown book. In the rest of the section, we will introduce a probabilistic approach for authorship attribution. The
measurement attribution probability for every measurement, pa(m), can be defined as
pa(m) = 1 −
|Mx(m) − Ma(m)|
Na
a′=1
|Mx(m) − Ma′(m)|
(1)
where the index a refers to an author andm denotes a certainmeasurement. |Mx(m)−Ma(m)| is distance between the value
of considered measurement for unknown book, Mx(m), and its value for a specific author Ma(m). This distance is divided
by the sum of all such distances for the authors of our list. Na stands for the number of authors which exist in the list.
pa(m) will be the authorship attribution probability provided by a single measurement of the book’s network. For the sake
of higher accuracy, we combine attribution probability of several measurements. Since the network features discussed here
have distinct natures and refer to different concepts, it is acceptable to assume they are statistically independent of each
other. Therefore, the total authorship attribution probability, pa, is defined as themultiplication of these singlemeasurement
attribution probabilities,
pa = N
Nm
m=1
pa(m) (2)
where Nm denotes the number of applied measurements in the authorship attribution process and N is a normalization
factor defined by

combination of more textual features can lead to a better result. In the next section, we will perform an experiment to test
our authorship identification method.
3. Experiment
In a procedure for the evaluation of the method, we adopt thirty six books of five famous Persian writers, Bahayi, Iqbal,
Molavi, Nezami and Salman. These litterateurs are selected from different periods to study the time evolution of the Persian
language network structure. Table 1 contains life period, activity field and adopted books for each author. Most of these
books are freely available on Ganjoor’s website [26].
In the first stage, we mapped all words to lowercase and exclude all punctuation marks and numbers from all texts.
A simple whitespace-based tokenization applied for delimitation word tokens [27]. Then, we construct an undirected-
unweighted co-occurrence network for each book without any lemmatization. Now it is possible to extract some structural
features for each book. To classify the degree distribution of extracted networks, we employ q-exponential distribution as
a generalization of ordinary power law distribution. We depict the cumulative degree distribution data of the book fihe-
ma-fih written by Molavi as a typical representative text, and fit results with the q-exponential function and power law
function in Fig. 3. As seen in the figure, the behavior of degree distribution is better described by the q-exponential function.
The q-parameter is obtained by fitting the cumulative degree distribution with the cumulative q-exponential function. The
q-exponential distribution and its application in the analysis of degree distribution is briefly illustrated in the Appendix B.
As we explained in the previous section, there is a power law dependency between the number of links and the
number of nodes in the co-occurrence network of each book: Nl ≈ Nnα . We apply the following numerical method to
estimate power law exponent, α, for each author. Let us assume Nb books of a particular author are accessible. We first
extract the number of links and number of nodes for each book, and then we calculate Nb α-exponents by use of Nb − 1

r2 = 0.988 and std.err. = 0.086. The empirical data are better fitted with the q-exponential function, especially for small degrees.

data points in each fitting process. Hence, we should eliminate one of the Nb books and find the α-exponent for the
remaining Nb − 1 books by fitting with a power law model function. Then we calculate the average α-exponent and its
standard deviation for the selected author. The value of α-exponent differs from author to author because of their different
writing styles. Therefore, we will use this exponent for authorship characterization in the next section. Note that again, the
α-exponent fundamentally differs fromHeaps’β-exponent since they arise fromdifferent statistical concepts. Fig. 4 displays
the presented scaling law and Heaps’ law for Bahayi’s books as a representative author. In the curve of the new scaling law
every data point (blue diamond) belongs to a single book. For performing theHeaps’ law,we prepare a large corpus including
all of Bahayi’s books and then we extract a number of nodes in the co-occurrence network constructed for various fractions
of this corpus. The empirical data for the new scaling law and the Heaps’ law are well fitted with power law functions,
respectively with exponents α = 1.18 (blue dashed line in the left graph) and β = 1.33 (red dotted line in the right graph).
We calculate the average of network quantities and their standard deviation for every author’s literary works. Average
of nearest neighbors, degree, clustering coefficient, characteristic length, q-parameter, α-exponent and their standard
deviation are reported in the Table 2. We use these features for authorship identification with the presented probabilistic
method. In the attribution probability calculation for each book, its features have been excluded when obtaining average
features of its author.

4. Results and discussion
We report authorship attribution probability of all thirty six adopted books written by five mentioned Persian authors
in the Table 1. The maximum attribution probability of each book is highlighted with bold numbers. The attribution
probability for Bahayi, Iqbal, Molavi, Nezami and Salman are denoted by pB, pI , pM , pN and pS respectively. All of Bahayi
and Molavi’s books are successfully attributed to their right author. Apart from an exception, all of Iqbal and Nezami’s
books are also truly attributed. In the case of Salman’s books, the attribution process successfully attributes just two of
his books. In all eight unsuccessful cases, the attribution probability of the correct author does not have the maximum
value but it has one of the highest values. Furthermore, if the authors have similar writing styles, then the accuracy
of authorship attribution will decrease. The standard error has a crucial effect on the ability of a particular feature in
authorship identification. A quantity with a smaller error will have a better result in this procedure. On the other hand,
applying more books to extract network features for each author provides more accurate attribution. The identification
accuracy rate of authorship attribution methods shows their prediction power. The common form of the accuracy can be
written as
Accuracy =
TP + TN
TP + TN + FP + FN
(3)
where TP, TN, FP and FN are the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives and false negatives in the attribution
procedure [28].
• True Positive: Number of books truly attributed to the right author.
• True Negative: Number of books truly not attributed to the wrong author.
• False Positive: Number of books falsely attributed to the wrong author.
• False Negative: Number of books falsely not attributed to the right author.
From Table 1, we immediately see that TP = 28, TN = 136, FP = 8, and FN = 8. Therefore, the accuracy level reached with
network features is 91%. This fact confirms the ability of network features in authorship analysis. It is worth remarking that
some factors including the number of candidate authors, the number and the size of available known texts have a crucial
effect on the accuracy rate of attribution methods [22].
Resolution power of textual features in authorship characterization determines their ability in this way. The main idea
is the distinction between different authors by means of relations between two or more features of the text. The resolution
power of themutual relation between all mentioned features for five selected authors is displayed in Fig. 5. The combination
of α-exponent and q-parameter has acceptable resolution power in authorship characterization. One notes that, in other
characterization problems the combination of some other features may be required to achieve high resolution power and
accurate results.
5. Conclusion
We have studied human written texts by means of complex networks theory to present new features for authorship
analysis. Networks produced for each author’s books have specific features related to his/her writing style, which can
be used to reveal text authorship. As a new feature, we addressed a power law relation between the number of links
(distinct word bigrams) and the number of nodes (distinct words), in the undirected-unweighted co-occurrence network
of text. In an experiment with thirty six books of five Persian litterateurs, the presented structural features have been
used in authorship attribution process without any lemmatization in the texts. Reliable accuracy of our results shows
that the presented network features are applicable in authorship analysis. The combination of some network properties
with high resolution power provides an appropriate method for authorship characterization. Here the combination of
α-exponent and q-parameter (nonextensivity measure) has an acceptable resolution for authorship characterization. In
order to improve the analysis accuracy, these network features can be combined with other textual features in language
analysis.
It is worth pointing out that we can use the same strategy for investigation on the nucleotide sequences in order to
characterize their role or functionality. The same method may also be applied in analyzing time series. The time series
contain important information about complex systems. The translation of a time series to an alphabetical sequence [29]
allows us to construct their corresponding networks and describe the peculiarities of such systems in terms of network
metrics.

Appendix A. Some structural features of networks
In a connected network every vertex is reachable from any other vertex by following the links in the network. The path
length between two connected vertices i and j is the number of links from vertex i to reach vertex j. The shortest path length
between vertices i and j is denoted as lij and its average over all network vertices will be the characteristic length of the
network
l̄ =
1
Nn(Nn − 1)
Nn
i,j=1
lij. (A.1)
The degree of a vertex i is the number of links incident on it: ki =
Nn
j=1 aij. We are interested in asymptotic regularities
in the network as a large statistical system. The degree distribution p(k) of a network seems to be a convenient function to
display the global behaviors. p(k) is defined as the probability that a randomly chosen vertex has degree k. It is easy to see
2436 A. Mehri et al. / Physica A 391 (2012) 2429–2437
that the average of degree for a network k̄will be
k̄ =
1
Nn
Nn
i=1
ki =
kmax
kmin
kp(k) (A.2)
where kmin and kmax are minimum and maximum values of degree in the network. It is shown that in many natural
systems degree distribution represents power law behavior. We use q-exponential distribution, as a generalized power
law distribution, to analyze degree distribution. A brief description about the derivation of q-exponential distribution is
provided in the Appendix B.
The degree correlation between adjacent vertices provides an excellent evidence of structural ordering in the network.
Inspired by Markovian approximation, the simplest degree correlation can be defined by two-point conditional probability
p(k′|k), as a probability of the existence of a link between two vertices with degrees k′ and k. In the practical cases at first,
people compute the average of nearest neighbors degree for every node in the network: knn,i =

j∈V (i) kj/ki, where the set
V (i) contains its nearest neighbors. The average of knn,i over the network vertices will be
k̄nn =
1
Nn
Nn
i=1
knn,i. (A.3)
The tendency to form cliques in the neighborhood of the network vertices is referred to as its clustering. The clustering
coefficient ci of a given vertex i is defined as the ratio of the number of links between the neighbors of i and the maximum
number of such links: ci = [

j,l aijajlali]/[ki(ki − 1)]. According to this definition, ci lies in the range 0 6 ci 6 1. It will be
zero for ki 6 1. Now, the average clustering coefficient of a network can be written as
c̄ =

Appendix B. Tsallis statistics for text mining
From the physical viewpoint, a text can be considered as a one-dimensional complexmany-body system partitioned to a
finite number of sections and each section contains a single element. The elements of the text (Nt words) are distributed in a
special routine to produce an especial concept. The traditional statistical mechanics is unable to provide a useful description
of this type of systems with finite size and long range correlation, due to their nonextensivity [30]. Tsallis proposed a novel
formalism for nonextensive statistics, as a generalization of Boltzmann–Gibbs–Shannon (BGS) standard statistics, to explain
the anomalous behaviors of such nonextensive systems [31,32]. In this context, for discrete degree distribution of vertices
in the co-occurrence network of a text, Tsallis nonextensive entropy, as the main core of his formalism, can be written in
the following way:
Sq ≈
1 −
kmax
k=kmin
pqk
q − 1
(B.1)
where kmin, kmax and pk stand for minimum degree, maximum degree and the escort probability of finding a vertex with
k links. Parameter q is determined by the microscopic dynamics of the system of interest and characterizes its degree of
nonextensivity. In the limit as q → 1, the extensive BGS entropy is recovered. The stationary probability distribution, pk, is
obtained by the maximization of Tsallis entropy under appropriate constraints. In this case, the probability normalization
and the expectation value of degree, in the undirected-unweighted co-occurrence network constructed for text, are imposed
on the system.
kmax
k=kmin
pk = 1 (B.2)
kmax
k=kmin
kpk =

Nn
. (B.3)
Under these assumptions, we obtain a well knownmodification of Zipf–Mandelbrot power law distribution, which is called
q-exponential distribution in the context of nonextensive statistical mechanics.
pk ≈ [1 − (1 − q)β ′k]

1−q (B.4)
where β ′ is the Lagrange parameter associated with the expectation value constraint. The q-exponential function tends to
the ordinary exponential function in the q → 1 limit. In real cases, step-like noises are often seen in the tail of the probability
distribution as a result of the same value for probability of the rare events. In fitting empirical data with a model function,
the noisy tail causes inconvenient results. To avoid the irregularities, instead of working with escort probability of a certain
A. Mehri et al. / Physica A 391 (2012) 2429–2437 2437
state of the system under consideration, we focus on the probability that an outcome is larger than a certain state, Pi, which
is called cumulative distribution.
Pk =
kmax
k′=k
pk′ = [1 − (1 − q)β ′k]

1−q +1. (B.5)
The exact result of summation in Eq. (B.5) is not a differentiable function. Therefore, we use its continuum limit
approximation. The cumulative distribution of the escort probability distribution has still the q-exponential form. Degree
distribution data fit with the q-exponential function better than the ordinary power law function. Accordingly, we have used
the nonextensivity measure in the authorship attribution process.
