RESEARCH
Timeprints for identifying social media 
users with multiple aliases
Fredrik Johansson1*†, Lisa Kaati1,2† and Amendra Shrestha2†
Abstract 
Many people who discuss sensitive or private issues on social media services are using pseudonyms or aliases in order 
to not reveal their true identity, while using their usual, non-private accounts when posting messages on less sensitive 
issues. Previous research has shown that if those individuals post large amounts of user-generated content, stylomet-
ric techniques can be used to identify the author based on the characteristics of the textual content. In this article 
we show how an author’s identity can be unmasked in a similar way using various time features (e.g., period of the 
day and the day of the week when a user’s posts have been published). We combine several different time features 
into a timeprint, which can be seen as a type of fingerprint when identifying users on social media. We use supervised 
machine learning (i.e., author identification) and unsupervised alias matching (similarity detection) in a number of dif-
ferent experiments with forum data to get an understanding of to what extent timeprints can be used for identifying 
users in social media, both in isolation and when combined with stylometric features. The obtained results show that 
timeprints indeed can be a very powerful tool for both author identification and alias matching in social media.

Introduction
An increasing amount of many people’s life is spent 
online. People are using Internet and social media in 
order to communicate, express their opinions and beliefs, 
discuss topics of interest to them, etc. While much of 
the information is expressed publicly, there is also more 
sensitive information available in web forums and other 
social media services that potentially could be harmful 
to the author if it became widely known who the physi-
cal person behind the user that is posting information 
is in reality. There are many examples from the Security 
Informatics research community related to the analysis 
of terrorist activities on the Web (see e.g., [1–3]), such as 
the spreading of extremism propaganda and discussions 
on how to make improvised explosive devices. In such 
settings, it can be of fundamental importance to intelli-
gence analysts to find out what a person writes and who 
the physical person behind some pieces of texts really is. 
Similarly, it can be highly relevant for the police to find 
out who the author behind anonymous posts in a cyber-
crime investigation really is by linking the anonymized 
social media account to non-anonymized postings or 
accounts. This is the main motivation and driving factor 
for the research presented in this article. However, the 
Web is, fortunately, not only used for activities related to 
terrorism or crime. Ordinary citizens may also want to 
preserve their anonymity when discussing private issues 
such as religion, sexual preferences, political ideas, dis-
eases, etc. in public. Obviously, what is considered as 
private and sensitive information varies from country to 
country and individual to individual. Many people would 
like to be able to freely express their ideas and beliefs, 
while at the same time avoid revealing their true iden-
tity to e.g., friends, employers, commercial companies, 
police, or intelligence services.
A quite common approach to reach some kind of ano-
nymity when discussing sensitive issues online is to make 
use of “anonymous” or “alter ego” social media accounts 
when posting user generated content of private nature, 
while using other accounts for non-sensitive postings. A 
rather obvious problem with such an approach is that the

Internet service provider and social media service can log 
the IP-address and help identifying the user from this 
information, unless the providers can be fully trusted by 
the user or if extra counter-measures are applied, such as 
logging in from various Internet cafes or making use of 
tools such as Tor1 [4]. There are, however, also less obvi-
ous problems with such an approach. It has for a long 
time been known that stylometric techniques can be 
used to identify an author among a small set of candidate 
authors given a large enough data material, but more 
recent research experiments presented in [5] suggest that 
this can be accomplished with reasonable accuracy also 
on large-scale datasets. A user who is aware of such tech-
niques can in theory obfuscate their writing style inten-
tionally, e.g., by using methods similar to those suggested 
in [6–8], but this is probably quite unusual.
In our previous work [9], we implemented a subset 
of the features suggested in [5] and used them for alias 
matching (i.e., the problem of identifying multiple aliases 
belonging to the same individual in an unsupervised fash-
ion). In addition to the use of stylometric features we also 
used time as a feature to increase the possibility to detect 
users with multiple aliases. As the use of stylometric fea-
tures sometimes is referred to as a user’s “writeprint” in 
the sense that it can be compared to a fingerprint when it 
comes to identifying a person, we are here using the term 
“timeprint” when referring to how various time features 
can be used to identify a person. A timeprint can be seen as 
a property that reflect something about the characteristics 
of an individual’s activity and her habits. In our previous 
work the timeprints were based on the publishing times 
when a user post messages, capturing the distribution of 
messages over the hour-of-the-day. By using timeprints in 
combination with stylometry, the detection rate of finding 
multiple aliases has been shown to increase significantly 
[9]. In this article, we are exploring various time features 
in more depth in order to increase the quality of timeprints 
and in order to find out how successfully they can be used 
for author identification and alias matching. One of the 
reasons why we are investigating to what extent timeprints 
can be used to identify a user is due to the fact that in some 
cases the publishing time is the only thing that is present, 
in particular in cases where users post images or videos 
with illegal content such as child pornography. Another 
reason is that a person’s timeprint can be expected to be 
quite uncorrelated to her writeprint, making it possible to 
combine the two into a more powerful feature set.
We explore time features by explorative studies and 
experiments using the ICWSM forum dataset, contain-
ing data from an Irish forum site.2 We show that a set of 
1 https://www.torproject.org/.
2 https://www.boards.ie/.
time features can be powerful for unmasking an author’s 
identity in both a supervised (author identification) and 
an unsupervised (alias matching or similarity detection) 
setting. Additionally, we make experiments to find out 
which impact the amount of available posts and the way 
we split the posts into sub-users have on the resulting 
accuracy.
The rest of this article is structured as follows: in 
“Author identification and alias matching”, we define the 
problems of author identification and alias matching, and 
present related work. In “Timeprints and activity pro-
files”, we present various time features which potentially 
can be useful components of a timeprint, and show how 
the time features are varying among different users and 
over time for the Irish forum data. Moreover, we explain 
the concept of “circadian topology” or “chronotype” as a 
motivation for why people can be expected to have time-
prints which are different from other individuals’ time-
prints. Next, we describe the experimental setup that has 
been used in our experiments on synthetically generated 
data in “Experimental setup”. This section is followed 
up with the actual machine learning experiments, pre-
sented in “Experiments on author identification”. In these 
experiments, we evaluate how well a classifier can learn 
to predict the correct author or user among a larger set of 
potential candidates by using time features. Hence, this is 
an example of how the classic problem of author identifi-
cation can be tackled using non-textual features only. In 
“Experiment on alias matching”, the usefulness of using 
timeprints for alias matching is evaluated and compared 
to stylometric-based features. In the case of alias match-
ing we compare each user identity to all other identities 
and group together users (aliases) which are more similar 
than a certain threshold. In “Discussion”, we briefly dis-
cuss under which circumstances the obtained results can 
be expected to hold in “the wild” and which implications 
our experimental results are likely to have. Finally, we 
present some conclusions and directions for future work 
in “Conclusions and future work”.
Author identification and alias matching
Author identification, also known as authorship attribu-
tion, can be defined as the problem of assigning a text 
of unknown authorship to one candidate author, given 
a set of candidate authors for whom texts of undisputed 
authorship are available [10]. Authorship identification 
is a fairly well-studied problem, where algorithms and 
various features have been extensively described in, e.g., 
[5, 11–13]. However, existing approaches rely on linguis-
tic/stylometric features (lexical, syntactic, idiosyncratic, 
etc.), while we in this article mainly study the usefulness 
of time features based on when texts have been written 
or published. To the best of our knowledge, time features 
Page 3 of 11Johansson et al. Secur Inform  (2015) 4:7 
have not previously been used for author identification 
purposes except for in [14], which the work presented in 
this article is an extension of. Clearly, information about 
time is not always available, but when analyzing posts 
from social media (e.g., Twitter, web forums, etc.), such 
information can often be extracted.
In the author identification problem we compare each 
anonymous user to a fixed set of pre-defined known 
entities. In this way, we assume that the anonymous user 
is one of the exhaustive list of candidate authors pre-
sent in the training set. This kind of problem setting can 
for example be of interest in a criminal investigation in 
which threatening messages have been received from a 
specific computer or IP-address to which only a limited 
number of suspects have access. Now, given that we can 
retreive the publishing times of the threatening mes-
sages, we can construct timeprints and writeprints from 
the threatening messages and compare them to time-
prints and writeprints extracted from blog posts, tweets, 
forum posts, etc. written in user-generated content on 
social media using the suspects’ known social media 
accounts.
In an alias matching setting (described in more detail 
in [9]), we cannot assume that we have knowledge of all 
potential authors. The (intra-platform) alias matching 
problem is instead to compare each anonymous identity 
to all other identities and group together users (aliases) 
which are more similar than a certain threshold. Hence, 
while author identification can be seen as a supervised 
machine learning problem, alias matching is an unsu-
pervised problem where the same supervised algorithms 
cannot be used. Instead, we are for the alias matching 
problem making use of a vector space-representation 
for the various aliases, where each feature corresponds 
to a single dimension in the vector space. Next, we make 
use of a distance function (in our case cosine similarity, 
although other alternatives such as Manhattan distance 
could be used) to calculate the similarity among the 
various aliases. In addition to publishing time, i.e., time-
prints, there are also other kinds of features which can be 
used for alias matching. One obvious candidate is the use 
of stylometric features. In this work we compare the use-
fulness of stylometric features and timeprints, as well as 
their combination.
Usernames is another feature that can be consid-
ered when linking multiple aliases to each other. In [15] 
an attempt to link user accounts across different social 
media services is presented. The authors show empiri-
cally that in almost 60% of the cases, people use the same 
username in all social media platforms they are part of. A 
more sophisticated study is presented by Perito et al. [16]. 
They also consider usernames for linking user accounts 
but have instead developed a model for estimating that 
two usernames from two separate social media ser-
vices belong to the same individual. In their approach a 
Markov chain model trained on approximately 10 mil-
lion usernames gathered from Google and eBay is used 
to estimate a probability of how common tho usernames 
are. Although both these studies are very interesting, 
usernames would hardly be as useful for situations where 
people actively would try to hide who they are when 
making sensitive postings, which is the main reason for 
not including them in this study. In [17], a supervised 
method for finding mappings among identities of indi-
viduals across social media sites is introduced. While 
the methods suggested in [15, 16] make use of only one 
and two features, respectively, extracted from the user-
names, the MOBIUS approach in [17] builds upon a large 
set of features extracted from the usernames (including 
the ones suggested in [15, 16]). Many classification tech-
niques are evaluated in their experiments, but a logistic 
regression classifier is shown to perform best (with an 
accuracy of 93.8%). This classifier performs much better 
than the methods suggested in [15, 16] as well as a num-
ber of baselines (such as exact username matching and 
substring matching). Overall, the most important fea-
tures in MOBIUS are the standard deviations of the nor-
malized edit distance and normalized longest common 
substring between the candidate username and prior 
usernames, and the username observation likelihood, but 
in total more than 400 features extracted from the candi-
date usernames, observed prior usernames, and relations 
between the candidate username and the prior user-
names are used by the classifier. The results are impres-
sive, but are not likely to work well in  situations where 
people actively are trying to avoid their usernames being 
linked to their physical identity.
Another type of approach to detect “split identities” 
of web authors is presented in [18]. They argue that fea-
ture extraction and machine learning on Web scale is 
very costly and does not scale well, since pages or post-
ings written by the same author can be similar in many 
different ways (demanding large feature sets). Instead, 
they suggest using (open source) compression software 
for extracting the compression distance for pairs of web 
pages, hypothesizing “that every author has a unique 
compression signature that is similar across all the pages 
of the same author”. Technically speaking, they make use 
of a two-sided normalized compressor distance (NCD) 
which measures how much the compression of each of 
two pairs of web pages is improved by using information 
in the other web page. The resulting distances are then 
used to cluster web pages, where the aim is to group all 
pages written by the same author in a common cluster. 
As shown in our experiments, our method can be applied 
to datasets containing quite a large number of users 
Page 4 of 11Johansson et al. Secur Inform  (2015) 4:7 
(although it obviously is a difference between a few thou-
sand users and “Web scale”).
Another approach to identify users with multiple ali-
ases on social media services that has been suggested 
in existing literature is to make use of social network 
analysis (SNA). In [19], a social network based on aliases 
(email addresses collocated on the same web pages) is 
constructed. Depending on the number of web pages that 
the aliases are co-occurring on, the network is weighted 
and the the geodesic distance is computed. Social net-
works can potentially be used in other ways for linking 
multiple aliases as well, for example to construct a social 
network based on communication patterns or what top-
ics an alias is writing about, as suggested in [9, 20].
In [21], the framework HYDRA is proposed for ena-
bling large-scale social identity linkage across social 
media platforms. According to the authors, such link-
age would allow for more complete and consistent user 
information when profiling users. HYDRA consists of 
two main components: one for measuring the hetero-
geneous behavior similarity between users and one for 
leveraging users’ core social network structures. These 
components are combined using multiobjective opti-
mization. In the behavior similarity calculation, many 
features are taken into account including a comparison 
of user profile images, various textual attributes from 
the users’ profiles, and a rudimentary modeling of writ-
ing style (based on extraction of the most unique words 
of each user). The authors have been able to verify their 
suggested method on impressively large datasets (several 
million Chinese users with accounts on several social 
networks obtained from a third-party data provider). 
The results show that HYDRA outperforms the other 
approaches, which is unsurprisingly since the other 
approaches take fewer sets of features (mostly user-
names) into account.
Although there are many different approaches to 
author identification and social media linkage suggested 
in existing research literature, there are to the best of our 
knowledge no previous attempts to make use of publish-
ing times, except for our previous papers [9, 14], which 
this article is an extension of.
Timeprints and activity profiles
A chronotype or a circadian typology is an individual 
difference in personality, which is believed to be the 
cause of why some individuals prefer to work and exer-
cise in the morning hours while others prefer evening 
hours. In 1976, Horne and Östberg published a 19-item 
morningness-eveningness questionnaire  [22] that was 
used to measure if a person was a morning or evening 
person. The questionnaire has been validated in many 
countries with regards to local cultures and ages. Apart 
from the morningness-eveningness questionnaire, cir-
cadian typology has been described and measured using 
different questionnaires in many studies and several 
countries [23].
Circadian preferences are based on genetic influence. 
The circadian typology classifies individuals according to 
three different types: morning-type, evening-type, and 
neither-type. Most people are neither-types and are posi-
tioned somewhere between evening or morning types 
while half of the population are either morning-types or 
evening-types. It has been noted that people who have 
the same chronotype have similar activity pattern timing: 
they prefer to sleep, eat and exercise during more or less 
the same hours. The circadian typology seems to have 
an impact on the behavior of an individual and various 
studies have for example suggested that evening types 
spend more time in front of the screen [24] or that even-
ing types have a higher tendency for cigarette craving and 
alcohol usage [25].
When a person is active or not on social media services 
may also be correlated to the person’s chronotype. In a 
discussion forum such as boards.ie, it is possible that a 
morning-type individual post most of her messages 
during the morning hours, while an evening-type pre-
fers posting messages during the evening. In addition to 
chronotypes, there are other aspects that affects when a 
user is active on social media. These factors are related 
to the living situation of a person, for example factors 
such as during what hours a person is at work, what time 
zone the person lives in, when a person has vacation and 
what kind of occupation the person has all matter when 
it comes to usage of social media. Altogether there are 
several distinguished features that are characteristic for a 
user’s social media usage.
To obtain an understanding on how users behave, and 
investigate if there are some features that seem to be 
more characteristic than others when it comes to activity 
of a user, we studied the time-based activity patterns of a 
set of randomly selected users that were active in the dis-
cussion board. Figure 1 shows a randomly selected user’s 
distribution of posts throughout a day. As can be noted 
in the figure, it seems to be the case that this user has a 
quite similar behavior of when he/she is active and not 
throughout all 5 years that are compared. When analyz-
ing users’ activity during various time intervals we noted 
that the activity pattern or time profile of a user seemed 
to be quite specific for each of the selected users. We also 
noted that the activity of a user seemed to be consistent 
over time (using data from different years). This might 
have to do with the fact most people are creature of habit 
and unconsciously prefer to do the same things during 
the same hours and periods. Some of the features that we 
considered in our manual analysis were:
Page 5 of 11Johansson et al. Secur Inform  (2015) 4:7 
  • Activity during each month
  • Activity during each hour of the day
  • Activity during each day of week
  • Activity during weekdays and weekends
  • Activity during 4-h intervals (early morning, morn-
ing, midday, evening, night, midnight).
Figure  2 shows the distribution of messages (posts in 
the discussion board) in 4-h intervals for a single user in 
the boards.ie dataset. Each number on the x-axis repre-
sents a 4 h interval where 1, 00.00–03.59; 2, 04.00–07.59; 
and so on. The same user has been active during 2003–
2007, and the distribution of messages is shown for each 
year. As can be noted in the figure, this user seems to 
have a consistent behavior when it comes to distribution 
of messages over the years. The fact that the behavior 
seems to be consistent over the years and that the pattern 
for each user seems to be somewhat unique is something 
that has been noted previously. How the behaviors and 
patterns can be used for author identification and alias 
matching is studied in more detail in later sections, but 
let us first see how such activity patterns have been uti-
lized in related literature.
In [26], a temporal analysis of the blogosphere was 
done. The assumption was that each blogger has a dif-
ferent preference for posting. A dataset consisting of 
nearly 700,000 blog articles was analyzed according to 
two factors: (1) day of the week and (2) time of the day. 
One of the conclusions in the paper is that each blogger 
has a different temporal preference for posting which 
supports our thoughts that different discussion board 
users have different preferences for posting, and there-
fore will have timeprints that differ from each other. In 
[27], a double-chain hidden Markov model is used to 
characterize individuals’ behavior in e-mail communi-
cation. The results show that users fall into two well-
separated clusters: “day laborers” and “e-mailaholics”. 
Given these clusters it is shown that a vast majority of 
the users retain their routines over an extended period 
of time.
The above studies indicate that timeprints may be use-
ful for separating users to some degree, but the experi-
ments presented in the following sections investigate this 
possibility much more thoroughly.
Experimental setup
We have conducted a number of different experiment 
to understand how well timeprints perform on the two 
problems of author identification and alias matching. In 
our experiments we have made use of the following sets 
of features when constructing our timeprints:
  • Hour of Day Hour1, Hour2, ..., Hour24
  • Period of Day MidNight, EarlyMorning, Morning, 
MidDay, Evening, Night
  • Month Jan, Feb, ..., Dec
  • Day Sunday, Monday, ..., Saturday
  • Type of Day WeekDay, WeekEnd.
In the construction phase we go through each post 
made by an alias/user. We count the number of occur-
rences of each attribute and then express the val-
ues as relative frequencies, so that the values of each 
set of attributes sums to 1 (e.g., WeekDay = 0.65 and

WeekEnd = 0.35). The relative frequencies obtained from 
individual posts are then averaged into a single timeprint 
for each alias.
In some of our experiments we also combine our time-
print with stylometric features which are calculated in the 
same way. The stylometic features that we use are sum-
marized in Table 1 and consist of various features which 
are supposed to be able to help distinguishing between 
various users without being sensitive to the actual topic 
of the text. We have in our stylometric implementation 
included a subset of the features used in the article by 
Narayanan et al. [5] plus an extra feature: the relative fre-
quency of various smileys. As for the timeprints, the val-
ues for each set of stylometric features sum to 1. A lot of 
other features could have been used, including lexical fea-
tures such as vocabulary richness [e.g., using frequency 
of hapax legomena (once-occuring words) or Yule’s K 
measure], syntactic features such as part-of-speech tag 
n-grams, and idiosyncratic features such as misspelled 
words. We are not arguing that we have used the richest 
set of features possible, but rather that we have incorpo-
rated a lot of useful features that reasonably fast can be 
extracted from forum posts. The present features can be 
extended in the future to allow for even better stylomet-
ric “writeprints”.
While we ultimately would have preferred to run our 
experiments on real-world data in which a subset of the 
users were known to make use of multiple aliases, such 
data is very hard to get hold of for research purposes 
and also raise ethical concerns. Instead, we have syn-
thetically created data based on posts extracted from 
the ICWSM boards.ie forum dataset. First of all, we have 
identified and extracted the posts for the 4000 users who 
have posted most posts in the forum during year 2007. 
The reason for choosing those users is that we wanted 
to have as large data material as possible, since a reason-
able assumption is that the amount of data will have an 
impact on the achieved results. This assumption is tested 
further in one of our experiments described below.
In our alias matching experiment we have from the 
set of top-posters first selected a smaller set of users 
(n = 500) (where the selection is based on the descending 
order of the users’ amount of posts). Each of these users 
have been split into two separate users uia and uib, where 
1 ≤ i ≤ 500 and posts are assigned randomly among user 
uia and user uib. The intention of this split is to simu-
late a user who make use of two separate aliases, with-
out assuming too much about the patterns in which the 
user will switch among the two aliases. Now, each user in 
the set {u1a,u2a,u3a, . . . ,una} is compared, one at a time, 
with all the users in the set B = {u1b,u2b,u3b, . . . ,unb}. 
Based on the results from the time-based matching we 
rank the members of set B according to how similar they 
are to the selected user (where the similarity among two 
vectors is calculated using cosine distance). The most 
similar member of the set B is ranked as number one, the 
next most similar as number two and so on. The reported 
accuracy is calculated as the fraction of times the index 
of the selected alias is found within the top-N rankings 
(where the results for N = 1 and N = 3 are reported). 
This kind of experiment has then been conducted for 
increasing values of the number of users n, where we 
have varied n from 500 to 4000 in steps of 500.
In the author identification experiments, we have only 
made use of the top-1000 users, since a larger set of 
potential classes would have been hard to cope with for 
the more complex classifiers that have been used. Each 
user ui has been split into five “sub-users” ui1,ui2, . . . ,ui5. 
The posts are in most of our experiments divided ran-
domly among the sub-users, but we have also made a 
separate experiment on how the results differ if the posts 
are divided sequentially rather than randomly (i.e., where 
the user’s first post has been assigned to ui1, the second 
post to ui2, etc.). The reason for using five sub-users is 
that we in this way construct several training instances 
for each user in order to facilitate the learning phase 
in our supervised learning experiments. Based on the 
extracted posts, timeprint vectors have been constructed 
(one for each sub-user). In the author identification 
experiments we incorporate the UserID ui as the target 
class. Hence, we have five (different) data instances for 
each UserID. In our supervised learning experiments we 
compare the accuracy for two popular supervised learn-
ing algorithms: a Naive Bayes (NB) classifier and a sup-
port vector machine (SVM) classifier [28]. For the author 
identification experiments we have made use of the Wai-
kato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) [29]. 
For the SVM classifier, we have used the nu-SVC classi-
fier from the libsvm package in WEKA. We have used 
a linear kernel with default parameter settings since 
this was shown to give better results than a radial basis 
function in our initial experiments. In each step we have

performed tenfold cross validation and the results from 
the ten folds have been averaged into a single accuracy 
value which is reported.
Experiments
As explained in the previous section, we have conducted 
a number of different experiments to understand to what 
extent timeprints can be used for author identification 
and for alias matching. In this section we describe the 
individual experiments in further detail and present the 
obtained results.
Experiments on author identification
In our first experiment, we have varied the number of 
potential authors from 200 to 1000 in steps of 200 as 
explained above. First, we have randomly divided a user’s 
posts among its five sub-users. After this, we have used 
tenfold cross validation in which a Naive Bayes and a 
support vector machine have been trained and evalu-
ated. We have then compared the obtained accuracies 
for the Naive Bayes and support vector machine clas-
sifiers. The results from the experiment are reported in 
Fig. 3 using the labels NBRand and SVMRand. Next, we 
have repeated the same experiment again, but this time 
we have distributed the posts sequentially among the five 
sub-users, rather than to distribute them randomly. These 
results are reported in Fig. 3 using the labels NBSeq and 
SVMSeq. Now, what is the reason for studying the effect 
of the way the sub-users are selected on the obtained 
results? The explanation to this is that it is hard to know 
exactly how someone would make use of several aliases. 
Would they first make a post using one of their aliases, 
then switch to a second, and so on? Would they first 
write a large number of posts using one account, then 
switch to the next, and so on? The answer is probably nei-
ther, and the exact behaviour is probably very different 
for different individuals and different purposes for why 
multiple aliases are used in the first place. For this reason, 
the sequential and random splits of posts are intended to 
be seen as two extreme points, where the sequential way 
of dividing the posts into sub-users is intended to give an 
upper bound on the classification accuracy that can be 
expected when using timeprints, while the random way 
of dividing posts is more challenging for the classifier and 
can be seen as a lower bound on what classification accu-
racy that can be obtained. In reality, we would expect 
the accuracy to be somewhere between these upper and 
lower bounds, depending on the individual and what she 
is using the multiple aliases for.
As can be seen when studying the results in Fig. 3, both 
classifiers perform well on the classification task, espe-
cially the SVM classifier. For 200 users the SVM classifier 
is achieving 100% accuracy on the sequentially gener-
ated data and the NB classifier is not far away from this 
result either. On larger problem instances, the SVM clas-
sifier is consistently outperforming the NB classifier with 
approximately 5–20% higher accuracy, but this comes 
with a price. The training and evaluation phase of the 
NB classifier took a few minutes while the last steps took 
days to perform for the SVM classifier on the standard 
computer we used for the experiments, due to the large 
number of classes.
As expected, higher accuracies are achieved when dis-
tributing posts sequentially rather than randomly among 
sub-users. This is expected since features such as Month 
will have very similar relative frequencies among sub-
users corresponding to the same user when dividing the 
posts sequentially. In a setting where people make use of 
several accounts sequentially (such as when having a “dis-
cussion” between two or more alter egos) the sequential 
approach make sense, while it probably is less realistic 
for more normal use of multiple aliases. For this reason 
we are in the rest of the experiments distributing posts 
among the sub-users in a random fashion, although this 
probably is closer to a lower bound on the accuracy.
In this experiment, the correct user is in more than 
nine out of ten cases selected when using the SVM, 
both when using the random and sequential approach 
to creating the timeprints. As can be seen, the accuracy 
is still over 90 % for the SVM classifier when increasing 
the number of users to 1000. The results are somewhat 
worse for the NB classifier, but are still impressive given 
the simple nature of the classifier. The achieved results 
imply that time features can be very useful for author

Fig. 3 Accuracy results from classification with a NB classifier and a

identification when having access to large amounts of 
data material. Those results are significantly higher than 
those obtained for author identification with textual (sty-
lometric) features on a forum dataset reported in [11]. It 
should however be noted that it is not the same forum 
datasets that have been used in those experiments, mak-
ing it hard to make a fair comparison between the results.
In order to find out which of the time-based features 
that are most important for the achieved classification 
performance, we have applied information gain, which 
is an entropy-based feature selection method [30]. The 
results vary somewhat depending on which number of 
users the measure is applied to, but in general we can see 
that attributes related to Period of Day (such as Night and 
Morning) receive highest average ranks, followed by the 
Type of Day (i.e., weekend or weekday). After this follows 
Months and Days, while the set of attributes which seem 
to be least useful is the Hour of Day.
An important part of the explanation to the decrease 
in accuracy when the number of potential authors is 
increased is obviously that there are more candidates to 
chose among for the classifiers, but a contributing factor 
may also be that there is less data material for the users 
further down in the list (since they are ordered based on 
their number of posts). To get a better understanding of 
what impact the amount of posts has on the results, we 
have in a second experiment modified the original data-
set so that we start out with randomly selecting only 
100 posts for each of the top-200 users. Since each user 
is decomposed into five sub-users, this means that the 
timeprint vectors are built from 20 posts each only. The 
number of users is kept fixed to 200 while we are increas-
ing the number of randomly selected posts in steps of 
100, until reaching 1400 posts (since the 200th user has 
written a total of 1484 posts). In effect, this experiment 
simulates a setting where only a restricted amount of data 
material is available for creating the timeprints. When 
adjusting the experiment in this manner, the results 
shown in Fig. 4 were obtained.
As can be seen in this figure the accuracy increases for 
both classifiers when the numbers of posts are increased 
and the SVM classifier consistently performs better than 
the NB classifier. When only 100 posts are randomly 
selected for 200 users, the accuracy is below 20  % for 
both classifiers. When the number of posts are increased 
to 500, the SVM classifier has an accuracy over 80  % 
while the NB classifier is just above 55 %. The SVM clas-
sifier reaches over 95  % accuracy when the number of 
posts is around 800 and slowly continues to increase. The 
figure gives a good idea of what amount of data that is 
needed to reach a specific accuracy level for the classi-
fiers, but please note that the although the shape of the 
curves is similar also for other number of users, the exact 
values will differ.
Experiment on alias matching
In our alias matching experiment, we have selected the 
top-4000 users from year 2007 and randomly splitted a 
user’s post into two equally sized users as explained in 
“Experimental setup”. Now, we have for each sub-user 
created three sets of feature vectors from its posts: (1) a 
timeprint vector, (2) a stylometric-based vector, and (3)

a combination of the timeprint feature vector and the 
stylometric-based feature vector. The results from this 
experiment are summarized in Fig.  5. As can be seen, 
both time-based and stylometric-based features work 
very well for a limited number of users, but as the num-
ber of users is increased the decrease in performance is 
less steep for the timeprints compared to the stylometric-
based features. Looking at the top-1 rankings (with top-3 
ranking within parantheses), time alone yields 100% 
(100%) for 500 users, 89.6% (94.4 %) for 2000 users, and 
70.6% (79.0%) for 4000 users. The corresponding results 
for stylometric features are 98.2% (99.2%) for 500 users, 
71.4 % (78.5%) for 2000 users, and 44.6% (51.7%) for 
4000 users. To combine both time-based and stylomet-
ric-based features seem to give better performance than 
using the individual time-based or stylometric-based fea-
tures on their own, and this effect seems to increase as 
the number of users is increased. More specifically, the 
corresponding results for the combination of time-based 
and stylometric-based features yield 100% (100%) for 500 
users, 93.0% (96.6%) for 2000 users, and 75.4 % (82.8%) 
for 4000 users. Based on these results we can conclude 
that time-based features are vey powerful on their own 
for alias matching and that combining time-based fea-
tures with stylometric-based features allow for even (sta-
tistically significantly) better results.
Discussion
The experimental results presented in the previous sec-
tion indicate that timeprints can be very useful for both 
author identification and alias matching. However, it 
should be noted that the results have been obtained in 
quite well-controlled experimental settings which does 
not necessarily hold true in a real-world environment. 
As have been shown in our experiment where we have 
used various ways to split users into sub-users (using ran-
dom and sequential splits), the effect on the results can 
be quite large. The effect of splitting users into sub-users 
has been discussed before in existing literature on stylo-
metric-based author identification [31, 32] but we are not 
aware of any previous studies on the effect on time-based 
author identification or alias matching.
In our alias matching experiments, we have been able 
to control so that posts have been evenly distributed 
among sets A and B. In a realistic setting, posts from two 
aliases belonging to the same individual could poten-
tially be more unevenly distributed, so that the posts for 
one alias could have been created during a completely 
other time period than the posts for the first alias. If this 
would be the case, this would have a negative impact on 
the obtained accuracy. Similarly, it can be expected that 
lower accuracy would be obtained for the author identi-
fication problem if the classifiers were applied on time-
prints based on posts from a different time period than 
they were trained on. Furthermore, it is expected that 
timeprints from the same individual obtained from vari-
ous social media platforms would look quite different 
from each other, even though they most likely would be 
correlated. For these reasons, the obvious next step is 
to attempt to evaluate the suggested algorithms on real-
world data obtained from various social media platforms. 
Although it is not straightforward how to do this, there 
are various ways in which evaluation on real datasets 
could be made. One such way would be to make intra-
platform experiments in which we attempt to find user 
accounts which are very similar to each other in terms of 
stylometric and time-based profiles and manually assess 
the matches to be either true or false positives, i.e., simi-
lar to the approach used in [33]. A drawback with such 
an evaluation is that only precision can be calculated, 
not recall. Another approach would be to try to get hold 
of a ground truth dataset based on uniquely identifying 
information such as e-mail addresses from a number of 
user accounts and use this as ground truth for whether 
two accounts should be matched. This would, however, 
only work for linking aliases across different social media 
services and would not be as suitable for evaluating 
how well we can detect users who actively try to remain 
anonymous.
In addition to the question of in which real-world set-
tings the suggested approach is expected to work well 
from a technical perspective, a very related question 
is in which situations it would be ethically acceptable 
to make use of alias matching and author identification 
techniques? We have no definitive answer to this, but 
as future (and already ongoing) work we intend to dis-
cuss this issue with a combination of law enforcement

combination of both

agencies, ethical philosophers, and IT law scholars. From 
our point of view, it would make sense from an ethical 
perspective to use this kind of techniques for author 
recognition purposes in a cyber crime investigation 
involving a few suspects, while it would be much more 
questionable to use it on large scale in an inter-platform 
setting which would allow for general dredging of pos-
sible matches. With this said, development of better and 
more exact guidelines for when this kind of techniques 
can and should be applied are left as future work.
For the author identification problem, we have split the 
available posts for a user into five separate training sam-
ples. This has proved to work quite well, but the number 
of training samples per user has been quite arbitrarily 
selected. The optimal value of training samples is prob-
ably dependent upon the number of potential authors as 
well as how much posts we have available for each user, 
but finding such an optimal value has been outside the 
scope of this article. However, as a rule of thumb, the 
more posts we have for a certain user, the more high-
quality training samples we can create.
One positive interpretation of results that have been 
obtained (if transferable to the real-world) is that police 
and intelligence services around the world can become 
more effective in finding the author of large quanti-
ties of terrorist propaganda and other crime- or terror-
ism-related content. A more negative interpretation is 
that the online anonymity of ordinary citizens in worst 
case may be weakened if this kind of techniques would 
be used by, e.g., commercial companies or repressive 
regimes. This raises the question of whether the use of 
time-based features can be defended against by an indi-
vidual who wants to preserve his or her anonymity. A 
potential solution could be to use software which does 
not publish posts directly as they are written, but rather 
delay the creation time of new posts randomly. However, 
it is unlikely that many people would make use of such 
techniques, which in practice will add the use of time-
prints (combined with stylometric features) as a potential 
attack vector on online anonymity.
Conclusions and future work
In this article, we have presented the idea that a user’s 
timeprint (which can be extracted from the publishing 
times of a large number of social media services) can be 
useful for identifying users who make use of multiple ali-
ases. This idea has been motivated by arguments such as 
the existence of individual differences in personality pref-
erences related to time (morning-type, evening-type, nei-
ther-type) and the fact that people have different working 
hours and sleeping hours. By selecting a few users and 
looking at their behavior over time we have noted that 
many users seem to have a quite stable activity behavior 
over time. Our initial manual analysis has indicated that 
there might be a possibility to tell individuals apart based 
on their timeprints. However, by just looking at a set of 
users’ behavior over time we can not say much about how 
unique a timeprint is.
To get a better understanding of the uniqueness of indi-
viduals’ timeprints, we have made supervised machine 
learning experiments where we have attempted to learn 
classifiers to tell users apart based on various time fea-
tures. This can be thought of as author identification 
based on activity rather than textual style. The results 
suggest that high accuracy can be obtained also for large 
number of potential authors (over 90 % up to 1000 users), 
but that the accuracy is highly dependent upon the num-
ber of posts from which the timeprints are created. In 
a second set of experiments, we have tested the useful-
ness of time features for the unsupervised alias match-
ing problem. We show that good performance can be 
achieved and that even better results are achieved when 
combining the time-based features with stylometric-
based features.
The results in the article are encouraging from an intel-
ligence and security perspective, but they might pose a 
threat towards privacy and online anonymity. If this kind 
of techniques can be used to reveal the true identity of 
a potential terrorist, there is a risk that the same tech-
niques can be used also for other purposes, even though 
the usefulness of the technique decline as the number of 
users is increased. One way to defend against the use of 
“timeprint attacks” could be to use tools that automate 
the process of publishing. A more drastic defense could 
be that some individuals choose to stop posting sensitive 
information at all, but this would obviously have poten-
tially severe consequences for democracy and individu-
als’ right to freedom.
Future work
In this article we have only considered users in a discus-
sion forum, but it is likely that the results can be trans-
ferred to other social media services as well. As future 
work we plan to test the usefulness of the developed 
timeprints on other social media services such as Twit-
ter. We also aim at cross-platform experiments, in which 
correlations among discussion forums and other social 
media services can be explored. Moreoever, we would 
like to carry out large-scale experiments like those in 
[5], where the full set of their stylometric features are 
combined with the timeprint features developed in this 
article.
Another direction for future work is to move on and 
make real-world experiments using the proposed algo-
rithms. Before this is done, it is however important 
to find out during which circumstances it is ethically 
Page 11 of 11Johansson et al. Secur Inform  (2015) 4:7 
acceptable to use alias matching and author identification 
on real data, both for research purposes and for use by 
police and security agencies. For this reason, we are cur-
rently undertaking a project in which law enforcement 
agencies, ethical philosophers, and IT law scholars are 
involved. The results from this work will influence how 
and if the proposed methods will be evaluated on real-
world data.
