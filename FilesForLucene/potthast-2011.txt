Abstract This paper overviews eleven plagiarism detectors that have been de-
veloped and evaluated within PAN’11. We survey the detection approaches de-
veloped for the two sub-tasks “external plagiarism detection” and “intrinsic pla-
giarism detection,” and we report on their detailed evaluation based on the third
revised edition of the PAN plagiarism corpus PAN-PC-11.
1 Introduction
Copying another author’s text and claiming its authorship is called plagiarism. While
research on automatic plagiarism detection has been conducted for decades, the stan-
dardized evaluation of plagiarism detection algorithms has a short history [13]. In this
regard we have organized three competitions on plagiarism detection, the latest one held
in conjunction with the 2011 CLEF conference. This paper overviews the submitted de-
tectors and evaluates their performances.
1.1 Plagiarism Detection
Let s = 〈splg, dplg, ssrc, dsrc〉 denote a plagiarism case where splg is a passage of doc-
ument dplg and a plagiarized version of some source passage ssrc in dsrc. Given dplg,
the task of a plagiarism detector is to detect s by reporting a corresponding plagia-
rism detection r = 〈rplg, dplg, rsrc, d′src〉. We say that r detects s iff splg ∩ rplg 6= ∅,
ssrc ∩ rsrc 6= ∅, and dsrc = d′src. This task can be tackled with external plagiarism
detection as well as with intrinsic plagiarism detection.
Algorithms for external plagiarism detection attempt to detect s by retrieving dsrc
from a document collection D (e.g., the web) and by extracting ssrc and splg from dsrc
and dplg based on a detailed comparison of the two documents. Algorithms for intrinsic
plagiarism detection attempt to detect s by analyzing the writing style of dplg, whereas
significant style variations from one passage to another may indicate that splg has been
written by a different author than the rest of dplg.

1.2 Evaluating Plagiarism Detectors
To evaluate plagiarism detectors we have developed an evaluation framework consist-
ing of the PAN plagiarism corpus 2011 (PAN-PC-11) and detection performance mea-
sures [13]. The framework was already employed in the 1st and 2nd competition on
plagiarism detection, and the corpus has been revised for this year. Table 1 gives an
overview of important corpus parameters. Notable changes compared to previous ver-
sions of the corpus include the significantly larger portion of plagiarism that is obfus-
cated by paraphrasing or translation, and the addition of manually translated plagiarism.
These changes are based on insights gained from last year’s competition, namely, that
verbatim plagiarism is detected without problems and that automatically translated pla-
giarism is detected too easily.
Let S denote the set of plagiarism cases in the corpus, and let R denote the set of
detections reported by a plagiarism detector for the suspicious documents. To simplify
the notation, a plagiarism case s = 〈splg, dplg, ssrc, dsrc〉, s ∈ S, is represented as a set
s of references to the characters of dplg and dsrc, forming the passages splg and ssrc.
Likewise, a plagiarism detection r ∈ R is represented as r. Based on this notation,
precision and recall of R under S can be measured as follows [13]:
prec(S,R) =
1
|R|
∑
r∈R
|
⋃
s∈S(s u r)|
|r|
, rec(S,R) =
1
|S|
∑
s∈S
|
⋃
r∈R(s u r)|
|s|
,
where s u r =
{
s ∩ r if r detects s,
∅ otherwise.
Observe that neither precision nor recall account for the fact that plagiarism detec-
tors sometimes report overlapping or multiple detections for a single plagiarism case.
This is undesirable, and to address this deficit also a detector’s granularity is quantified
as follows:
gran(S,R) =
1
|SR|
∑
s∈SR
|Rs|,
where SR ⊆ S are cases detected by detections in R, and Rs ⊆ R are detections of s.
I.e., SR = {s | s ∈ S ∧ ∃r ∈ R : r detects s} and Rs = {r | r ∈ R ∧ r detects s}.
The above measures have been computed for every plagiarism detector that took part in
PAN’11; however, they do not allow for an absolute ranking among them. Therefore,
the three measures are combined into a single overall score as follows:
plagdet(S,R) =
F1
log2(1 + gran(S,R))
,
where F1 is the equally weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall.
2 Intrinsic Plagiarism Detection
This section surveys the intrinsic plagiarism detectors and evaluates their performances.
2.1 Survey of Detection Approaches
Intrinsic plagiarism detection has attracted renewed interest in PAN’11. An analysis of
the submitted notebooks reveals a generic set of building blocks all of which employ
a chunking strategy, a writing style retrieval model, and an outlier detection algorithm;
however, the specifics differ significantly. In all cases, the mentioned building blocks
are arranged within a retrieval process similar to that described by the authors of [7,
16]: For a given suspicious document, (1) the document is chunked, (2) the chunks are
represented under the style retrieval model, and (3) style differences are identified by
means of outlier detection among the chunk representations. (4) After post-processing,
the identified chunks are returned as potentially plagiarized passages.
Chunking All of the submitted detectors employ sliding window chunking with chunk
sizes ranging from 200 to 1000 words. The slide stepping of the window ranges from
40 to 500 words. The best performing detectors use chunk sizes of 400 words [9] and
1000 words [6].
Retrieval Model Retrieval models for intrinsic plagiarism detection are comprised of
a model function that maps texts onto feature representations along with a similarity
measure to compare representations. The submitted detectors use either word-based
features or character-based features: Oberreuter et al. [9] use a word vector including
stop words with tf -weighting, Akiva [1] use a binary word vector including only the
100 rarest words that appear in at least 5% of all chunks, while Kestemont et al. [6] use
the 2500 most frequent char-3-grams, and Rao et al. [14] use char-3-grams as well as
other well-known features that quantify writing style. Notice that the choice of features
determines the least sensible chunk length, since some features require a minimum
amount of text in order to provide robust results. Regarding similarity measures, all
except one detector employ measures similar to Stamatatos’ nd1 [16]. The detector of
Akiva employs cosine similarity.

Outlier Detection Based on the style retrieval model, outlier detection attempts to iden-
tify chunks of the suspicious document that are noticeably different from the rest. The
following two strategies have been applied this year: (1) measuring the deviation from
the average document style, and (2) chunk clustering. The former strategy follows the
original proposal of [7] by comparing each chunk representation with that of the whole
suspicious document [9, 14]. Rationale of this approach is to measure the extent the
style of a chunk matches the average style of the whole suspicious document. A signif-
icant deviation is interpreted as an indication of different authorship. Chunk clustering,
on the other hand, compares the chunk representations and attempts to cluster them into
groups of similar styles, whereas the chunks of each group may have been written by
a different author [1, 6]. While a lot of finesse has to be applied in order to achieve
reasonable performance in outlier detection, it is important to keep in mind that these
algorithms also depend crucially on the choice of retrieval model.
Post-processing With regard to post-processing most detectors merge overlapping and
consecutive chunks that have been identified as outliers in order to decrease detection
granularity.
2.2 Evaluation
Table 2 shows the detection performances of the aforementioned detectors accord-
ing to the detection performance measures plagdet, precision, recall, and granularity.
The overall best performing detector stems from Oberreuter et al. [9]; it outperforms
all other detectors on all except one performance measure. The detector of Keste-
mont et al. [6], however, performs best with regard to recall. Interestingly, both detec-
tors achieve their performances based on different outlier detection strategies, namely
chunk-document comparison and chunk-chunk comparison. Under the latter it appears
to be more difficult to achieve a good tradeoff between precision and recall. The detector
of Stamatatos [16] serves as a baseline for comparison. It has been the best performing
intrinsic plagiarism detector of PAN’09, and it still outperforms all except one of the
submitted detectors: the detector of Oberreuter et al. performs more than 40% better.
While the baseline detector performs better on medium and long plagiarism cases,
the submitted detectors perform better on short and medium length cases. Automatically
translated plagiarism is detected better than manually corrected translation plagiarism.
Regarding the ratio of plagiarism per document, the picture is not clear, with the first
detector performing similar on documents with a hardly and medium ratio of plagia-
rized text, the second performing better on the latter, and the third performing better on
the former. Finally, with regard to document length, a medium length seems to be best
for intrinsic plagiarism detection.
2.3 Discussion
The outstanding performance of the detector of Oberreuter et al. [9] looks very encour-
aging, but it should be taken with a grain of salt. The detector’s retrieval model quanti-
fies the uniqueness of a word with regard to the whole suspicious document. However,
during construction of the PAN-PC-11, plagiarism cases have been inserted into the
suspicious documents from randomly chosen source documents, so that no topic over-
lap between a suspicious document and its sources can be expected. I.e., with a high
probability, words have been inserted into the suspicious documents that did not occur
beforehand. A retrieval model which builds on computing word uniqueness hence ben-
efits from this construction principle. Moreover, it is surprising that a retrieval model
which builds on words instead of writing style features which have been shown in the
past to outperform word-based style quantification should perform that well on intrin-
sic plagiarism detection. Presumably, the PAN’11 performance may not be achieved in
different settings.
These results are nonetheless important as they pinpoint a problem with construct-
ing a corpus for intrinsic plagiarism detection. Randomly inserting text into a document
may preserve writing style, but it obviously doesn’t represent plagiarist behavior, and
it hence opens the door to detection approaches which may not be applicable in prac-
tice. Though, at the time of writing, no better way of constructing a corpus for intrinsic
plagiarism detection evaluation is at hand, this will be an important subject for future
research. Also, the second best performing detector of Kestemont et al. [6] points into
new directions to improve detection performance in terms of recall.
3 External Plagiarism Detection
This section surveys the external plagiarism detectors and evaluates their performances.
3.1 Survey of Detection Approaches
External plagiarism detection continues to be an important part of the PAN plagiarism
detection competition. Several of the plagiarism detectors that have been evaluated this
year are enhanced versions of detectors that have been evaluated in previous years. An
analysis of the submitted notebooks reveals that the generic retrieval process for ex-
ternal plagiarism detection described at length in the overview papers of PAN’09 and
PAN’10 did not change much [11, 12]: For a given suspicious document and a collection
of potential source documents, (1) all documents are pre-processed using an indexing
pipeline that normalizes the word tokens by removing stop words, stems the remain-
der, and replaces words with one of their synonyms. Moreover, non-English documents
are typically translated to English using Google Translate or other translation services.
(2) A set of candidate source documents is retrieved from the collection of source doc-
uments, (3) each candidate document is compared in detail to the suspicious document
in order to extract similar passages of text, and finally, (4) the extracted passages are
post-processed to filter false positive detections, while the remainder is returned to the
user as potential plagiarism detections.
While the specifics of the algorithms applied in each of the aforementioned steps
have not changed much, it can be observed that some participants focus on certain
aspects such as runtime performance, cross-language detection, and obfuscation. The
detector of Cooke et al. [2], for example, is reportedly capable of processing the entire
PAN-PC-11 in about 12 minutes—whereas all other detectors require at least a couple
of hours. Moreover, the detector of Rodríguez Torrejón and Ramos [15] implements
a custom-made translation dictionary for cross-language plagiarism detection. The top
three plagiarism detectors of Grman and Ravas [4], Grozea and Popescu [5], and Ober-
reuter et al. [9], however, follow the best practices that emerged in the previous editions
of PAN.
3.2 Evaluation
Table 3 shows the detection performances of the detectors that took part in PAN’10;
the table reports the detection performance measures plagdet, precision, recall, and
granularity. The best-performing detector of Grman and Ravas [4] dominates all other
detectors on all measures and on almost all variations of the corpus parameters. The
second and third best-performing detector of Grozea and Popescu [5] and Oberreuter
et al. [9] achieve 33% and 60% less plagdet performance respectively.

The precision performance of the top five detectors is very high, while the recall
performances varies from poor to medium, depending on the corpus parameter. In fact,
only verbatim plagiarism is detected with high recall. The granularity of the top five
detectors is close to 1.0 in most cases, while the remaining detectors show compara-
bly unstable performance characteristics. With regard to the corpus parameters it can
be seen that manual obfuscation in terms of paraphrasing and translation is much more
difficult to be detected than automatic obfuscation. While the length of a case has a
certain influence on detection performance (short cases are less well detected), the doc-
ument length as well as the ratio of plagiarism per document have no effect on detection
performance.
Compared to the performances reported in PAN’09 and PAN’10, a drop in the
plagdet performance can be observed in PAN’11. This fact does not indicate a worse
detection performance compared to previous years, but should be attributed to an in-
creased detection difficulty: during the construction of the PAN-PC-11 corpus we have
lowered the ratio of plagiarism cases that are not obfuscated, while we have increased
the number of cases that are manually or automatically obfuscated. Within the previous
as well as this competition, it became clear that verbatim plagiarism poses no challenge
to detection anymore, so that the high absolute performance values reported may lead
to the false conclusion that plagiarism detection in general is close to being solved. By
changing the respective corpus parameters, we address this issue; however it forecloses
a direct comparison between performances of this year and those of earlier years.
3.3 Discussion
The external plagiarism detection sub-task of the PAN’11 competition on plagiarism
detection has matured in the past three years: in the first year the size of the test cor-
pus posed the biggest difficulty, in the second year the revised corpus introduced new
challenges such as manual obfuscation, whereas in the third year the difficulty of the
task was increased. Furthermore, many of the plagiarism detectors have been evalu-
ated more than once. Unfortunately, however, some participants chose not to share their
approaches, so that some of the achieved performances cannot be replicated or verified.
4 Conclusion
The results of the 3rd international competition on plagiarism detection, PAN’11, can
be summarized as follows: 11 plagiarism detectors have been developed from which
7 detectors tackle external plagiarism detection, 2 detectors tackle intrinsic plagiarism
detection, and 2 detectors handle both. Five of the detectors have been evaluated the
second time, and one for the third time. One of the new detectors dominates all other
detectors in terms of detection performance on the third revised version of the PAN
plagiarism corpus PAN-PC-11. The corpus features plagiarism cases with an increased
level of detection difficulty compared to previous corpus versions.
The lessons learned from the competition include that the portion of our corpus
which is dedicated to intrinsic plagiarism detection may be biased: the evaluation may
not favor realistic detection approaches over less realistic ones. Moreover, the increased
detection difficulty draws a clearer picture of the detection performances of today’s
plagiarism detectors.
