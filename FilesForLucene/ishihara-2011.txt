Abstract. This is a linguistic study on idiosyncrasy manifested 
through language use in Japanese monologues. For this purpose, 
we use speaker classification techniques as analytical tools. 
Focusing on Japanese particles, the subcategories of these 
particles, and interjections, we aim to find out to what extent 
Japanese speakers are idiosyncratic in selecting certain words 
above others in monologues. We are interested in how 
differently or similarly the individualising information of 
speakers is manifested between the subcategories of these 
particles, and also between particles and interjections. The genres 
of the monologues in this study vary from conference 
presentations on various topics covering humanities, social 
sciences, natural sciences and engineering to mock public 
speeches on a variety of general topics, such as “most pleasant 
memory,” “about your community,” etc. We demonstrate in this 
study that Japanese particles and interjections carry different 
degrees of individualising information. We also discuss what 
contributes to the identified differences between them.

1. Introduction1 
We intuitively know that different people talk and write differently, even when 
they try to convey the same message. We also know that people tend to use their 
individually selected preferred words despite the fact that, in principle, they can 
use any word at any time from the vocabulary built up over the course of their 
lives—given that their word choice falls within the constraints arising from their 
topic, the register, the audience, etc. Every speaker of a given language has their 
own distinctive and individual version of language, which is often referred to as 
their idiolect (Halliday et al. 1964, Coulthard & Johnson 2007). This idiolect 
manifests itself in various aspects of communication, such as the choice of words 
and expressions, grammar, morphology, semantics and discourse structure. The 
focus of the current study is idiosyncratic word choice, by means of particle and 
interjection usage in spoken Japanese monologues. 
In the domain of written language, in contrast to spoken language, linguistic 
idiosyncrasy has been mainly studied as authorship attribution. A large number of 
studies have been conducted on this topic (Burrows 1987, Baayen et al. 1996, 
Fung 2003). Authorship attribution concerns the task of identifying the author of 
a text. Studies in authorship attribution first emerged as stylometric studies2, with 
many of the pioneering studies based on literary texts (Mendenhall 1887, Thisted 
& Efron 1987, Mosteller & Wallace 1984, Holmes 1992).  
Various techniques have been proposed to model authorship attribution, such as 
those based on syntactic or grammatical features (Baayen et al. 1996, Stamatatos et 
al. 2001) and on probabilistic language models (Keselj et al. 2003, Peng et al. 2003). 
Many of them are based on the unique lexical usage of authors (Holmes et al. 
2001, Juola & Baayen 2005), assuming that the selection of words is unique to 
each author and that their preferred selection is consistent over time (Mendenhall 
1887, Holmes 1992). Indeed, it has been demonstrated that word category usage 
is very stable across time and writing topics (Pennebaker & King 1999).

In particular, function words are often used as an individualising feature to 
quantify the unique lexical usage of individual authors, which has been attested in 
many previous studies (Burrows 1987, Holmes 1992, Holmes et al. 2001, Binongo 
2003, García & Martín 2007). Function words are closed class words, therefore 
having little contextual meaning. As such, the selection of function words is 
considered to be less influenced by the content of a text than by that of lexical 
words. Mosteller & Wallace (1964) were the first to demonstrate the effectiveness 
of frequently occurring function words (e.g. the, if, to) in addressing the issues of 
the so-called Federalist Papers. Burrows (1987) also successfully used 30-50 
function words for his authorship analysis work. Previous studies have inferred 
that the use of function words has large variation between authors, but little 
variation within a single author, which is ideal for authorship classification 
(Baayen et al. 1996, Burrows 1987, Mosteller & Wallace 1964).  
In contrast to written language, studies on the idiosyncratic choice of words in 
spoken language are relatively few. However, the concept of idiolect in the 
selection of function words has been incorporated into automatic speaker 
recognition systems in order to enhance their performance (Doddington 2001, 
Weber et al. 2002). In addition to function words, fillers (such as English um, you 
know, like), which are unique to spoken language, have also been reported to carry 
idiosyncratic speaker information. Weber et al. (2002) reported that the inclusion 
of fillers, as well as functions words, as a speaker individualising feature in 
automatic speaker recognition systems improves their performance. In Japanese, 
Ishihara (2010) and Ishihara & Kinoshita (2010) demonstrated that Japanese 
fillers bear speaker idiosyncratic information to the extent that the accuracy of 
speaker classification based solely on fillers can be as high as 85% for male 
speakers. For these studies, speech samples collected from Japanese monologues 
across various genres were used.  
Previous studies on idiosyncratic word choice have centred on English as the 
target language, and, as mentioned earlier, have mainly concerned the written 
domain. Thus, in the current study, we look into the idiosyncratic selection of 
particles and interjections in spoken Japanese, as found in spoken monologues. 
More precisely, the current study investigates:

• To what extent Japanese speakers are idiosyncratic in selecting certain 
particles or interjections over others; 
• How many particles and interjections need to be included for the most 
accurate speaker classification results; 
• Whether there are any differences between particles and interjections in 
the degree of idiosyncrasy; and,  
• Whether there are any differences between the subcategories of particles in 
the characteristics of individual differences. 
In this study, we focus on particles and interjections. Particles are function words, 
while interjections are content words. As such, there are distinctive differences in 
the type of information they provide, as is explained in §2. As a result of these 
differences, the idiosyncratic information that they carry about speakers may also 
be different. 
In order to answer the aforementioned research questions, we conducted a series 
of speaker classification tests based solely on particles or interjections. The 
hypothesis is that the more consistent the individual speaker’s selection and use of 
these words is, and the more strongly the selection and use by one speaker differs 
from that of another, the more accurate the speaker classifications. We would like 
to emphasise here that the purpose of the current study is not to improve the 
accuracy of the speaker classification system, but to investigate the nature of 
idiosyncrasy in word selections, and to what extent and how the idiosyncrasy of 
speakers is manifested in word selection for the case of particular particles and 
interjections. 
The current study aims to contribute not only to a better understanding of 
speaker idiosyncrasy in language use, but also to the advancement of language and 
speech technologies such as automatic speaker recognition systems (Doddington 
2001), plagiarism detection systems (Woolls 2003), and automatic authorship 
identification systems (Burrows 1987, Baayen et al. 1996, Fung 2003). The current 
study is also relevant to the forensic investigation of linguistic data (Ishihara 2010, 
Ishihara & Kinoshita 2010).

2. Particles and interjections in Japanese 
In this section, the linguistic nature and functions of particles (jyoshi) and 
interjections (kantanshi) in Japanese is explained.  
There are many different ways of classifying Japanese particles, jyoshi, into 
subcategories, with Japanese linguists forever arguing about what words need to 
be considered as particles. As a consequence, in Japanese, the term ‘particle’ is 
used in a variety of contexts, though generally referring to small, uninflected 
grammatical words that follow items such as nouns, verbs, adjectives or sentences 
(Backhouse 1993). In the database we use for this study (cf. §3.1), particles are 
classified into the subcategories of case particles (kaku-jyoshi), focus particles 
(kakari-jyoshi), adverbial particles (fuku-jyoshi), conjunctive particles (setsuzoku-jyoshi), 
final particles (shu-jyoshi) and nominal particles (jyuntai-jyoshi). However, in the 
current study, we combine case and focus particles as case-focus particles because 
only one item (-wa) is subcategorised as a focus particle in the database, and the 
location in which the focus particle (-wa) appears is the same as that of case 
particles. We do not consider nominal particles, often called nominalisers, in this 
study because there is only one item (-no) classified in this subcategory and there is 
no other category into which nominal particles can be sensibly included. Thus, as 
shown in Table 1, we investigate case-focus, adverbial, conjunctive and final 
particles.

study. 
 
According to Ameka (1992:101), interjections are well recognised by people, but 
are a neglected part of speech in theoretical linguistics. Ameka (1992:113-114) 
classifies interjections into three categories: expressive, conative and phatic 
interjections. Expressive interjections are vocal gestures that indicate the speaker’s 
mental state, for example, Yuk! ‘I feel disgust’ and Aha! ‘I now know this’. 
Conative interjections are those expressions that are uttered at an auditor, such as 
 
Proceedings of the 42nd ALS Conference – 2011                                                                   ISHIHARA

Sh! ‘I want silence here’. Phatic interjections are those expressions that are used to 
establish and maintain communicative contact, including backchanneling and 
fillers. 
In the following subsections, we provide more detailed information about the 
target subcategories of particles and interjections. 
2.1 Case particles 
Case particles (kaku-jyoshi) provide the grammatical relationship between the 
predicate of a sentence and the noun phrases appearing in the sentence. In (1), the 
case particles, -ga, -de and -o indicate that the immediately preceding noun phrases 
serve as the subject, instrument and direct object of the predicate of the sentence, 
respectively. 
(1) ani                -ga          boo   -de                  watashi -o                  tataita 
elder.brother-SUBJECT stick-INSTRUMENT I          -DIRECT.OBJECT hit.PAST 
‘My elder brother hit me with a stick.’ 
2.2 Focus particles 
Focus particles focus on, or emphasise, the noun to which they are attached. In 
(2), the noun that is followed by the focus particle -wa serves as the topic of this 
sentence. Note that the location in which the focus particle appears is the same as 
that of case particles, though the function is significantly different. Another 
difference between the focus particle, -wa and case particles, is that -wa follows 
some of the case particles. 
(2) watashi-wa        sore-o                          tabenakatta 
I         -FOCUS    it   -DIRECT.OBJECT eat.NEGATIVE.PAST 
‘As for me, I did not eat it.’ 
As explained earlier, case and focus particles in this study are treated as one group 
of case-focus particles. 
2.3 Conjunctive particles 
As the name indicates, conjunctive particles are used to join clauses in a variety of 
contexts. In sentences (3) and (4), the two verbs are joined with the conjunctive

~ 158 ~ 
 
particles -kedo and -nagara, which provide the meanings of but and while in English, 
respectively. 
(3) ringo  -o                        katta       -kedo tabenakatta 
 apple-DIRECT.OBJECT buy.PAST-but   eat.NEGATIVE.PAST  
 ‘I bought an apple, but I did not eat it.’ 
(4)  ringo   -o                       aruki -nagara tabeta 
 apple-DIRECT.OBJECT walk  -while   eat.PAST 
 ‘I ate an apple while walking.’ 
2.4 Adverbial particles 
Adverbial particles are attached to clauses, and modify the predicate of a sentence, 
as can be seen in (5). They are adverbial in behaviour (Matsumura 1969). As 
illustrated in (6), some adverbial particles can be attached to nouns (also adjectives 
and adverbs) (Kaiser et al. 2001). 
(5)  watashi-wa      ringo   -o                       tabeta      -dake -da 
I        -TOPIC apple-DIRECT.OBJECT eat.PAST -only  -COPULA 
 ‘I ate only an apple.’ 
(6) watashi -dake ringo  -o                        tabeta 
I          -only apple-DIRECT.OBJECT eat.PAST 
‘Only I ate an apple.’ 
2.5 Final particles 
Final particles appear in sentence-final position. These particles show in various 
ways how the speaker appeals to the listener, and with what sort of interactional 
attitude (Kaiser et al. 2001). The example sentences given in (7), (8) and (9) are of 
the same construction, except for the final particles -ka, -yo and -ne, respectively. 
The final particle -ka is a question particle. The final particle -yo is used to indicate 
that the sentence expresses what the speaker knows or believes, while the final 
particle -ne is used to indicate that the sentence expresses what the speaker 
believes that the hearer knows or believes (Katagiri 2007:1315). However, as 
Katagiri (2007) argues, amongst other things, intonation plays an important role in 
the interpretation of the meaning of the final particle (Davis 2011, Venditti 1995).

(7) kaigi      -wa        rokuji     -kara   desu      -ka 
meeting-TOPIC 6.oclock-from COPULA-KA 
‘Is the meeting from 6 o’clock?’ 
(8) kaigi      -wa      rokuji     -kara   desu        -yo 
meeting-TOPIC 6.oclock-from COPULA-YO 
‘The meeting is from 6 o’clock (I believe).’ 
(9)  kaigi      -wa      rokuji     -kara   desu       -ne 
meeting-TOPIC 6.oclock-from COPULA-NE 
‘The meeting is from 6 o’clock, isn’t it (I believe that you believe so).’ 
There are well-reported gender differences in the use of final particles (Martin 
2004, Kinsui 2007). For example, -ze and -zo are fairly crude expressions, and thus 
are exclusively used by (young) males while -wa tends to be used by females to 
express femininity (Martin 2004, Matsumura 1969). 
2.6 Interjections 
According to Martin (2004:1041), interjections function to A) express the 
speaker’s emotional reactions, such as pleasure, relief, surprise, hesitation, or 
disgust; B) call attention; C) respond to a question, a command, or a social 
transaction; and D) hold the floor when fluency fails and the speaker is searching 
for a desired expression (e.g. fillers). 
Since the target utterances in the current study are monologues, the majority of 
tokens categorised as interjections are in fact fillers, which belong to group D. 
However, there are some occurrences that belong to A, such as ara ‘oh’, ee ‘eh’ 
and yoisho ‘oof’ and to C, such as hai ‘yes’ and un ‘yep’.  
2.7 Differences between particles and interjections, and also 
between the subcategories of particles 
As explained in §2.1 to §2.5, particles are non-conjugated function words. They 
follow items such as nouns, verbs, adjectives or sentences, and they prosodically 
merge into the preceding material (Backhouse 1993). On the other hand, 
interjections can be used by themselves as independent free-standing units, 
grammatically like sentences (Tokieda 1950). Like the four functions of 
 
Proceedings of the 42nd ALS Conference – 2011                                                                   ISHIHARA

interjections summarised in §2.6, interjections are more related to higher level 
information (e.g. para-/extra-linguistic information, such as emotions) than 
particles, which mainly serve to carry linguistic information such as syntactic 
relationships and minor modifications of meaning. It is interesting to see if there 
is any difference in the manifestation of speaker idiosyncrasies between particles 
and interjections. Furthermore, the nature and function of the subcategories of 
particles are also very different. For example, final particles provide the speaker’s 
attitude towards the listener, which is beyond simple syntactic information. Thus, 
it is also of interest how the idiosyncratic information of speakers is carried by the 
different categories of particles. 
 
3. Methodology 
This is a linguistic study on idiosyncrasy using speaker classification techniques as 
analytical tools. The more consistent the individual speaker’s selection of certain 
words is, and the more significantly those words selected by the speaker vary 
from those selected by another, the more accurately the speaker classification is 
performed.  
Two kinds of comparisons are involved in speaker classification tests. The first is 
called Same Speaker Comparison (SS comparison) in which two speech samples 
produced by the same speaker need to be correctly identified as the same speaker. 
The other is, mutatis mutandis, Different Speaker Comparison (DS comparison). 
The series of speaker classification tests that we conducted can be categorised into 
two experiments: Experiment 1 investigates how well we can classify speakers 
based on each of the different subcategories of the particles (cf. §5.1). Experiment 
2 investigates the overall performance of all particles and interjections in speaker 
classification (cf. §5.2). Although the target words for Experiments 1 and 2 are 
different, the experimental methodology is identical for both of them.  
3.1 Database and speakers 
For speech data, we used the Corpus of Spontaneous Japanese (CSJ) (Maekawa et 
al. 2000), which contains recordings of various speaking styles such as sentence 
 
Proceedings of the 42nd ALS Conference – 2011                                                                   ISHIHARA

reading, monologue, and conversation. For this study, we used only the 
monologues, categorised as either Academic Presentation Speech (APS) or 
Simulated Public Speech (SPS). APS was mainly live-recorded academic 
presentations, between 12-25 minutes long. For SPS, 10-12 minute mock 
speeches on everyday topics were recorded. We selected our speakers from this 
corpus based on three criteria: availability of multiple and non-contemporaneous 
recordings, spontaneity (e.g. not reading) of the speech, and standard modern 
Japanese speech. The spontaneity of the language and the extent to which it 
conforms to standard modern Japanese were assessed on the basis of the rating 
the CSJ provided. Thus, only those speech samples which were high in 
spontaneity and uttered entirely in Standard Japanese were selected for this study. 
This gave us 416 speech samples for inclusion (= 208 speakers: 132 male and 76 
female speakers x 2 sessions). 
3.2 Basic statistics 
Table 2 provides the basic statistics of the target particles and interjections. In this 
study, we decided to use those particle types that appeared three times or more in 
the selected speech samples for the speaker classification experiments. As seen in  
Table 2, 50% of all particle types belong to case-focus particles. Final particle 
types account for only 10% of all particle types.

order, separately for the subcategories and all together for all particle types.

Table 3 is also referred to when we discuss the results of the speaker classification 
experiments in §5.  
Mirroring the fact that case-focus particle types account for 50% of all particle 
types, the occurrences of the ten most frequently used case-focus particles are 
significantly greater than those of the other particles. Consequently, eight of the 
ten most frequently used particles are case-focus particles, as can be seen in the 
rightmost column of Table 3. Note that the -no particle presents as the most 
frequently used particle. This is the case despite the fact that the genitive particle 
as the nominaliser particle -no is excluded in this study. 
The different types of interjections listed in Table 4 are all fillers.

3.3 Vector space model 
In this study, we compare many sets of paired speech samples. Using the 
occurrences of the identified words, each speech sample is modelled as a real-
valued vector3. If n different words are used to represent a given speech sample S, 
the dimensionality of the vector is n. That is, S is represented as a vector of n 
dimensions (= (F1, F2 . . . Fn), in which Fn represents the nth component of  
and Fn is the frequency of the nth word). For example, if 5 words (e.g. ah, like, 
OK, yes, all right) are used to represent a speech sample (x), and the frequency 
counts of these words in the speech sample are 3, 10, 4, 18 and 1, respectively, the 
speech sample x is represented as given in (1). 
(1)  = 3,10,4,18,1 
The speech samples in this study are modelled using different vector dimensions 
(e.g. using the first 20 most frequently used fillers). This is to see how the 
performance of the speaker classification system is influenced by the number of 
dimensions.  
3.4 Term frequency-inverse document frequency weighting 
The usefulness of particular words for the purposes of speaker classification is 
determined by their uniqueness. This is based on the number of different speech 
samples in which they occur, as well as how frequently they are used in a 
particular speech sample. For instance, if a given word is used by many speakers 
many times, this particular word is not as useful as a word which is used by a 
smaller number of people in many instances. Different weights are therefore 
given to different words depending on their uniqueness in the pooled data. The 
tf·idf (term frequency-inverse document frequency) weight (cf. Formula (2)) is 
used to evaluate how unique a given word is in the population. A corresponding 
weight is given to that word to reflect its importance in speaker classification 
(Manning & Schütze 2000).

 Readers with little background in mathematics and statistics are advised to read chapter five of 
(Manning & Schütze 2000), in which they explain the statistics that are available and how they can be 
used for the analysis of word usages.

In Formula (2), term frequency (tfi,j) is the number of occurrences of word i (wi) 
in the document (or speech sample) j (dj). Document frequency (dfi) is the 
number of documents (or speech samples) in the collection in which that word i 
(wi) occurs. N is the total number of documents (or speech samples). 
3.5 Cosine similarity measure 
The similarity between two speech samples, which are represented as vectors (,
), is calculated based on the cosine similarity measure. This is indicated in (3) 
(Manning & Schütze 2000). This particular method was selected in order to 
normalise the different durations of the speech samples. The cosine similarity 
measure is based on the assumption that the direction of a vector should be 
constant if the speech sample is long enough.

The range of difference between the two vectors (similarity,) is between 1.0 
(=cos(0°)) for two vectors pointing in the same direction—e.g. speech samples 
which are identical—and 0.0 (=cos(90°)) for two orthogonal vectors—two speech 
samples which are completely different, because weights are by their definition 
not negative4. Note that in the experiments of this study, the length (number of 
dimensions) of the vectors was standardised by only looking at the X most 
frequent particles and interjections (X = (5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40 … N); N = 
the maximum number of dimensions), since the cosine similarity measure requires 
vectors of equal length (number of dimensions).

 Note that the range of cosine similarity measure, which is between 0 for two orthogonal vectors and 
between 1 for two vectors pointing in the same direction, is counter-intuitive. Readers need to be 
reminded that 0 stands for two speech samples being completely different and 1 for those being 
identical.

4. Method for speaker classification 
The performance of speaker classification is assessed on the basis of the 
probability distribution functions (PDFs) of the difference between two 
contrastive hypotheses. One is the hypothesis that two speech samples were 
uttered by the same speaker (the same speaker (SS) hypothesis) and the other is 
that two speech samples were uttered by different speakers (the different speaker 
(DS) hypothesis). These probabilities can be formulated as P(E|Hss) and P(E|Hds) 
respectively, where E is the difference, Hss is the SS hypothesis and Hds is the DS 
hypothesis. In this study, the PDF of the difference assuming the SS hypothesis is 
true is called the SS PDF (PDFss), and the PDF assuming the DS hypothesis is 
true is the DS PDF (PDFds). Specific to this study, the difference between two 
speech samples refers to the cosine difference between the two vectors 
representing the two speech samples. Each PDF was modelled using the kernel 
density function (KernSmooth library of R statistical package). Examples of PDFss 
and PDFds are given in Figure 1. In Figure 1, the PDFss and PDFds do not conform 
to a normal distribution, which is the motivation for the use of the kernel density 
function in this study.

the crossing point between PDFss and 
PDFds. Area 1 is the area surrounded 
by the red curve (PDFss), d = 0 and c =

black curve (PDFds), d = 0 and c = ɵ.

As can be seen from Figure 1, PDFss and PDFds are not always monotonic. This 
may result in more than one crossing point (which is not shown in Figure 1, 
particularly when the dimension of a vector is less than 5. Thus, the performance 
of the system with the dimension of a vector less than 5 is not given. These two 
PDFs also show the accuracy of this particular speaker classification system. If the 
crossing point (ɵ) of the PDFss and the PDFds is set as the threshold, we can 
estimate the performance of this particular speaker classification system from 
these PDFs. Area 1 in Figure 1—the area surrounded by the red line (PDFss), the 
vertical dotted line of c = ɵ and the line of d = 0—is the predicted error for the SS 
comparisons. Area 2 of Figure 1—the area which is surrounded by the black line 
(PDFds), the vertical dotted line of c = ɵ and the line of d = 0—is the predicted 
error for the DS comparisons. Therefore, the accuracy (%) of the SS 
(ACCURACYss) and DS (ACCURACYds) comparisons can be calculated by (4) and 
(5), respectively.

The accuracy of a speaker classification system (both in SS and DS comparisons) 
was estimated in this way. 
For the selected 416 speech samples obtained from 208 speakers, 208 SS and 
86,112 DS comparisons are possible. In the speaker classification tests, spatial 
vectors of different dimensions (5, 10, 15, 20 … N, where N is the maximum 
number of dimensions) are used to see how the number of vector dimensions 
affects the performance of speaker classification. That is, for the adverbial 
particles, which include 31 different kinds, we applied the vector sizes (number of 
dimensions) of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 and 31. 
 
5. Test results and discussions 
In this section, the classification performance of the different subcategories of the 
particles is closely investigated in §5.1, followed by comparison between the

performance of all particles and that of interjections in §5.2. In §5.3, the speaker-
individualising characteristics of the particles belonging to the different 
subcategories will be scrutinised in terms of between- and within-speaker 
differences.  
5.1 Experiment 1: subcategories of particles 
The respective speaker classification performances of the different particle 
subcategories (case-focus, adverbial, conjunctive, and final particles) are presented 
first. The differences between them in terms of performance are described before 
discussing possible reasons for the identified differences.  
In Figure 2, the average speaker classification accuracy between the same speaker 
(SS) and different speaker (DS) comparisons is plotted separately for the different 
subcategories of the particles as a function of the number of vector dimensions.  
 
As can be seen from Figure 1, the speaker classification accuracy reaches as high 
as approximately 70% for case-focus, adverbial and conjunctive particles. 
Adverbial and conjunctive particles reach their highest accuracy points with a 
fewer number of dimensions (15 and 10 dimensions, respectively) than case-focus 
particles (35 dimensions). The reader is reminded that, for example, 15

particle and final particle as a function 
of the number of dimensions (x-axis) 
used in the speaker classification tests.

for each type.

dimensions indicates that the speaker classification test was conducted using the 
15 most frequently used particles in the subcategory. For case-focus particles, the 
speaker classification accuracy considerably improves from 15 dimensions 
(60.6%) to 25 dimensions (68.8%). A similar jump in accuracy can be observed 
with fewer dimensions (from 5 dimensions: 64.3% to 15 dimensions: 69.9%) for 
adverbial particles. The classification accuracy of conjunctive particles is as high as 
69.9% with as few as only 5 dimensions.  
The observation that more dimensions (or particle types) need to be included for 
case-focus particles to reach the same level of accuracy (approximately 70%) as 
adverbial and conjunctive particles is probably because the first 15-20 most 
frequently used case-focus particles are so ubiquitous. Hence, there is not much 
room for them to bear the individualising information of the speakers. This 
frequent occurrence of case-focus particles can be seen from Table 3, in which 
the occurrence of the top ten case-core particles is substantially higher than those 
of the other particles. Please also note that the curve of the case-focus particles in 
Figure 2 starts with 15 dimensions because the PDFss and the PDFds with less than 
15 dimensions become non-monotonic, having multiple crossing points between 
them5. Sensible results therefore cannot be obtained with less than 15 dimensions.  
Case particles (in particular, those which are frequently used) are the backbone of 
the syntactic structure of Japanese utterances. It would be impossible for the 
speaker to accurately convey the intended message were it not for case particles. 
Since case particles serve as the dominant carrier of information, which is directly 
connected to the propositions of the messages, it is likely that less idiosyncratic 
individual speaker information is encoded in case particle usage. Consequently, 
more case-focus particles need to be included to get the same level of accuracy as 
adverbial and conjunctive particles. 
After case-focus particles reach their highest accuracy of 69.8% with 35 
dimensions, the classification accuracy continues to marginally decrease with 
some minor ups and downs as the number of dimensions increases. However, 
this trend is not surprising. The feature vectors are based on the frequency of a 
                                              
5
 In Figure 1, for example, the PDFss and the PDFds have only one crossing point which is aligned with 
c = ɵ. However, with fewer than 15 dimensions, the PDFss and the PDFds start having two or more 
crossing points.

given particle word; we picked those with a higher frequency first to be included 
in the feature. As such, vectors in the later orders have low frequencies. This 
means that the latter part of longer vectors tends to include very similar low 
numbers across speakers, introducing noise into the assessment of between-
speaker difference and thereby making them look more similar. The same trend 
cannot be clearly observed for adverbial and conjunctive particles; this is most 
likely due to the fact that the number of dimensions of the feature vectors for 
adverbial and conjunctive particles is not as high as that of the case-focus 
particles.  
The speaker classification accuracy is notably lower for final particles in 
comparison to the other particles. This is contrary to our conjecture that the 
gender difference in the use of final particles would work in favour of speaker 
classification. Two possible reasons can be noted for the poor performance of 
final particles. One is due to the speech style of the monologue samples 
(conference presentation and mock speech), both of which are fairly formal. 
Gender and speaker differences in the use of final particles may be more salient in 
informal colloquial speech, as many final particles are related to interaction rather 
than monologue-style speech. Another reason may be due to the fact that the 
length of the feature vector is far shorter (only 13) for final particles than for the 
other particles. 
5.2 Experiment 2: particles and interjections 
The following section compares the classification performance with all particles 
together versus that of interjections. In Figure 3, the average speaker classification 
accuracy between the same speaker (SS) and different speaker (DS) comparisons 
is plotted as a function of the number of vector dimensions. These functions are 
shown separately for all of the particles and interjections. Figure 3 (next page) also 
includes the results presented in Figure 2. 
There is a notable sudden improvement in accuracy in both all particles and 
interjections: a substantial improvement can be observed between 15 dimensions 
(74.8%) and 25 dimensions (79.4%) for all particles, and between 5 dimensions 
(75.6%) and 15 dimensions (81.5%) for interjections. As for the highest accuracy, 
it is 80.5% for all particles with 45 dimensions, while it is 82.7% for interjections 
 
Proceedings of the 42nd ALS Conference – 2011                                                                   ISHIHARA 
 
~ 170 ~ 
 
with 25 dimensions. The observation that all particles need more dimensions than 
interjections to reach the highest accuracy point can be attributed to the fact that, 
as can be seen from Table 2, the earlier order vectors of all particles contain many 
of the frequently occurring case-focus particles. It was previously discussed in 
§5.1 that these case-focus particles do not have much individualising information.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It is evident from Figure 3 that the performance of speaker classification is 
consistently better for interjections than for all particles, indicating that 
interjections carry more individually identifying information than particles do. As 
explained earlier, an interjection is a word used to express an emotion or a 
sentiment on the part of the speaker. Communication has been traditionally 
viewed as an intentional act of transferring information. However, independent of 
the mode of communication (spoken or written), paralinguistic or extralinguistic 
information is also conveyed along with the symbolic content of the intended 
message. Paralinguistic information is information about the speaker or writer, 
such as their age, gender, social background, psychological state, or health. This 
latter sort of information is often called paralinguistic or extralinguistic 
information (Abercrombie 1967, Nolan 1983, Rose 2002). 
A large portion of the words classified as interjections in the database are fillers. It 
has been argued based on empirical data that fillers manifest the cognitive process

between the SS and DS comparisons is 
plotted separately for all particles and 
interjections as a function of the 
number of dimensions (x-axis) used in

accuracy. The results presented in 
Figure 2 are also included as a 
reference (bottom half).

that the speaker is undergoing (Sadanobu & Takubo 1995), and also reflect the 
speaker’s difficulty in conceptual planning and linguistic encoding (Watanabe et al. 
2008). The cognitive process is a well-known source of individual differences 
(Cooper 2002). Fillers therefore transfer more than linguistic information encoded 
in written messages; fillers do not appear in written texts. On the other hand, 
particles (except for final particles) are directly involved in transmitting linguistic 
information such as the syntactic relationship between a noun phrase of a 
sentence and the predicate of the sentence, or the logical relationship between 
two clauses. These usages of case particles show that they are more directly 
relevant for transferring the content information encoded in messages as 
accurately as possible than interjections are.  
Despite the fact that each subcategory of particles has only approximately 66.5-
71.0% accuracy (cf. §5.1), the speaker classification result drastically improves by 
approximately 10% when all particles are included in the tests. This indicates that 
the individualising information of the speakers is encoded differently in the uses 
of the different subcategories of particles. If the individual characteristics of the 
speakers had been encoded in the different subcategories of particles in the same 
manner, the inclusion of all particles would not have had any effect on the 
performance of the speaker classification. This point is explored in §5.3 in terms 
of the degree of between- and within-speaker differences. 
5.3 Differences between particle subcategories 
It was pointed out that individualising information of speakers is manifested 
differently in the uses of different subcategories of particles. That is, the different 
subcategories of particles carry different aspects of individual speaker 
idiosyncrasies. In this subsection, we investigate how differently different types of 
particles possess speaker individualising information. 
The performance of speaker classification is mainly determined by two factors: 1) 
the degree of between-speaker differences, and 2) that of within-speaker 
differences. We explained earlier that the more consistent the individual speaker’s 
selection of words is, and the more significantly the selected words of one speaker 
differ from those selected by another, the more accurately the speaker 
classification can be performed. In other words, the greater the between-speaker 
 
Proceedings of the 42nd ALS Conference – 2011                                                                   ISHIHARA 
 
~ 172 ~ 
 
differences are, and concurrently, the smaller the within-speaker differences are in 
terms of the selection of words, the more accurately speakers can be classified.  
Having said that, with the degree of within-speaker differences being constant, the 
performance of speaker classification will improve as the degree of between-
speaker differences becomes greater. Equally, with the degree of between-speaker 
differences being constant, the performance will also improve as the degree of 
within-speaker differences becomes smaller. Although the speaker classification 
accuracy appears to be comparable between the case-focus, adverbial and 
conjunctive particles, the results presented in §5.2 show that their configurations 
in terms of the degree of between- and within-speaker differences are distinct 
from one another. 
The degree of between-speaker differences and that of within-speaker differences 
are manifested as the shape of the PDFds and PDFss, respectively. How they are 
derived is explained using Figure 4, a modified version of Figure 1.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The PDFds becomes more skewed towards the cosine similarity measure c = 0 as 
the degree of between-speaker differences increases (i.e. the particles used by 
different speakers are more different), but towards c = 1 as the degree of between-
speaker differences decreases (i.e. the particles used by different people are more

similar). Likewise, the PDFss becomes more skewed towards c = 0 as the degree of 
within-speaker differences increases (i.e. the particles used by the same speaker 
vary more), but towards c = 1 as the degree of within-speaker differences 
decreases (i.e. the particles used by the same speaker are more consistent). In 
order to quantify the shape of the PDFs, two measurements were taken: one is 
the mean value of the cosine similarity values which constitute each of the PDFds 
and PDFss, and the other is the skewness6 of the PDFds and PDFss. These two 
measurements were made for each of the different subcategories of particles: 
case-focus, adverbial, conjunctive and final particles, and also for all particles and 
interjections, as they are plotted in Figure 5 (next page). 
Figure 5 clearly demonstrates that the different subcategories of particles have 
different characteristics with respect to the degree of between- and within-speaker 
differences. The characteristics that can be viewed from the two panels (mean and 
skew) of Figure 5 are essentially the same. Thus, the differences between the 
different subcategories of particles are described by reference to the mean values 
(the top panel of Figure 5).  
As can be seen in Figure 5, case-focus particles (3) have greater between- and 
within-speaker differences, with their mean values located closer to cosine 
similarity measure c = 0 than the other subcategories of particles. Final particles 
(4), however, exhibit less between- and within-speaker differences, with their 
mean values located closer to c = 1. That is, in comparison to the other 
subcategories of particles, the selection of different case-focus particles is highly 
idiosyncratic across speakers, yet the selection of case-focus particles is not 
consistent within the same speaker. The behaviour of final particles is completely 
opposite to that of case-focus particles. The same speaker uses the same type(s) of 
final particles more consistently than the other subcategories of particles, while 
the selection of different types of final particles is less variable than that of the 
other types of particles across different speakers. Conjunctive particles (2) are 
similar to final particles. Adverbial particles (1) occupy an intermediate position 
compared to the other subcategories.

 Skewness was quantified by cubing the deviations from the mean, and dividing the average cubed 
distance by the cube of the standard deviation.

As for all particles (5) and interjections (6), it can be seen from Figure 5 that 
interjections perform better than all particles because the former has greater 
between-speaker differences and smaller within-speaker differences than the 
latter.  
 
6. Summary and conclusions 
We investigated the following research questions in Japanese monologues: 
• To what extent are Japanese speakers idiosyncratic in selecting certain 
particles and interjections rather than others; 
• How many particles and interjections need to be included for the best 
speaker classification results; 
• Whether there are any differences between particles and interjections in 
the degree of idiosyncrasy; and  
• Whether there are any differences between the subcategories of particles in 
the characteristics of individual differences.

It has been demonstrated that particles and interjections carry idiosyncratic 
speaker information to the extent that the average speaker classification accuracy 
of the same and different speaker comparisons is about 80.5% and 82.7%, 
respectively. We suggested that interjections carry more idiosyncratic information 
about speakers than particles do because of the different levels of information 
that they denote. Namely, particles mainly handle a linguistically lower level of 
structural information, which is directly relevant to the content of messages, 
whereas interjections assume the task of conveying paralinguistic and 
extralinguistic information. These types of information have a stronger relevance 
to the speakers’ cognitive processes and are highly diverse on an individual level. 
We also demonstrated that in comparison to interjections, particles require the 
inclusion of more dimensions in order to reach the highest accuracy point. 
We showed that the different subcategories of particles (case-focus, adverbial, 
conjunctive and final particles) exhibit distinctive characteristics in terms of the 
degree of between-speaker and within-speaker differences. Due to these 
differences, although the speaker classification performance was only 
approximately 70% accurate for each subcategory of case-focus, adverbial and 
conjunctive particles, the classification performance substantially improved when 
all particles were combined together.  
Particles and interjections account for merely a small part of our entire word 
usage. Despite this, we may say that they carry a substantial amount of speaker 
idiosyncratic information. If we are able to exploit all the word usage information 
as speaker classification features, it is likely that speaker classification can be 
performed with a high level of accuracy. This can lead to the interpretation that 
language usage is fairly individualised—even more so than we tend to think. Thus, 
linguistic studies on individual differences deserve more attention, perhaps as 
much as the more common studies which focus on the invariant aspects of 
language use.
