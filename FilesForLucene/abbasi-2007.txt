Abstract: The ability to automatically detect fraudulent escrow websites is important in order to alleviate 
online auction fraud. Despite research on related topics, fake escrow website categorization has received 
little attention. In this study we evaluated the effectiveness of various features and techniques for 
detecting fake escrow websites. Our analysis included a rich set of features extracted from web page text, 
image, and link information. We also proposed a composite kernel tailored to represent the properties of 
fake websites, including content duplication and structural attributes. Experiments were conducted to 
assess the proposed features, techniques, and kernels on a test bed encompassing nearly 90,000 web pages 
derived from 410 legitimate and fake escrow sites. The combination of an extended feature set and the 
composite kernel attained over 98% accuracy when differentiating fake sites from real ones, using the 
support vector machines algorithm. The results suggest that automated web-based information systems 
for detecting fake escrow sites could be feasible and may be utilized as authentication mechanisms. 
Keywords: Online escrow services, internet fraud, website classification, kernel-based methods 
1. Introduction 
Electronic markets have seen unprecedented growth in recent years. The lack of physical contact and 
prior interaction makes such places susceptible to opportunistic member behavior [12]. Consequently, 
fraud and deception are highly prevalent in electronic markets, particularly online auctions which account 
for 50% of internet fraud [4]. Although online escrow services (OES) are intended to serve as trusted third 
parties [6], their increased use has inevitably brought about the rise of escrow fraud. Escrow fraud is a 
variant of the popular “failure-to-ship” fraud; the seller creates a fake OES website and disappears after 
collecting the buyer’s money [4]. Fraudulent OES sites often appear authentic and difficult to identify as 
fake by unsuspecting users [8]. While there has been recent work on spoof site detection, fake OES sites 
have received little attention despite their pervasiveness. 
In this study we propose an approach designed to automatically identify fake escrow websites. The 
method incorporates a rich set of features and a classification technique based on a kernel specifically 
tailored towards representing the unique characteristics of these fake sites. The kernel enables effective 
categorization of fraudulent escrow web pages by considering content duplication patterns as well as 
website structural attributes. Results from this research serve two important purposes. Firstly, the study 
assesses the feasibility of automatic OES identification mechanisms that can help militate against the 
impact of Internet fraud stemming from fake escrow services. Secondly, evaluating different features and 
techniques for fake OES detection can provide insights into fraud patterns which may help educate 
Internet users that use trusted third party sites. 
2. Related Work 
The perceived effectiveness of OES plays a critical role in the level of online trust [12]. While OES are 
intended to offer security against the lack of identity trust, they themselves fall prey to similar concerns. It 
is often difficult for online traders to differentiate legitimate OES from fakes, making them susceptible to 
escrow fraud [4]. Automatic identification approaches could be utilized in a preemptive fashion, however 
they require considering the relevant features and techniques capable of fake OES detection. 
 While fake OES detection research has been scarce, there has been work on a related problem: web 
spam categorization. Web spam is the “injection of artificially created web pages in order to influence the 
results from search engines,” [11, p. 83]. Analogous to fake OES sites, web spam typically uses automatic 
content generation techniques to mass produce fake web pages, resulting in many discernable content 
  
  
similarities. Prior web spam research has identified cues which may be applicable to fake OES sites [4]. 
These include feature categories pertaining to the following website segments: body text, HTML design, 
URL and anchor text, images, and site linkage and structure. 
Lexical and syntactic features [2, 3] such as words per page, word n-gram frequencies, and misspellings 
are potential cues found in a web page’s body text [11]. HTML source elements such as tag n-grams are 
helpful for identifying web page design similarities [14]. URL and anchor text features including URL 
length, number of dashes and digits, and certain URL suffixes provide useful fraud cues [4, 9]. Due to 
difficulties in indexing, many studies have ignored image features [9], however even simplistic features 
can facilitate the identification of duplicate images. Linkage features, including in-links and out-links 
have been used effectively for categorizing web pages based on similar topics [9]. 
One important difference between fake escrow sites and web spam is that web spam is intended to 
deceive search engines [11] while fake escrow sites are geared towards traders. In addition to text, fake 
OES must consider website design elements in order to aesthetically appeal to online buyers. Fake OES 
site detection likely involves the inclusion of multiple feature categories; however this introduces 
representational complexities for the classification techniques employed. 
 Detection of fake OES sites entails consideration of text, images, and structure. Two techniques used 
considerably in the past are support vector machine (SVM) and principal component analysis (PCA). 
SVM’s effectiveness for categorization of style and images [10] makes it particularly suitable for fake 
OES detection. PCA has also been applied to text and image processing; using dimensionality reduction 
allows it to uncover important variation patterns [1]. A website contains many linked pages, with each 
comprised of body text, HTML, and images. Important fake OES detection characteristics include (1) the 
use of a rich feature set (2) stylistic patterns and duplication across sites (3) fraud cues inherent in website 
structure and linkage. A standard classifier can have difficulties handling such information. Two 
alternatives applicable with SVM and PCA are feature ensemble classifiers and kernel methods [10]. 
Feature ensemble classifiers are multiple classifiers built using different feature subsets. They have 
been effective for analysis of style and patterns [13]. While feature ensembles provide representational 
flexibility, feature set segmentation results in the loss of potentially informative feature interactions. 
Furthermore, a linear ensemble may still have problems considering structural information and 
accounting for content duplication tendencies. For complex structure information and problem-specific 
characteristics that cannot be described by standard feature vectors, kernel-based methods provide an 
effective alternative. Kernels can combine fraud cues inherent in text, linkage and image features along 
with website structural attributes [5]. Kolari et al. [7] noted that kernel functions could be useful for 
detecting fake websites, yet have not been explored. SVM kernels have been effective for classifying 
linked documents while Kernel PCA has been applied to image processing. 
3. Research Questions 
There is a need for fake OES detection methods given the difficulties people have in determining whether 
a particular site is legitimate [8]. However, it is unclear what features, techniques, and kernels will be 
effective. We are motivated to address the following questions: 
• How will the use of all feature categories improve performance over individual categories? 
• Which technique is better suited at differentiating fake escrow web sites from real ones? 
• Can kernel methods outperform standard linear classifiers? 
4. System Design 
Our system is comprised of features, techniques, and kernels necessary for categorization of fake OES 
websites. The feature set utilized was comprised of features from the five aforementioned categories: 
body text, HTML, URL, image, and linkage (Table 1). Body text features include lexical measures and 
style markers described in prior research [1]. HTML tag n-grams were used for representing design style 
[14]. URL features included character and token level n-grams [11]. Image features consisted of pixel 
color frequencies. Link and structure features included page and site level in/out link attributes. Since n-
gram features were selected using the information gain heuristic, their quantities were unknown apriori. 
  
  
SVM and PCA were used since both have been applied to text and image categorization. In addition to 
the linear kernel, we propose a composite kernel (Figure 1) tailored to the properties of fake OES sites. 
The kernel compares each web page to every site (based on the 5 feature categories outlined above), and 
computes the average and maximum page-page similarity for each comparison in order to detect common 
patterns as well as content duplication, respectively. Additionally, the kernel function considers structural 
attributes of the pages being compared (e.g., the number of in/out links and page levels), allowing for a 
more accurate representation of website similarity.

image, and linkage attributes are likely necessary for effective detection. We suspect that the effectiveness 
of SVM on prior web spam research [5] will also translate into enhanced identification of fake escrow 
site. We also expect the composite kernel to better represent content similarities across fake escrow 
websites, resulting in improved performance over the linear kernel. The hypotheses regarding site level 
identification of OES are:  
H1) The use of all features will outperform the use of any individual feature category. 
H2) SVM will outperform PCA. 
H3) The proposed composite kernel will outperform the linear kernel. 
6. Evaluation 
Experiments were conducted to evaluate the proposed feature set, classifiers, and kernels. This section 
encompasses a description of the experimental design, results, and hypotheses tests. We collected 350 
fake OES and 60 real escrow sites over a three month period between 12/2006 and 2/2007. The fake OES 
URLs were taken from two online databases that post the addresses for verified fraudulent escrow sites: 
Escrow Fraud Prevention (http://escrow-fraud.com) and The Artists Against 4-1-9 (http://wiki.aa419.org). 
Since fake OES sites are often shut down or abandoned after they have been used, these sites typically 
have a short life span. In order to effectively collect these websites, we developed a web spidering 
program that monitored the online databases and collected newly posted URLs daily. Table 2 below 
shows the summary statistics for our test bed. 
Table 2: Escrow Website Test Bed 
Category # of Sites # of Pages # of Images Pages Per Site Images Per Site 
Real OES Sites 60 19,812 6,653 330.20 110.88 
Fake OES Sites 350 69,684 29,764 199.10 85.04 
The experimental design included 6 feature sets (5 individual categories and all), two techniques and 
two kernels, resulting in 24 experimental conditions. We ran 50 bootstrap instances for each condition, in 
which 50 real and 50 fake escrow sites were randomly selected each run. All web pages from the selected 
100 sites were used as instances for that run and evaluated using 10-fold cross validation. PCA was run 
using the Kaiser-Guttman stopping rule which selects the n eigenvectors with an eigenvalue greater than 
1. Each test instance was assigned to the class with the lower average distance between its training points 
and the test point, across the n-dimensions [1]. The following evaluation metric was used:

Accuracy =  
Table 3 and Figure 2 show the experimental results for the various conditions. Most features performed 
well, with accuracies over 95%. Using only image features attained up to 87% accuracy, suggesting that 
image duplication is pervasive in fake OES sites. The use of all features outperformed the individual 
feature categories with the linear ensemble and composite kernel, typically improving accuracy by 2%-
10%. This supports the notion that OES fraud cues occur across feature categories. SVM outperformed 
PCA for most features except images. PCA’s dimensionality reduction was useful for discerning image 
patterns [10]. With respect to kernel representations, kernel PCA outperformed linear PCA on all feature 
sets by a wide margin. For SVM, the linear kernel had enhanced performance over the composite kernel 
on the HTML attributes while the composite kernel outperformed linear SVM on all other feature sets.

Figure 2: Performance for Various Combinations of Features, Techniques, and Kernels 
We conducted pair wise t-tests on the 50 bootstrap runs. Given the large number of test conditions, a 
Bonferroni correction was performed in order to avoid spurious positive results. Only p-values less than 
0.0004 were considered significant at alpha = 0.01. H1. Features (All vs. Individual Categories): The use 
of all features significantly outperformed individual feature sets using SVM and PCA with the linear and 
composite kernels. P-values on pair wise t-tests for all conditions were less than 0.0001 (n = 50). H2. 
Techniques (SVM vs. PCA): SVM significantly outperformed PCA for most feature sets (p-values < 
0.0001), except image attributes, with the linear and composite kernel. H3. Kernels (Linear vs. Composite 
Kernel): The composite kernel significantly outperformed the linear approaches for all feature sets (11 out 
of 12 conditions) except for SVM when using HTML. 
  
 
Figure 3: Similarities for Two Fake Pages Compared against Fraudulent OES Website www.bssew.com 
The improved performance of the composite kernel was largely attributable to its use of both average 
and max similarity. Figure 3 depicts the similarity for two pages (A and B) taken from a fake OES site 
compared against all web pages from the fraudulent site www.bssew.com. The two graphs are the site 
maps for www.bssew.com, with each web page represented with a node, and lines between nodes 
indicating linkage. Each node’s darkness indicates the level of similarity between that particular 
www.bssew.com page and pages A and B. The similarity scores are taken from the composite kernel, 
when using all features with SVM. Page A shares stylistic patterns with many pages in www.bssew.com, 
resulting in a high average similarity (evidenced by the predominance of gray page nodes). In contrast, 
Page B shares duplicated content with some pages in www.bssew.com, but little similarity with other 
pages (indicated by the presence of a few black page nodes and many lighter ones). The example 
  
  
illustrates how the composite kernel can effectively categorize unknown escrow website pages sharing 
stylistic tendencies or content duplication with other fake OES sites. 
7. Conclusions 
In this study we evaluated the effectiveness of automated approaches for fake OES website identification. 
The use of the proposed composite kernel coupled with a rich feature set and the SVM classifier was able 
to effectively identify fake OES sites with great accuracy. In addition to assessing the feasibility of 
automated detection, our analysis revealed several key findings. We observed that fake OES fraud cues 
are inherent in body text, HTML, URL, link, and image features and that the use of a rich attributes set is 
important for enhancing performance. We also found that fake OES sites share stylistic pattern and 
content duplication tendencies with other fake websites. These two properties can be successfully 
leveraged into an automated classifier by using a customized kernel function. The findings from this 
research have important implications for developers of web security information systems and Internet 
users engaging in online transactions. Knowledge of key fraud cues can be disseminated across the 
growing number of online resources and communities of practice that have emerged pertaining to Internet 
fraud. The knowledge gained in this study could also be applied towards the development of a browser 
plug-in to help protect against fake escrow websites.
