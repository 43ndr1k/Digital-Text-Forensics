The Qur'an Annotation for Text Mining
3 Abdul-Baquee Sharaf- Transfer Report
CHAPTER 1 – INTRODUCTION
This report presents my PhD research plan and provides the material for transfer review meeting. My
research project aims at the discovery and extraction of interesting, non-trivial knowledge from the
Qur'an using text mining techniques. There has been lots of research on the topic of text mining,
mainly from biomedical field. The primary goal has been to retrieve knowledge that is hidden in text,
and to present the filtered knowledge to users in a concise form. Text mining differs from data mining
in the nature of the target data. While data mining investigated “structured” data residing in
databases, text mining intends to mine for knowledge hidden in “unstructured” data within free texts.
Text mining thus adds a layer of complexity in making the unstructured text ready for data mining
algorithms. To this end, one of the challenging and laborious tasks has been to annotate the text
under investigation with various linguistic information prior to applying machine learning and text
mining algorithms.
To our knowledge, no academic research exists on text mining the Qur’an, and our objective is to
pioneer a research enriching the raw Qur’an with linguistic and conceptual annotation and use it to
“mine” for interesting knowledge hidden in the Qur’an.
In this introduction, I will first elaborate on my motivation and rationale for choosing the Qur’an as
my candidate text for mining, and then I will present the scope of this project. Next I will highlight the
novelty and original contribution of this research. Finally, I will outline the structure of the rest of this
report.
1.1 – MOTIVATION AND BACKGROUND
The Qur’an is the religious text for Muslims. According to Muslims it is the words of God revealed on
the prophet Muhammad 1443 years ago in classical Arabic language. The Qur’an claims to contain
valuable information and gives answer and solution to many problems facing mankind. It also claims
to be free from contradictions and discrepancies. In various places, the Qur’an challenged the
mankind to author a book or a chapter of a book that would resemble the Qur’an in content and
style. The Qur’an contains around 77,000 words which are organized into 114 varying size chapters
called surahs. Each chapter in turn contains varying size verses or ayat (in total over 6200 verses). The
Qur'anic scholars in the past fifteen centuries have been authoring books highlighting various
linguistic, stylistic, scientific, rhetorical, and many hidden discoveries from the Qur’an in various other
fields. Obviously, these scholars have been relying on their personal knowledge and familiarity of the
Qur’an as no computational tools were available then. The Qur'an is characterized by holding vast
information in unstructured and scattered –yet conceptually related- verses.
All these features make the Qur'an an attractive target for computational text mining with the
objective of finding new information from the Qur'an in terms of hidden trends, relationships,
patterns, coincidences and associations. Moreover, a historical analysis of the chronology of Qur’anic
revelation gives more significance to the task of text mining from the Qur’an.
HISTORICAL BACKGROUND
The Qur'an was revealed over 23 years of the lifetime of the prophet Muhammad who was 40 years
old when the first verse was revealed in the city of Makkah. The prophet started to preach these
verses; initially secretly and later openly. The overarching theme of the Qur’anic verses is the
emphasis on the monotheism doctrine in worshiping only one God and opposing the general
polytheistic belief of the people of Makkah. Hence, majority opposed this new religion, but gradually
adherents increased. The mission of Muhammad continued 13 years in Makkah. The general theme of
the verses and chapters revealed in Makkah thus emphasized in establishing logical proofs for
The Qur'an Annotation for Text Mining
4 Chapter 1 – Introduction | FIRST YEAR TRANSFER REPORT
monotheism detailing on the attributes of God and His supreme power. This is illustrated often by
relating stories of past people and prophets and what happened to them when they rejected the
monotheistic message. In general Makkah surahs emphasized the establishment of the monotheism
doctrine, the prophethood of Muhammad and the reality of the Day of Judgment. As the people of
Makkah were masters of the classical Arabic language, Prophet Muhammad considered this Qur'an –
being the words of God- a miracle and challenged the Arabs of Makkah to bring a similar chapter like
the Qur'an. Thus, the chapters of Makkah –in addition to the monotheistic tone- had a secondary
objective of being literal, rhetorical and linguistic challenge for Arabs. This is evident is selection of
strong words, phrases and Arabic constructs in Makki verses.
Later, the prophet migrated to Medina where the people welcomed him and allowed Islam to rule
that city. Verses revealed in Medinah started to lay down Islamic law and jurisprudence, in addition to
the continuing theme of Islamic monotheism. Medina period witnessed many battles of Islam and
eventually Islam expanded to other nearby cities and tribes. In general, Medina surahs emphasized on
establishing Islamic laws, ethics, morals, marital and family laws, monetary transactions, and
relationship of Islam and Muslims with other world religions.
The above historical background gives us motivation to employ machine learning and text mining
techniques to analyze the Qur’an in search for trends, patterns, association and distinguishing
relationships in between and within those chapters revealed in Makkah and those revealed in
Medinah. Moreover, these techniques can be used to extract feature sets for each chapters of the
Qur’an which together can represent a unique signature for the Qur’anic authorship that might give
some insight into the unique nature of the language of God. Chapter 5.3 discusses in detail some
experiments I carried out exploiting some of these features to distinguish between Makki and Madani
chapters.
RATIONALE
Motivated by the facts elaborated above, and after reviewing the literature and existing tools and
techniques, we can rationalize further this project in the following points.
There has been increasing interests in Arabic NLP research. The first step towards such research is the
preparation of a text annotated with various layers of linguistic features. The rich annotation and
resources developed by this project will enable further research on the Qur’an or in classical Arabic in
general.
The Qur’an being around 77,000 tokens (and around 15,000 types) is small in size by statistical
analysis standards (Church and Mercer 1993). However, it is typical for many text mining and corpus
linguistics projects to analyse works of a particular author. For example, (Plaisant et al 2006) mined
for erotic expressions in Emily Dickenson's correspondence. (Stubbs 2005) used corpus linguistics in
quantitative stylistics on Conrad. (Starcke 2006) analyzed Jane Austen and (Mahlberg 2007) focused
on Dickens. See chapter 2 for more works.
The relative small size of the Qur’an rationalizes the feasibility of the annotation task. Moreover,
repetitive constructs in the Qur’an and the nature of extensive rule based traditional Arabic grammar
will enable semi-automated annotation and thus make it feasible to manage within a PhD scope.
There are considerable computational works on text analysis of the Bible. For example, University of
Stellenbosch hosted the Association Internationale Bible et Informatique conference (AIBI-6) in the
year 2000 under the theme of "from Alpha to Byte" (Cook 2002) bringing together many
computational research on Bible. Refer to chapter 2 for more details. These bible researches
rationalize initiating similar research on the Qur'an which shares the same genre.
The Qur'an Annotation for Text Mining
5 Abdul-Baquee Sharaf- Transfer Report
The Qur'an being a book extensively studied over the past 15 centuries is characterized by the
availability of a huge library of scholarly works on Qur'anic exegesis, literary analysis and linguistic
commentaries. These works will provide useful material in preparing annotation guidelines, learning
algorithms and in evaluating text mining results.
Traditional Arabic grammar is characterized by a large set of rules that caters well for various
complexities of the language. Moreover, the Qur'an has been exhaustively analysed syntactically –
albeit not in computational format. These rules and analysis rationalize for learning classifiers for the
Qur'an and classical Arabic.
The field of machine learning and text mining have seen many off-the-shelf classifiers which can save
much effort in developing algorithms and allow more effort to prepare and enrich the raw Qur’an text
as input to these algorithms.
1.2 – PROBLEM STATEMENT
This research project aims at creating an enabling computational environment for text mining the
Qur’an. This involves defining the text mining objectives, and based on that annotating the raw
Qur’an with linguistic and domain information. Using this annotated corpus, various text mining tasks
including: information extraction, text categorization, concept linkage and discovery of associations
and patterns are tested and evaluated.
The project adopts CRoss Industry Standard Process for Data Mining or CRISP-DM (Shearer 2000)
methodology, and considers investigating chapters 2 and 7 of the Qur’an as a pilot project before
focusing later on the entire Qur’an.
1.3 – CONTRIBUTION AND NOVELTY
The originality, contribution and novelty of this research can be considered in the following areas:
 Developing specialized corpus and resources for text mining the Qur’an in particular and NLP
research on classical Arabic in general.
 Pioneering the research in the field of text mining the Qur’an by enriching the raw Qur’an
with annotation and developing other necessary resources.
 Using various existing machine learning algorithms in a novel way for the first time in the
domain of religious scripture written in classical Arabic – i.e., the Qur’an.
1.4 – ORGANIZATION OF THIS REPORT
The rest of this report is organized as follows. Chapter 2 is a literature review investigating existing
resources, tool and techniques both for the Qur’an and text mining. Chapter 3 gives detailed overview
of the research plan following the six phases of the CRISP-DM methodology. Chapter 4 gives an
overview of the work completed so far. Chapter 5, elaborates further my work progress through some
computational exercises I carried out on the Qur’an. Finally, chapter 6 concludes the report
highlighting on my contribution and rationalizing why I should proceed further in this research and
get a ‘green light’ in this review meeting.

CHAPTER 2- LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1 QUR'ANIC RESOURCES
The original Arabic Quran has been circulating in digital form online for some time. However, early
copies used to suffer from errors mainly due to missing diacritics and lack of encoding techniques to
incorporate special characters that match the printed Quran. Motivated by these shortcomings, there
have been few projects to produce error-free machine readable Quran. Most famous among them is
the Tanzil project [http://tanzil.info/] which allows downloading the Quranic text in various formats
including XML and SQL dump. I used these resources in carrying out my experiments so far, see
chapter 5 for details.
Searching the Quran has been the focus of many websites. However, in most cases searches were
limited to Keyword search as in http://www.islamicity.com/QuranSearch/. A number of sites allow
root word search as well, for example: http://tanzil.info/. Similarly, there have been few sites allowing
proximity or Boolean search over English translation of the Quran, for example
http://quod.lib.umich.edu/k/koran/.
There have been many early works by Quranic scholars of Tafsir (the scholarly comments on the
Quran). A common trend followed by many scholars of Tafsir is to attempt understanding first a verse
by relating it with other verses, then relating it to Haidth (saying of the Prophet Muhammad), then
commentaries made by students of Prophet Muhammad (and their students), and finally analysing
classical Arabic lexicons. Most notable books of Tafsir following this methodology are (At-Tabari
2000), (Al-Baghawi 1997) and (IbnKatheer 1999), which are also available online in machine readable
form.
There are few books that only explain the difficult vocabulary of the Quran, for example (Ad-Dinawry
1978). Also, another category of books deal with the science of Quran and Tafsir where the focus is
not exhaustively on every verse but to extract general rules that help understanding the Quran. (As-
Soyouti 1987) and (As-Sabt 1996) are two such works.
Traditional Arabic grammar defines many syntactic rules that relate words and segments in a
sentence. There has been many works in Arabic that exhaustively produces grammatical parsing for
the Quran for example (Salih 2007),(Al-Kharrat 2007) and (Darwish 1999).
(Al-Qahtani 2005) gives an extensive categorization of modern standard Arabic verb valence based on
Case Grammar (CG) as described by (Fillmore 1968). Based on the assumption that CG is adequate to
classify all verbs of a language and is universal across languages, Al-Qahtani went on to specify
valence according to Cook’s Matrix Model (Cook 1979) and its extension that includes 24 cells.
According to this matrix five cases (Agent, Experiencer, Benefactive, Object, Locative) are plotted
horizontally and type of verb (State, Process, Action) vertically. The date was taken from 8327 verbs
from a lexicon (Al-Qahtani 2003) and most frequent 200 verbs were exhaustively sorted to a cell in
the matrix, and thus proved the suitability of Cook’s model for Arabic valence.
(Fiteih 1983) studied the prepositional verbs considering the Quran as his corpus. He could classify
four classes of Quranic verbs based on the number and type of nominals and prepositions these verbs
allow. There are cases when a verb allows one prepositional object (e.g., reach to something as in
[2.1]), or a nominal and a prepositional object (e.g., send against someone something as in [2.2]), or
two prepositional objects (e.g., come forth unto someone from some place as in [2.3]), or one
The Qur'an Annotation for Text Mining
7 Abdul-Baquee Sharaf- Transfer Report
nominal object and two prepositional objects [2.4a] or one prepositional object and two nominal
objects [2.4b].
[2.1] And when he saw their hands reached not to it, he mistrusted them.. [11:70]
[2.2] For We sent against them a furious wind, [54:19 Yusuf Ali Translation]
[2.3] Then he came forth unto his people from the sanctuary [19:11]
[2.4] a. And Allah hath favoured some of you above others in provision [16:71]
b. He hath bestowed on those who strive a great reward above the
sedentary[4:95]
(Shamsan 1986) studies the transitivity and intransitivity of Quranic verbs. He analyzed the valences
of these verbs and tried to link between the form of these verbs and the semantic significance. He
also observed the shift of a verb from intransitive to transitive sense based on semantic
characteristics.
(Mir 1989) observed that quite a lot verbs in the Quran are used in idiomatic sense rather than literal
meaning of the verb. He went on to list such expressions in the Quran. Some examples are given in
the following quote.
When a man’s “eyes become cool”, it means that he is pleased. A person who “brings down
his wing” for you is being kind to you, but if he “bites his fingers” at you, he holds you a
severe grudge. If you think you lack the gift of fluent speech, you can pray to God to “untie
the knot in your tongue” (Mir 1989: 2-3)
There is not much computational research on the Qur’an. Here I present only two academic
researches I could find. (Thabet 2005) applied hierarchical cluster analysis to lexical frequency data
abstracted from the Qur'an to see if this would yield a classification of the chapters which could be
useful in understanding its thematic structure (particularly the Makki from Madani). The results were
interesting, but were compromised by a problem caused by the large variation in the length of the
chapters, which range from fewer than ten words to several thousand.
(Shenassa and Khalvandi 2008) evaluated the verbs in chapters 2 and 3 of five English translation of
the Qur’an in comparison with original Arabic verb and checked against the number of similarity
between translations and source in terms of verb process according to Halliday Grammar. They found
that Yousuf Ali’s translation is better than others.
BIBLE STUDIES
Computational tasks on the Bible can prove useful for the Qur’an as both might fall under the same
genre. There are few projects on the Bible. (Resnik et al 1999) described an ongoing project to create
parallel multilingual corpus for the 66-books of Bible tagged with information about book, chapter
and verse. (Chew et al 2006) evaluated the Bible to be a resource for cross-lingual information
retrieval. To measure similarity their retrieval system constructed a matrix of 31,104 by 31,104 for
each language pair where each cell measured similarity between two languages. They retrained the
system on the Arabic Qur’an and three other languages: English, Russian, and Spanish.
2.2 SUBJECTIVITY ANALYSIS
Recently there has been an eruption of research activities in the area of opinion and sentiment mining
(Pang and Lee 2008) because of a surge of opinionated information available online. Opinion and
sentiment mining falls under general "subjectivity analysis" of a text (Banfield 1982) as opposed to
traditional objective fact-based analysis. Other elements that can fall under subjectivity analysis are
The Qur'an Annotation for Text Mining
8 Chapter 2- Literature Review | FIRST YEAR TRANSFER REPORT
emotion and speculation. The Qur'an is a text that contains both objective fact-based statements (2.5
and 2.7 below from verse 98:5-6) as well as opinions either positive (segment 2.6 below) or negative
(segment 2.8 below).
(2.5) <objective>And they were not commanded except to worship Allah , [being] sincere to
Him in religion, inclining to truth, and to establish prayer and to give zakah.</objective>
(2.6) <subj-positive> And that is the correct religion.</subj-positive>
(2.7) <objective> Indeed, they who disbelieved among the People of the Scripture and the
polytheists will be in the fire of Hell, abiding eternally therein. </objective>
(2.8) <subj-negative>Those are the worst of creatures </sub-negative> [98:5,6]
Opinion mining can be broken into the following subtasks (Popescu and Etzioni 2005; Esuli and
Sebastiani 2006):
1. Identify product features
2. From a review text identify the sentences/phrases which are fact-based (objective) and those
which has positive-negative polarity (subjective)
3. If a sentence/phrase is subjective, determine its polarity (positive or negative)
4. Determine the strength of the polarity (e.g., very positive, mild negative, etc.)
(Popescu and Etzioni 2005) had decomposed the problem of review mining into the four subtasks
above: identify product features, identify opinions regarding product features, determine the polarity
of opinions and ranking opinions based on their strength. Their system takes as input a product and a
set of reviews, and outputs a set of product features, accompanied by a list of ranked associated
opinions. They started with parsing the review texts by MINIPAR (Lin 1998) and applied simple
pronoun resolution. Explicit features are extracted through an information extraction system called
KnowItAll (Etzioni et al. 2005) which finds candidate facts through generic extraction patterns and
assesses the results using PMI (Point-wise mutual information) on web searches. They also employ
WordNet in distinguishing parts from properties while finding explicit features. Again, they use
WordNet synonymy and antonymy information to group the adjectives in a set of initial clusters while
finding implicit features. In the subtask of finding opinion phrases, they employ relaxation labelling
method to find the semantic orientation of words in the context of given product features and
sentences. Thus this unsupervised classifier takes a set of semantic orientation labels like {positive,
negative, neutral} and a set of objects (like words) along with initial probabilities on associations and
neighborhood influence, and the classifier then assigns globally labels to objects taking into account
local constraints. Their system relies on various extraction rules.
I think this paper is rich in using a wide range of NLP and machine learning techniques and many
Qur'an mining tasks can be approached in similar ways. This paper gives rationale for annotating the
Qur'an with syntactic, named entity and pronoun resolution as well as creating a wordnet type of
lexical resource for Qur'anic words.
(Esuli and Sebastiani 2006) described SentiWordNet, a lexical resource which quantified each wordnet
synset into objective, positive and negative scores that sum up to 1.0. For example, the adjective
[estimable (3)] in wordnet means "maybe computed or estimated" is always objective terms and has
score of (objective=1.0, positive=0.0, negative=0.0), whereas [estimable(1)] meaning "deserving of
respect or high regard" is given a score of (objective=0.25, positive =0.75, negative=0.0). This work
The Qur'an Annotation for Text Mining
9 Abdul-Baquee Sharaf- Transfer Report
can inspire creating Wordnet type of hierarchy for the Qur'an as well as tagging each sense in with
similar objective, positive and negative scores.
(Wiebe et al 2005) describes MPQA or Multi-Perspective Question Answering opinion corpus which
contains manual annotation of over 15,000 subjective expressions in nearly 9,000 sentences with
contextual polarity of positive, negative, both or neutral as expressed in examples below (subjective
expression underlined and polarity in brackets).
(2.9) Thousands of coup supporters celebrated (positive) overnight, waving flags, blowing
whistles . . .
(2.10) The criteria set by Rice are the following: the three countries in question are repressive
(negative) and grave human rights violators (negative)
(2.11) Besides, politicians refer to good and evil (both) only for purposes of intimidation and
exaggeration.
(2.12) Jerome says the hospital feels (neutral) no different than a hospital in the states.
Inter-annotator agreement for this corpus was 82% and kappa value of 0.72. The corpus is publicly
available with annotation guideline and can help us in annotating subjective expressions in the
Qur'an.
(Turney 2002) takes a review text, tags it through Brill POS tagger for adjectives and adverbs and then
identifies the semantic orientation of the phrases in this text as positive or negative. Finally the given
review is assigned a class as recommended (thumbs up) or not recommended (thumbs down) based
on the average of the semantic orientations of the phrases. Semantic orientation of a phrase is
calculated by PMI of that phrase with a reference word like "excellent" or "poor". After POS tagging,
he extracted pharses of two words based on defined patterns involving mainly the pattern (JJ NN) like
"low fees" or "online experience".
Various non-factual applications of text mining are shown in the following table.

2.3 STYLISTICS ANALYSIS
Two factors that characterize a text are content and style. According to Muslims, the Qur'an is
considered miraculous in both these aspects. Style of a text can be analyzed through a set of
measurable patterns called style markers. Works in computational stylistics exists for genre detection
and authorship attribution. Two main computational tasks involved are the extraction of the style
markers and classification of the text according to these markers.
Popular style markers focus on distributional lexical measures at token level (e.g., word count,
sentence count, character per word count, punctuation marks count, etc.), syntactic annotation (e.g.,
passive count, nominalization count, frequency of certain POS, etc.), vocabulary richness (e.g., type-
token ratio, count of words occurring once, i.e., hapax legomena, count of words occurring twice, i.e.,
dislegomena, etc.) or counting frequency of some common words or function words.
(Holmes 1992) uses multivariate statistical approach to tackles the problem of author attribution. He
measures the richness of vocabulary through five variables which are based on distribution of the
frequency of tokens and types with relationship with text length. Among the variables is also analysis
of hapax legomena and hapax dislegomena. He then applied this analysis on the Book of Mormon
which Joseph Smith claims to be a translation of ancient God revelation and "Doctrines and
Covenants" which also claims to be a direct revelation from God. These writings are compared with
several of Joseph Smiths personal writings through against the defined five vocabulary richness
variables. If the claims of Joseph Smith was correct, then these works should form separate clusters,
but the analysis showed the opposite suggesting that Smith may have claimed his own writings to be
a revelation from God. This stylometric analysis can be valuable for our project in distinguishing
between the sayings of Prophet Muhammad and the Qur'an text, also in checking the stylistic
difference between Makki and Madani chapters.
(Stamatatos et al 2000) describes a system for author attribution and genre detection tested on Greek
corpus but can work in any application. They chose style markers that are adapted to the output of
existing NLP tools like POS tagger (word, sentence, punctuation), and that which are adaptable to
analysis-level of the NLP tool (like words remained unanalyzed after certain pass). They used
multivariate text categorization tools.
2.4 TEXT CATEGORIZATION
Automated text classification is the task of assigning a category to a document. This task can be
"hard" where the system should make binary decision on choosing the right category, or it could be
"soft" –or semi-automated- where the system only presents a list of ranked possibilities and a human
makes the decision (Sebastiani 2002).
There are two main approaches towards text categorization: knowledge engineering approach and
machine learning approach (Feldman and Sanger 2007).
Knowledge engineering approach towards text categorization is achieved through manual
development of classification rules by a domain expert. An example of such a system is CONSTRUE
system (Hayes 1992) for Reuters. The drawback of such approach is the labor intensive effort to
develop such a knowledgebase.
The Qur'an Annotation for Text Mining
11 Abdul-Baquee Sharaf- Transfer Report
In the machine learning approach, the classifier is built automatically by learning the properties of
categories from a set of preclassified training set. (Sebastiani 2002) is a good survey of various
machine learning classifiers and table 2.2 below gives a summary of best performance results among
each category of classifiers.

Naїve Bayes probabilistic classifier (Dumais et al. 1998) 0.815
Rocchio batch linear (Joachims 1998) 0.799
Table 2.2 – Popular classifiers for text categorization and their performance
It is evident that SVM, boosting and regression methods perform the best. (Yang 1999) has found that
various methods perform comparably when training set contains over 300 instances per category, but
when the number of positive instance in training data are small (like 10 instances) then regression like
methods like linear least-square or k-nearest neighbours are better.
(Blake and Pratt 2001) highlight the importance of selecting features that are semantically rich and
thus informative and useful to the domain. They showed empirical results from medical domain.
Selecting a feature considering the phrase "breast cancer" is richer semantically than choosing two
separate features as "breast" and "cancer", because the former is a domain term which can be
equated with "neoplasm of the breast". This work highlights the importance of domain knowledge in
selecting semantically rich feature set prior to learning classifiers on these features. In our project we
also need to find semantically rich set of features to represent Qur'an which branches from domain
and ontological knowledge and not just linguistic features. These features will follow directly from the
nature of text mining queries intended from Qur'an: a task we will carry during the pilot project.
2.5 CLUSTERING
Clustering is an unsupervised task to group unlabelled text into meaningful clusters without prior
information. Documents are usually represented as a vector of features –often bag of words- and the
task is to cluster these documents based on some similarity function. (Dhillon et al 2002) shows that
this task is very computationally expensive and only 5,000 webpage can contain a vocabulary size of
15,000 words, which is a bottleneck for most effective clustering algorithms like support vector
machines or k-nearest neighbour, etc. (Hotho et al. 2003) shows that incorporating background
knowledge –in their case WordNet synset- makes clustering more efficient with an increase of 10% in
purity. (Bloehdorn and Hotho 2006) extended the work using boosting algorithms and incorporating
medical (MeSH Tree structure Ontology) and agricultural ontology (AGROVOC). These work motivate
us to create domain ontology for the Qur’an and my pilot project should give a good assessment on
the feasibility of such task.

2.6 PATTERN DISCOVERY: DISTRIBUTIONS, FREQUENT SETS AND ASSOCIATIONS
One of the most “lucrative” promises of text mining is the discovery of hidden information. For
example, in our context, we might want to see the proportions of verses in the Qur’an that describes
the concept of “fighting” and their distribution across Makki and Madani chapters. We might want to
narrow the focus and want to see a distribution of verses mentioning both “praying” and “fasting”
together. When we restrict the frequency to a minimum support level then we are interested in
frequent and near frequent sets (Feldman and Sanger 2007). Finding such frequent sets is a step
towards fining associations. An association rule presents a relation between two concepts, for
example, a link between the concepts of “fighting” in the Qur’an “Madani surah” is evident in the
Qur’an, as the Prophet was not in position to fight while in Makkah. These probable association is
investigated in terms of confidence and support, for example, we might say “80% of verses that
mention ‘prayer’ also mention ‘Zakat (giving alms) and 1.5% of all verses of the Qur’an mentions both
prayer and Zakat. Machine learning can be employed for finding all association rules with a user-
defined confidence and support. (Agrawal et al. 1993) is a seminal work in this field and focus on
investigating market-basket type of association for example finding that “90% of transactions that
purchase bread and butter also purchase milk”. (Amir et al. 2003) introduces the concept of maximal
association rules. It is motivated by phenomenon in text where “Linux” is associated with low
confidence (wrongly) with “open source” because of high confidence of associating with “windows”.
They described algorithm to overcome this problem.
(Silberschatz and Tuzhilin 1996) gives a good presentation on the topic of “interestingness” of the
patterns produced by data mining tools. It is noted that many patterns returned are not interesting to
the human user. They emphasize on subjective view of interestingness that vary from one user to
other in oppose to objective measures like the confidence and support. They considered a pattern
interesting to a user for two reasons: a) when it is unexpected and hence ‘surprising’ and b) when the
user can ‘do’ something with it. In our context this provides good material when we define the
objective of our system and what the user community – mainly Qur’anic scholars – consider
interesting from a text mining on the Qur’an.
2.7 TEXT MINING IN BIOLOGY AND BIOMEDICINE
There is an overwhelming amount of biomedical knowledge in textual form that triggered lots of
research in text mining this domain particularly. These researchers are eager to generate new
hypothesis after discovering associations, patterns and trends from past knowledge (Swanson 1990).
Text mining is being applied in areas such as finding functional relationship among genes, establishing
functional annotations, discovering protein-protein interactions, interpreting array experiments,
associating genes and phenotypes, etc (Ananiadou and McNaught 2006). This field has flourished
through increasing number of dedicated workshops, tutorial, etc. A centre has been established in UK
called NACTEM to provide text mining service to the academic community. Researches in this field
are helpful for my project as both deal with a domain dependent text mining. Many lexical,
terminological and ontological resources exist in this field (Bodenreider 2006) that might motivate
building similar knowledge repositories for the Qur’an. There are several corpora available which are
annotated with both linguistic as well as conceptual information with detailed annotation guidelines
(Kim and Tsujii 2006) which will prove helpful in our project. Moreover being domain dependent,
several biomedicine text mining system relied on rule-based information extraction (McNaught and
Black 2006) which can perform well for the Qur’an mining as well. (Park and Kim 2006) presents
researches in named entity recognition in biology which relied on various methods like dictionary-
based, rule-based, machine learning, and hybrid methods.

The Qur'an Annotation for Text Mining
14 Chapter 3 - Detailed Description of the project | FIRST YEAR TRANSFER REPORT
In what follows, we adopt this model for the purpose of our text mining project and describe each
phases and steps accordingly.
3.1 PHASE 1 – BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING
This phase assesses the objectives of this project and the value it will add to our clients (i.e., mainly
the Qur'anic scholars). Then translates these objectives into specific technical objectives in text
mining terms, assess the available tools and resources and produce a detailed plan. Following are
more elaboration on each of these steps.
3.1.1 DETERMINE THE BUSINESS OBJECTIVE
In this step, we are interested in identifying our key clients who would benefit from this project. Next,
identify what each of these clients want from this project – i.e., their key objectives and queries from
our text mining system. What are the key success factors and how to measure each of these factors?
WHO ARE THE USER COMMUNITY?
Our system should be beneficial to a wide range of user community. Following are the main category
of users:
Qur'anic scholars: they are the main beneficiary of our system. They are familiar with the content of
the Qur'an, and hence are generally not interested in knowing if certain piece of information is or is
not in the Qur'an. Rather, they want to validate empirically many findings and claims made by early
Qur'anic scholars on certain rules concerning the Qur'an. In general, they should feel very excited by a
tool that enables them to carry empirical analysis on the Qur'an which would otherwise be very
tedious or impossible by manual investigation.
Arabic Scholars: they are interested in Qur'an as being a text of classical Arabic. They want to search
for Qur'anic evidence in support for some Arabic grammar rules. They want to read concordance lines
for the usage of certain lexical terms and observe the behaviour of certain part-of-speech. In general
their interest matches with the field of computational stylistics.
Qur'anic students: they are perhaps non-Arabs but have interest in the Qur'an both for content and
language. They want to search for contents: either beyond keyword or without having the knowledge
of proper keywords, and hence want to search by topics and concepts. They want to learn how
various Qur’anic words are related linguistically to each other by relations like synonym, hyponym,
metonym, etc.
WHAT THEY WANT?
Each user category identified above would benefit from our system differently. Their expectations
might be very high. However, we need to scale down the full set of client objectives into feasible and
realistic objectives given the scope of a PhD research. Following table lists this shortlist of objectives
per user category.
User What they want?
Qur'anic Scholar - Validate existing claims by early scholars through empirical methods
- Link scattered but related verses
- Find interesting correlations and association between verses
Arabic Scholar - Qur'anic evidence of grammar rules
- Linguistic behaviour of certain words or POS
Qur'anic Students - Search for a topic or concept
- Hierarchical relation of Qur'anic words
Table 3.1 – Key users and their objective from Qur'anic text mining solution
The Qur'an Annotation for Text Mining
15 Abdul-Baquee Sharaf- Transfer Report
It is worth noting that this initial set of objectives needs to be revisited and amended after conducting
the pilot study. Following are elaborations with examples on some of the objectives mentioned in the
above table.
As the Qur'an has been a subject of extensive scholarly research by early Muslims, we have access to
many observations, findings and claims based on manual investigation of the Qur'an. For example,
finding distinctive characteristics that differentiates Makki verses from Madani verses has been a
subject of interests by many early scholars. Some of them (Maimoun Ibn Mihran, see (As-Soyouti
1987 p. 52)) made a generic observation that whenever the construct "O mankind" is used in a verse,
then this verse must be Makki, and whenever the construct "O you who believe" is used in a verse,
then this verse must be a Madani . Another scholar made a claim that when certain chapter starts
with some initial letters, then these letters are the most frequently used letters in that chapter, or
words containing these letters in that chapter carries the theme of that chapter. Our text mining
system will enable scholars for the first time to empirically validate these findings.
The Qur'an describes itself in the verse 39:23 as "a consistent Book wherein is reiteration". There are
many verses –and segments within a verse - in the Qur'an that attach to the same concept or topic.
For example, in 80 different scattered verses a command to perform prayer (i.e., the second pillar of
Islam) has been followed by a command to pay Zakat (i.e., an annual expenditure to be paid for the
needy, and the third pillar of Islam). Sometimes it is difficult even for Qur'anic experts to relate all
these instances in memory. And an analytical tool would be of great help in this regard. Figures 3.7
and 3.11 in the following pages provide more appreciation of this feature.
The word "Ummah" was mentioned 49 times in the Qur'an. This word is commonly used in modern
standard Arabic to mean a nation, like the term "al-Ummah al-Islamiyyah" meaning "the Islamic
nation" or the term "al-umam al-muttahidah" meaning "the United Nations". However reading the
concordance lines in the Qur'an, a researcher would notice that this word has three different
meanings mostly to mean 'a nation', but also to mean 'a short period' as in verse 11:8, or a 'leader' as
in verse 16:120. A wordnet type of hierarchy of Qur'anic words will be of great benefit both for
learning purpose and other computational tasks.
WHAT ARE THE SUCCESS CRITERIA?
These objectives must be further justified by setting measurable success criteria. Any computational
exercise should not be attempted if manual work can achieve the same result with minimum effort.
Table 3.2 below is a list of success criteria and their measure for our project.
Success criteria How to measure?
Discovered new correlation Verified as OK by Qur'anic scholars
Related verses are linked Precision and recall
Finding errors in early claims Verified as OK by Qur'anic scholars
Positive feedback from users Starred ratings
Accepted publications How reputed is the conference or journal
Table 3.2 – how to measure success of this project
Following is more elaborations on some of the points mentioned in the table above.
Qur'an is a very complex text for machine understanding and various external and contextual factors
need to be considered. Any results produced computationally showing apparent trends or
correlations need to be verified by Qur'anic scholars.
The Qur'an Annotation for Text Mining
16 Chapter 3 - Detailed Description of the project | FIRST YEAR TRANSFER REPORT
Many books of Tafsir (Qur'anic commentary) when commenting on a verse, cite some of the other
verses that are related. Taking this set of verses as a benchmark, our system can be evaluated by
adding more related verses (i.e., more recall), which are verified to be correctly related by scholars
(i.e., precision). Figure 3.11 depicts this concept where many scattered verses accumulatively
contributes to cover a certain topic or concept.
With text mining tools, it is easy to verify certain claims like the one made earlier on criteria to
differentiate Makki and Madani verses by the construct "O mankind". Chapter 2 which is a Madani
chapter mentions twice (verse 21 and 168) the construct "O mankind", thus refuting the claim that
this construct only occurs in Makki chapters.
An obvious measure of success of this project is the publication of paper in both Qur'anic studies and
text mining conferences. It is our intention to present papers to following list of conferences and
journals.

3.1.2 ASSESS THE SITUATION
In this step, we outline the resources, the assumptions, the risks and measures to mitigate them.
RESOURCES
In terms of data, we have machine-readable Qur'an available in the public domain [http://tanzil.info]
both as raw text and as XML format. We also have Haifa morphological and POS tagged corpus (Dror
et al. 2004) which is available publicly with 80% accuracy. The Quranic Arabic Corpus (Dukes and
Habash 2010) is also publicly available but is still undergoing manual verification. We also have a rich
library of Qur’anic science and Arabic grammar books which will help in preparing the annotation
guidelines process of the Qur’an.
In terms of tools, we have MMAX2 (Müller and Stube 2006) as a highly customizable tool for creating,
browsing, visualizing and querying linguistic annotations on multiple levels. Weka (Witten and Frank
2005 ) is a popular machine learning toolkit for learning classifiers, clustering and visualizing results.
NLTK provides good modular solution towards many text processing tasks. Chapter 5 details on some
of my experiments with these tools.
In terms of methodology we follow the general phases, steps and templates provided by CRISP-DM
guidelines. As for the machine learning classifiers for text mining, there are various type of algorithms
like probabilistic, decision trees, decision rules, regression, linear, example-based, Bayesian net,
The Qur'an Annotation for Text Mining
17 Abdul-Baquee Sharaf- Transfer Report
neural net, SVM or a committee of methods. Results show better performance of SVM classifiers,
however, the decision of the particular algorithm for this project is deferred after the pilot project.
As for the human resource, apart from me being the main researcher and Dr. Atwell being my
supervisor, this project may resort to the expertise of Dr. Hussein Abdul-Raof and Dr. Mustapha al-
Sheikh from Arabic and Middle Eastern Studies at Leeds University for consultation. Based on my
background, I feel comfortable working with this project, as I am fluent in Arabic and am very
conversant with the Qur'an and books of Tafsir and have developed skills in Qur'anic science over the
past 10 years. Moreover, I have six years industry experience in software quality assurance and ERP
solutions with SAP, which I believe will contribute positively towards the quality of this project.
ASSUMPTIONS
This project is a PhD research spanning duration of 3 years. There is no external funding available for
this project and thus has to rely on open source and publicly available solutions.
RISKS
It is important to assess and manage the risks that might affect this project. Following table is a
summary of potential risks and mitigation plan.
Risk Severity Mitigation
Unavailability of experts to verify results High Rely on a rich library of Qur'anic science
books
Unknown nature of text analysis features High Pilot project
Annotation tools unable to handle Arabic Medium Build in-house tools
Other research team doing similar work Low Find opportunities of collaborative work
and create annotation that are not
considered yet.
Table 3.4 – Risk assessment
There is a rich library of books on Tafsir and Qur'an science many of them are in the Brotherton
Library at Leeds University. Also many books are publicly available on the web in PDF format for
download. These resources are likely to contain enough information to validate the result of text
mining. Moreover, I have access to address of few Qur'anic scholars in Saudi Arabia who can be
consulted.
The project starts with a piloting task on chapters 2 and 7 of the Qur'an. As this project is first of its
kind on the Qur'an –to the best of my knowledge-, piloting was attempted to gain some
understanding on the type and level of annotation needed.
3.1.3 PROJECT PLAN
We breakdown the effort needed in this project based on industry standards as quoted by CRISP-DM.
The project plan has the following distribution of effort: 3% for business understanding; 40% for data
understanding (i.e., pilot project); 22% for data preparation (i.e., Qur'an annotation); 10% for
modelling; 5% for evaluation; and 20% for deployment (i.e., final thesis write-up). It must be noted
that this plan need to be monitored and revised regularly.

3.2 PHASE 2- DATA UNDERSTANDING
In this phase we carry on a pilot project with the objective to understand our text (i.e., the Qur'an)
more and determine the text mining scope and requirement for the entire Qur'an. Following are the
steps within this phase.
3.2.1 COLLECT THE INITIAL DATA
This involves selecting a representative section of the Qur'an which is likely to reflect the challenges
and various issues in the text mining task. We have chosen two chapters from the Qur'an; chapter 2
and chapter 7. This choice was made based on comparing various attributes and features which are
likely to influence text mining task. Chapter 2 is a Madani surah (i.e., revealed in Medina) and the
largest chapter in the Qur'an and contains a wide range of topics from legislations to stories of
prophets. Chapter 7 is a Makki surah and overlaps in some of the topics like the story of Moses and
creation of Adam. Together they contain 9,482 words comprising around 12% of the Qur'an.
Following table gives some information about these two surahs.

3.2.2 DESCRIBE THE DATA
This task involves investigating, analyzing and enriching our sample chapters with annotations as a
preparation of text mining step. Through this annotation process, we will gradually build some useful
resources for computational analysis of the Qur’an as well.

3.4.1 – SELECT THE MODELLING
Refer to chapter 2 (literature review) for a detailed overview of existing models. The choice of the
specific model is influenced by the nature of the new knowledge we are interested in and the natur
of the available annotation.

3.4.2 – GENERATE TEST DESIGN
In this task I will speficy the details of the input to the text mining algorithms. This involves defining
which data should be trained on, and which one to be tested with. I will also need to define the
number of tests and which feature parameters to include for each test, also, how to evaluate the
results and check for accuracy.
3.4.3 – BUILD MODEL
This involves running the text mining algorithms after setting the appropriate parameters. These
parameter setting need to be rationalized and well documented. After each running, the results need
to be recorded and documented for later analysis. Also, the outcome of these tests need to be
presented in an understandable way.
3.4.4 – ASSESS THE MODEL
This involves analyzing the outcome of the text mining algorithms for new discoveries and interesting
patterns and associations. This step directly links with the objective set at the beginning of the
project. Ideally, the results are to be verified by domain experts. As the Qur'an has a rich set of
scholarly commentaries available, and given my knowledge of the domain, these results can be
verified by me for accuracy. Based on assessment, different parameter settings, feature sets or
algorithm can be chosen to build a different model.
3.5 – PHASE 5 – EVALUATION
This phase involves evaluating our annotated corpus and text mining application against the stated
objectives. Does the outcome of our system consider being a new knowledge which could not be
discovered otherwise? Do the results satisfy the success criteria set earlier? If not, then how could we
improve the system -either by improving the algorithms or annotation- to meet our objectives? It is
possible to make minor adjustment to our model and repeat phase 4. As part of evaluation, the
system –or part of it- will be made available online for public use and evaluation. It is unlikely at this
stage that the project is a complete failure and results are far away from being interesting, as our
pilot project would have detected drastic deviation from objectives.
Also at this phase, we document future enhancements and improvements of this project. Being a
pioneering text mining project on the Qur'an, this project must have many opportunities for
continuation. One of the objectives of the project is to create a framework for other researchers to
build on and add more annotation layers and text mining tasks.
At this stage, we have enough experimentation to publish journal paper reporting on our
methodology, the annotation process, the framework of text mining and various experiments
undertaken.

CHAPTER 4 – FIRST YEAR PROGRESS
This chapter gives an overview of the progress made so far in my first year at Leeds. The progress is
categorized into: training and development progress and those related to my research area.
4.1 – TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT
In my first session I have enrolled in a number of graduate and undergraduate courses as well as
workshops. These sessions proved helpful both in building network and settling in a foreign country as
well as in providing background to my research. Table 4.1 below gives a summary.

Table 4.1 – Training Courses
I participated in the training and development needs analysis and compared my progress at month
one and month 10 which showed significant improvement. The form is annexed in the appendix.
Also, I participate regularly in weekly discussion group of the NLP team and presented twice my
research proposals. In addition I attended few interesting presentations by the “knowledge
representation group” (now “intelligence augmented (IA)) and “Arabic and Islamic and Studies”.
One of my great networking and training opportunity came when participated in Corpus Linguistics
conference in Liverpool on June 2009. Attendance in this conference enables attending many relevant
sessions and having informal discussion with many experts in the field. I am attaching ‘back to office’
report.
4.2 – RESEARCH PROGRESS
I started with developing technical background in terms of investigating available tools and resources
for the Qur’an. This involved experimenting with linguistic computing with Unix tools. I obtained the
Haifa corpus of Qur’anic POS and morphology and ran experiments with it. I also developed skills with
Natural language toolkit (NLTK) under python. Also, I learned data mining techniques with WEKA tool.
Chapter 5 gives a detailed account of these experiments.
I spent some time on studying the Arabic Grammar relations in the context of the Qur’an. This
resulted in developing a set of relations that can be represented as dependency graphs. This method
was then applied to small chapters of the Qur’an. This work is submitted for publication in (Dukes,
Eric and Sharaf 2010) for LREC 2010 (attached in Appendix).
The Qur'an Annotation for Text Mining
29 Abdul-Baquee Sharaf- Transfer Report
I also investigated the possibility of developing a FrameNet type of lexical resource for the Qur’an.
This resulted in collecting sample Qur’anic verbs and studying their valences and analyzing the
compatibility with FrameNet semantic roles. This work will be continued in the pilot project for
chapters 2 and 7. This preliminary investigation resulted in a successful work-in-progress publication
in the Corpus Linguistics conferences 2009 in Liverpool where I got opportunity to present the paper
and receive feedback. (Paper attached in the appendix).
I also investigated the possible application of a multi-layered annotated Qur’anic corpus for question-
answering system. This preliminary study resulted in a submission for an extended abstract for the
LREC 2010 conference. The results will be out by February 2010. (Extended abstract attached in
appendix).
I have gained much experience in the annotation process of discourse relations in Modern Standard
Arabic (MSA) by joining in the annotation project of Al-Saif and Markert. This work gave me insight in
developing annotation guidelines for discourse relations in the Qur’an.
In addition to my previous 10 years of exposure to Tafsir books (i.e., scholarly commentary on the
Qur’an), I investigated their usage as a background knowledge for the mining process. Especially (As-
Sabt 1996; As-Soyouti 1987) which lists a set of rules as well as validation criteria in the Qur’an that
can be integrated in our system.

CHAPTER 5 – COMPUTATIONAL EXPERIMENTS
In this chapter, I will report on some computational experiments I did with both raw Qur’an text, and
later when a morphologically tagged corpus became available very recently (i.e., the Quranic Arabic
Corpus).
5.1 - WORD FREQUENCY DISTRIBUTION
I took an authentic copy of the Arabic Qur’an text from (http://tanzil.info) and tokenized it and did
basic counting of words. Here is a list of the 100 most frequent words.

Table 5.2 – Most frequent 150 function words in the Qur’an
Taking out the function words brings the list of content words for the Quran, as shown in table 5.3
next page. It is evident from the list the inherent problem of Arabic language where many prefix and
suffixes are attached to the word without any whitespace. For example, the word ‘Allah’ alone counts
2151, but when we add those tokens with clitics like ‘waAllah’ (and/by Allah), ‘biAllah’ (by Allah),
‘liAllah’ (for Allah) we have total of 2,657 occurrence. Also, the word ‘he said’ qaAla appears in our list
as different from the imperative ‘say’ qulo. Taking all ‘say’ roots and adding them brings the
frequency to 1,105 occurrences.
This problem makes it a supportive case for considering annotated corpus where morphological
tagging is added with information about lemma and root.

The above result was based purely on counting the words without any relative measure of likelihood
against a reference corpora. I could not find any reference corpora that captures classical Arabic, so I
made a comparison with the Corpus of Contemporary Arabic (CCA) developed by Latifa As-Sulaiti at
Leeds and publicly available at http://www.comp.leeds.ac.uk/eric/latifa/research.htm. It contains
587707 words from various genres like politics, fiction, religion, health, sports, education, economics
and science. Following table gives the results.

This list does not bring in new words which were absent in the earlier frequency list, but reorders the
ranks of some of the words (e.g., the word Moses was advanced to rank 11 -considering only content
words- after being in rank 20 without LL estimates). As we lack a reference corpus for classical Arabic
cotemporary to the time of the Qur’an revelation, and as the results without LL show similar results, I
will continue the analysis without considering LL comparison with CCA.
5.2 - N-GRAM
Next, I continue my analysis by counting the most frequent n-grams in the Qur’an starting from
bigrams until 5-gram. I used basic Unix commands of tail, paste, sort and uniq as follows.
# First take a raw file each token in a line and create another file
#translating by one
-bash-3.2$ tail -n+2 qtokens.dat>qtokens.next
#repeat the proces to the desired level

5.3 - MAKKI AND MADANI CHAPTERS
One of the topics that Qur’anic scholars always discussed is the Makki and Madani chapters of the
Qur’an. The 114 chapters are classified by scholars as either Makki or Madani based on their
chronological order of revelation in reference with the migration of Prophet Muhammad from
Makkah to Medinah. In respect with this classification, not all chapters are agreed between scholars,
and for a particular Makki chapter, there could be few verses revealed afterwards in Medinah, or vice
versa. I will investigate this issue further in the next chapter when learning classifiers in Weka.
Next, I created two files of the raw Qur’an, one which contains only makki chapters, and another only
madani chapters. Makki chapters contained 47,643 words (61.2%) of them 6,358 hapax legomena
(13.3%) and Madani chapters 30,161 words (38.8%) of them 4,621 hapax legomena (15.3%). Here are

Finally, here are few observations from the above two frequency lists:
1. The word ‘Allah’ tops the list in all categories emphasizing the central point of Islam
surrounding the monotheism creed. This is also true for the word ‘rabb (lord)’.
2. The verb ‘say’ appears frequently (ranked 2
nd
in Makki and 7
th
in Madani) where either Allah
‘says’ to mankind through this Qur’an, or commands is made by Allah to Muhammad to ‘say’
some message to the people.
3. Makki chapters refers more to signs of Allah in ‘nature’ like the Earth, skies, etc. to establish
logical proof of the sovereignty of Allah over the nature as opposed to the contemporary
belief of the polytheist Makkan people.
4. Makki surah does emphasize on ‘warning’ referring to words like ‘punishment’, ‘hell’, etc.
5. Stories of prophets like ‘Moses’ appears more in Makki chapters.
6. Madani chapters mentions ‘zakat’ which was obligated in Medina period.

QURANIC ARABIC CORPUS (QAC)
Very recently a POS tagged corpus was released on [http://quran.uk.net]. I repeated the process for
Makki and Madani considering this corpus. As this corpus indicates lemmas and root words, the
results are more accurate than working with raw text. From QAC I used the following tag-set as
function words and excluded in content word analysis.
TAG POS
'T' Time adverb
'DEM' demonstrative pronoun
'NEG' negation
'REL' relative pronoun
'P' particle
'PRON' pronoun
'ACC' accusative particle
'CONJ' conjunction
'RES' restriction particle
'COND' conditional particle
'INTG' interrogative
'SUB' subordinating conjunction
'INC' inceptive particle
'LOC' location adverb
'CERT' certainty particle
'ANS' answer particle
'SUP' surprise particle
'RET' retraction particle
Table 5.11 – QAC Tags used to exclude function words from my analysis
Following table gives a comparative analysis of the frequency of content keywords in all chapters
against Makki and Madani Chapters. From this analysis we could note the following points.
1. Makki chapters stress on the word ‘say’ where Muhammad is repeatedly commanded to say
the message of Islam to the people of Makkah. Makki chapters mentions lots of stories of
previous prophets and their conversation with their people.
2. as a result of the above the word ‘people’ also appears a lot in makki chapters. This is in the
context of a dialogue between a prophet –including Muhammad – and his tribe or people.
3. adding POS annotation in our analysis improved the accuracy of results, for example, in our
previous experiment for Makki chapters we got 807 occurrence of the word ‘Allah’ followed
by 339 of the word ‘say’, but here we recalled 2472 instance of ‘say’ and 1884 occurrence of
the word ‘Allah’ this brings both precision and recall higher.

Here are some observations from this list:
1. Some prophets like Joseph are only mentioned in Makki chapters
2. Prophet Muhammad established a state and started to contact other world religions only
after he migrated to Medinah, this is why words like ‘Christian’, ‘Jew’ appears only in Madani
chapters.
3. Acts of worship like ‘Hajj’ is obligated lately and hence is only mentioned in Madani chapters.
4. Muhammad only started military fighting after migration to Medinah, and hence the word
‘fighting’ was mentioned 26 times only in Madani chapters.
5. Many Madani chapter
reference to women like ‘chaste’, ‘believing women’ are mentioned.

5.4 - VERSE SIMILARITY APPLICATION
As highlighted several times in this report, one of the interesting feature in the Qur’an is the presence
of similar but scattered verses in the Qur’an. It is one of the objective of this research is to desgin text
mining applications to capture all these similar verses through mulit-layered annotation of the Qur’an.
In this experiment, I created a python program to input a user verse and print all other verses that
share 1/3 of the total number of content keywords of the source verse. Following is a snapshot of the
program.
Figure 5.1 – Python script for keyword similarity between verses
Analysing the results show that considering only keywords in similarity analysis still leaves many
similar verses undetected because they share ‘concepts’ and not ‘keywords’. This makes yet another
strong case for this research considering added layer of conceptual and semantic annotation. And
here is a sample output of the above program.

5.5- MAKKI AND MADANI CLASSIFICATION USING WEKA
After experimenting with basic frequency distributions, and after gaining access to a tag corpus, I
wanted to experiment with machine learning algorithms. The problem I chose is learning classifiers to
distinguish between Makki and Madani chapters. The main challenge here is to choose the attribute
set such that their number is optimal and at the same time considered good distinguishing criteria.
From the empirical statistics found in the previous section, I can suggest few attributes like most
frequent keywords found only in Makki or Madani category. However, suggesting attributes based on
empirical findings comes at a second level after exploring domain knowledge. Hence, I researched
works of early Qur'anic scholars on this matter. Good source of information can be found in (As-
Soyouti 1987) and (As-Sabt 1996) as well as in http://www.qurancomplex.com/ .These scholars did
suggest a number of distinguishing features of Makki and Madani chapters, which confirm my
empirical findings. Based on my experiments and these scholarly comments, I came up with the
following list of attributes summarized in the table below .

Table 5.14 – Attribute Set to learn classifiers for Makki and Madani Chapters
Following is a discussion justifying the selection and classification of these attributes.
The first attribute –i.e., Prostration- is an act of worship in Islam that involves placing the most
honourable part of once body –i.e., the forehead- on the ground as a symbol of submission to one
God. The people of Makkah used to refuse performing this humiliating act, and hence Makka chapters
repeatedly urge the Meccan to submit fully to Allah through prostration. Following is a sample verse
The Qur'an Annotation for Text Mining
43 Abdul-Baquee Sharaf- Transfer Report
from 25:60 "And when it is said to them, "Prostrate to the Most Merciful," they say, "And what is the
Most Merciful? Should we prostrate to that which you order us?" And it increases them in aversion."
Verses were searched for root word ROOT:sjd which captures various inflectional forms of this verb.
The second attribute is based on our empirical observation –supported by scholarly observation as
well- where the aversion particle "kal~a" meaning 'never' or 'no' is used only in Makki chapters, like
the following verse 70:39: "Never! Indeed, We have created them from that which they know." This
particle is used in the dialogue with people of Mecca arguing over their denial of submission to God
and their denial of the day of Judgement.
The third attributes are not exclusively dedicated to Makka or Median, but it is based on majority of
cases where the vocative expression "O mankind" followed by some message is more often a feature
in Makka chapters –but also mentioned in few Medina chapters like in 2:21- when most of the people
were not yet believers. Here is an example from 10:57 " O mankind, there has to come to you
instruction from your Lord and healing for what is in the breasts and guidance and mercy for the
believers."
However, later in Medina, the Muslim population grew and Qur'an started to address them starting
with the expression in the fourth attribute: "O you who believe!" which appears only in Medina
chapters. Here is an example of such a verse 61:10: "O you who have believed, shall I guide you to a
transaction that will save you from a painful punishment?"
There are 29 chapters initialized with letters, which are tagged as INL in the QAC. All except chapters 2
and 3 are Makki. We consider this as our fifth attribute. Here is an example from 3:1-2 " Alif, Lam,
Meem. Allah - there is no deity except Him, the Ever-Living, the Sustainer of existence."
The sixth attribute is based on stories of previous prophets and messengers mentioned in the Qur'an
like for example story of Moses, Abraham, Noah, etc. According to scholars, these stories in the
Qur'an server two purposes: first, a warning to the people of Makka that if they reject Prophet
Muhammad some punishment will befall on them as it happened to previous people who rejected
their messenger like Noah, Moses, etc. Second, these stories add motivation and steadfastness to
Prophet Muhammad who often gets frustrated when people of Makkah continue to deny his
message. In both cases, the subject is highly related to Makkah and hence this could be a good target
of attribute. Chapter 2 –which is Madani- is an exception where stories of Moses and Abraham were
mentioned, but in all other instances these stories always occur in Makki chapters. See for example
41:13 warning people of Makkah: "But if they turn away, then say, "I have warned you of a
thunderbolt like the thunderbolt [that struck] 'Aad and Thamud." In my search, I included a number of
prophets names which are mentioned in the Qur'an except Prophet Muhammad.
The seventh attribute is about a special story, which is the story of creation when Adam was created
and Allah ordered angels to prostrate to Adam, all submitted except Iblis (Satan) refused. This story
was mentioned only five times and our search produced a Boolean YES, NO when both names (Adam
and Iblis) are mentioned in the chapter. These instances were all Makki again except chapter 2 which
is Madani.
The eighth attribute is based on the rhetorical style of Makki chapters where language of certainty,
surprise, exhortation, aversion, emphasis is used in the course of arguments with the people of
Makkah. The QAC tags certain particles with 'emphasis', 'certainty', 'surprise', 'aversion', 'emphasis',
and I exploited this feature in counting for this attribute. Hence, my results are drawn totally on usage
of these particles, but later when semantic roles will be annotated the results would be more
accurate. Following table gives example verses of these particles.

Table 5.15 – Example verses of certainly and emphasis particles in the Qur’an
The ninth attribute is straightforward and deals with average length of a verse in terms of words.
Makkah verses are shorter than Medina verses which tends to be long when discussing legislations
and rulings.
The tenth attribute is counting the reference to some unseen facts and events from the world
hereafter which the people of Makkah used to deny and hence Makki chapters repeatedly
emphasized on them. Search was made on few concepts like Hellfire –and some alternative names of
hellfire in the Qur'an, punishment, paradise and the word "aAxirap" meaning hereafter.
Military conflict with the people of Makkah happened in Islamic history only after the migration of
Prophet Muhammad to Medinah, and hence our eleventh attribute on "jihad" in its 'fighting' sense
appears only in Medina chapters. Searching for this attribute was done through the root word of 'qtl'
meaning 'to fight' and 'jhd' meaning to 'struggle'. This is a near approximation as some reference to
struggle by earlier prophets might wrongly be included, nevertheless this gives a close estimation.
The twelfth attribute is about the concept of family legislations like marriage, divorce, pregnancy,
breast feeding, etc. These details are only mentioned in Medina chapters. Our search included root
word for 'marriage' and 'divorce', also we included the lemma 'wife' and 'women'. The latter two
lemmas would bring in some false positives where 'zawoj' is used to mean a 'pair' of anything like the
word 'mates' in 51:49 which is a Makki chapter: "And of all things We created two mates; perhaps
you will remember."
Attribute number 13 searches for reference to other divine religions mainly Jews and Christians. It is
only when Prophet Muhammad migrated to Medina he encountered with Jew tribes who used to live
in Medina, and later some Christian delegates came to Medina to debate on the nature of Jesus.
However, reference to Jesus is made in a number of Makki chapters, and this is why in my search I
included only terms: 'children of Israel', 'Torah', 'Gospel', 'Jew' and 'Christian'.
Apart from the first pillar of Islam all the other four (i.e., prayer, fasting, zakat and Hajj) were all
obligated in Medina period. Hence, I searched for lemma on these four pillars. Again there could be
false positives like the following Makki verse 19:55 referring to Prophet Ishmael: "And he used to
enjoin on his people prayer and zakah and was to his Lord pleasing."
After designing this attribute set, a spreadsheet is populated with these data and converted into weka
‘arff’ file. Following is a snapshot of the ‘arff’ file.

It is noted that most Makki chapters are short and often show no occurrence of the attribute
resulting is many ‘zero’ values. To overcome this problem, I normalized the data by adding one and
dividing the absolute count by total number of words for that chapter. With that I produced another
normalized model. Here are the attribute plots after normalization.

From this experimentation we can note the following observations and areas of improvement, which
will be carried out in my next year research:
1. Richer annotation of the Qur’an is likely to produce better results. As noted we only
leveraged on keywords, morphological and POS features in classifying between Makki and
Madani. Any ontological or semantic annotation would have produced much better results.
2. Machine learning algorithms produced interesting empirical findings that would interest
Qur’anic scholars, for example from figure 5.7, we came to know that verses in Makki surah’s
are 18 words in average.
3. The convenient visualization in Weka enables quick validation of certain observations made
by early scholars, for example figure 5.5 shows that there are Madani chapters (red) that
The Qur'an Annotation for Text Mining
50 Chapter 5 – Computational Experiments | FIRST YEAR TRANSFER REPORT
contain the construct “O Mankind”, and this refute claims by some scholars that this
construct appears only in Makki chapters.
4. This experiment showed which attributes are likely to help learning classifiers, for example,
only 4 attributes among the 15 were chosen by our classifiers: believer, emphasis,
averageLength and initials.
5. This experiment can be further improved by considering verses instead of chapters. This
would result in defining 6240 lines of data. The obvious problem will be the abundant ‘zero’
values for certain attributes.
6. Although this experiment showed success in machine learning for classifying Makki and
Madani verses, other text mining problems could be modelled similarly, for example, finding
verses that are similar, and finding associations and patterns. This experiment acted as a
feasibility study which will further be verified in the pilot project.

CHAPTER 6 – CONCLUSION
This report gave detailed account on my research work so far and my plan in future. I believe my
research topic of text mining the Qur'an is novel and would benefit a wide range of audience. There is
a huge potential in researching this area, and my research will contribute towards the growing field of
Arabic NLP and Arabic corpus linguistics. This project’s key contribution is in building the appropriate
resources for text mining the Qur’an. This project is motivated by the increasing interest on our target
text (i.e., the Qur’an), and the lack of resources and researches in this field, added to it the availability
of many scholarly commentaries on the Qur’an makes it easier to develop annotation guidelines and
resolve conflicts.
In what follows I would like to rate myself against the eight evaluation criteria in the assessment form.
Research Focus: Focusing my project towards the Qur'an is sensible for two reasons: first because of a
wide interest in this text, and second, because of its comparatively small size annotation works would
be feasible within a PhD timeline. The acceptance of a work-in-progress paper in the Corpus
Linguistics conference-2009 with high rating is an initial sign of interest in this research. This project is
first of its kind in the extent computational methods are used to investigate the Qur’an. This work
should motivate future research on many other related areas. Based on these, I believe I should score
1 on this criterion.
Research Methodology: I have divided the project into a pilot annotation considering chapters 2 and
7 from which I will consider the most interesting features in annotating the entire Qur'an. I have
adopted the CRISP-DM methodology of data mining in my research steps, and developed a realistic
plan. This industry standard methodology is likely to keep the project in track. I have identified areas
where text mining differs from data mining and made appropriate amendments to CRISP-DM to cater
for such changes. Given these, I believe my research methodology is well-defines, appropriate and
justified and hence should score 1 as well.
Originality: Apart from few papers discussed in chapter 2 which employs computational empirical
methods in distinguishing between Makki and Madani chapters, I could not locate academic
researches on multi-level annotation for text mining the Qur’an. I believe thus this is the first attempt
of its kind considering Qur’an as the domain, and hence would deserve scoring 1 against this criterion.
Progress: I have demonstrated my competency in applying computational and machine learning tools
to my domain (Chapter 5). I have demonstrated how a POS tagged corpus improved the results over
the raw text, and it is the intention of this project to improve results further through added layers of
annotation. I have managed to successfully publish work-in-progress paper on my research and
present it in front of experts in this field.
Myself as a researcher, I feel very comfortable with the domain (i.e., the Qur'an) being an expert in
classical Arabic language and the content of the Qur'an as well as scholarly comments. Moreover, I
have memorized the Qur'an by heart from my early childhood, and hence can recall easily the verses
under investigation. Also, my six years experience in industry as a software quality assurance officer
will also speak in favour of producing methodology based quality output. during the past six months,
my focus changed where initially I considered developing FrameNet type of role labelling, then
considered studying the ‘particles and prepositions’, and then considered ‘QA system’, before arriving
to the present scope detailed in this report. Overall I think I should score between ‘1’ and ‘2’ here.
Literature Review: I have investigated a wide range of literature both considering the Arabic sources
on the Qur’an, Quranic science and Tafsir, as well as current trends and achievements in the field of
The Qur'an Annotation for Text Mining
52 Chapter 6 – Conclusion | FIRST YEAR TRANSFER REPORT
text mining. I became acquainted with domain specific works on biological and medical text mining, as
well as computational stylistics of literature, and I have discussed how advancement in these fields
can benefit my research on Qur’anic annotation and text mining. In total I have included more than 80
citations. I should score ‘1’ against this criterion.
Report – Work Done: Chapters 4 and 5 are dedicated on reporting my work done so far. I have kept a
copy of the CL2009 paper and the submitted abstract of LREC2010 in the appendix. I obtained a copy
of the Arabic Quranic Corpus lately when it was recently released, and had it been available earlier,
more computational work would have been possible to demonstrate. Here, I believe I should score
‘1’.
Report – Research Plan: Chapter 3 gives a detailed description of my research plan. I have included a
Gantt chart and considered various opportunities of publishing my work. I described the project
according to the phases of the CRISP-DM methodology. To be realistic I considered a pilot annotation
of the Qur’anic considering only chapters 2 and 7. I believe my plan is credible and realistic, and hence
would deserve score ‘1’.
Training Requirements: I have included in Chapter 4 a list of courses I joined. My annotation work on
Arabic discourse Treebank (under Katja Markert and Amal As-Saif) contributes towards my training
needs. I could see still opportunities of improvement especially in mathematical and statistical
background for machine learning, as well as some GUI programming under Java in case I need to build
annotation tools. I think I should score ‘2’ under this criterion.

APPENDIX 1 – LREC 2010 ABSTRACT
TOWARDS AN EFFICIENT QA SYSTEM ON THE QUR’AN THROUGH MULTI-LAYERED ANNOTATION
Abdul-Baquee M. Sharaf Eric S. Atwell
University of Leeds, UK
{scsams,scs6ea@leeds.ac.uk}
The Qur’an is believed to be the words of God and supposed to be a source of valuable
information not only for a growing 1.5 billion Muslims worldwide, but also for the whole
mankind. The Qur’an consists of 114 chapters with approximately 77 thousand words of
classical Arabic.
The Qur’an covers a wide range of topics from description of God's attributes and qualities,
to information about past historic events, to laws and legislations for Muslims, to
information about future events. Thus, the Qur’an contains narrative information as well
as commands and imperative statements. It was compiled over 23 years of the lifetime of
the prophet Muhammad. This book is divided into varying size chapters each consists of
varying size verses. Although, a particular chapter covers a unifying theme, its verses
often cover a wide range of topics, which mostly correlates with related verses from
different chapters. This feature of related concepts scattered within many chapters makes
it a laborious human task when attempting to collect all these verses in search of a
complete concept, hence, an interesting task for computational analysis.
The Qur’an was revealed on the Prophet Muhammad who in turn used to explain these
verses and show to Muslims the details of generalities that was left unexplained in the
Qur’an. For example, the Qur’an only commands to perform prayer, fasting, pilgrimage and
so on, but the details of how, when and where to perform these obligatory are left for the
Prophet to explain. Prophetic sayings are called Hadith. Moreover, the rulings and
legislations within the Qur’an were gradually completed to its final shape. Thus, a later
verse might come to abrogate the ruling set by an earlier verse.
All these issues and contexts need to be taken into account in order to properly understand
the Qur’anic texts. Thus, when intending to understand a particular verse, all related
verses need to be first consulted, then all sayings of the Prophet on any of these verses
need to be referenced, along with comments of Qur’anic scholars, especially the students
of the Prophet. Finally, since the Qur’an is a classical Arabic text, traditional Arabic
grammar and lexicon can be helpful as well. Islamic traditional library contains many books
on Qur’anic exegesis which give this kind of elaborate analysis for each verse of the Qur’an.
These volumes are known as books of Tafsir. Famous traditional books include [At-Tabari
2000; IbnKatheer 1999 and Al-Baghawi 1997]. Extensive analysis of these books of Tafsir
reveals a set of general rules for interpreting the Qur’an, which we will refer to as Rules of
The Qur'an Annotation for Text Mining
60
Tafsir. One such rule specifies that any verse which addresses the Prophet Muhammad
equally addresses the general Muslim community unless explicitly mentioned otherwise.
In this project, work is in progress to build a specialized multi
for the purpose of knowledge extraction and question answering. This annotation scheme
is able to structure the information in Tafsir Ibn Katheer and link each verse with
verses, Hadith and scholarly comments. In order to enable computational tasks, in addition
to these three specialized Tafsir layers, some more NLP layers are created. This includes:
part-of-speech, syntactic parsing, FrameNet semantic role labelin
resolution, anaphora resolution, and discourse relations. In the process of automatic
knowledge extraction and question answering, this multi

of Tafsir. Figure 1 depicts these annotation layers and the static knowledge bases.

61 Abdul-Baquee Sharaf- Transfer Report
This research project is motivated by the fact that the Qur’an is a popular book and a
source of guidance for over 1.5 billion Muslims worldwide, added to the fact that no
systems exist today for knowledge extraction from the Qur’an –to the best of our
knowledge- that harness the computational power, apart from online keyword (and root
word) searches. See for example online Qur’an search at [
http://www.islamicity.com/QuranSearch/ ] and [ http://Quran.muslim-web.com ].
Annotation guidelines for most of our NLP layers are adopted -with some customization-
from publicly available resources or schemes. For morphological and POS tagged layer,
there are to our knowledge two resources available: the Haifa corpus (Dror et al 2004) and
the CRESENT corpus [Dukes and Habash 2010a] which we intend to use and is available at
(http://www.Qur’an.uk.net ). For syntactic parsing layer, we will adopt a dependency
based parsing scheme incorporating traditional Arabic grammar rules described in [Dukes et
al 2010b] and partially available at [http://Quran.uk.net/Treebank.aspx ]. The semantic
parsing layer is constructed using the annotation guideline of the FrameNet [Ruppenhofer
et al 2005] which also resulted in annotating the German TIGER corpus [Burchardt et al
2009] and influenced designing a semantic annotation model for the Qur’an as described in
[Sharaf and Atwell 2009]. For constructing the discourse layer we follow the guidelines in
the Penn Discourse Treebank manual (Prasad et al 2008) and available at [
http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~pdtb/PDTBAPI/pdtb-annotation-manual.pdf] and the explicit
Modern Standard Arabic discourse annotation guideline developed at the University of Leeds
[Alsaif and Markert 2009]. For anaphora resolution, we adopt the XML-based scheme
described by (Tutin et al 2000) that includes coreference, set membership, substitution,
sentential anaphora and indefinite relations. Rules of Tafsir have been addressed in many
Arabic literatures, and in this research we adopt such rules from [As-Sabt 1996], which
contains along with Tafsir rules, those rules dictated by Arabic grammar and the linguistic
styles of classical Arabs. Arabic lexicon will be constructed using existing Arabic WordNet
lexicon [Elkateb et al 2006] also available online at [ http://www.globalwordnet.org/AWN/
], and by incorporating some traditional works on Qur’anic vocabulary like [Ad-Dinawry
1978].
The annotation will be carried out through in-house developed tool, which incorporates
machine readable text of the Qur’an and Tafsir of Ibn Katheer, and creates XML
representation for each layer indicating the index location of the intended annotated
arguments. In order to facilitate annotation, annotation scheme will be produced along
with DTD description for each layer.
Having this multi-layered corpus in place, an efficient framework for information extraction
and question answering can be built. The characteristics of the Qur’an portraying a network
of verses sharing similar concept can be leveraged, and if only one verse can be identified
from user question or input, then this verse can be considered as a seed verse that can
bootstrap through "related verses" layer and bring in a network of other verses along with
all Hadith and scholarly comments on these verses. Fig 2 depicts such a network of a
concept generated from a single verse. In this manner, a single verse immediately leads to
a network of verses, Hadith and scholarly comments thanks to the pre-annotated layers of
related verses, Hadith and scholarly comments in our scheme taken from Tafsir Ibn
Katheer.

Abstract
In this paper, we present our in-progress research tasks for building lexical database of the
verb valences in the Arabic Quran using FrameNet frames. We study the verbs in their context
in the Quran, and compare that with matching frames and frame evoking verbs in the English
FrameNet. We analyze the gaps and make appropriate amendments to the FrameNet by
adding new frame elements and relations.
1. Introduction
The Quran is the central religious text of Islam – the world's second largest religion
with a growing population of over 1.5 billion Muslims (1). Muslims believe that the
Quran contains the words of God revealed on Prophet Muhammad by the Angel
Gabriel (2); and that it is free from contradictions or discrepancies (3).
While there has been research in Arabic corpus linguistics (Atwell et al 2008)
(Al-Sulaiti & Atwell 2006), or keyword search tools for the Quran (4), to our
knowledge no extensive work has been done towards Quranic Corpus Linguistics.
The goal of this work-in-progress research is to design a Knowledge Representation
(KR) model for the Quran leveraging on the concept of ‘frame semantics’ as
introduced by Fillmore (Fillmore 1978). Based on the concept of frame semantics,
researchers in International Computer Science Institute (ICSI), Berkeley, started the
FrameNet project (Ruppenhofer et al 2005) (Baker et al 1998) (Fillmore et al 2003) in
1997 to build an online lexicon for English frames which are to capture the semantic
The Qur'an Annotation for Text Mining
66 | FIRST YEAR TRANSFER REPORT
and syntactic properties of English predicates based on their usage in the British
National Corpus (BNC) (Aston & Burnard 1998). Based on the experience of the
English FrameNet, various projects started to build similar lexicon for other
languages.
In our research project, we aim to build a FrameNet like lexicon for the verbs
in the Arabic Quran. This initial attempt will enable future extension to include
predicates other than verbs and to consider other classical Arabic texts as well as
Modern Standard Arabic.
This paper is laid out as follows: Section 2 gives background information on
Arabic verbs and some linguistic style of the Quran. Section 3 gives a sketch of
related works on Quranic and Arabic verbs. Section 4 gives background information
on the FrameNet lexicon. Section 4 details our intended research task and the
challenges towards its implementation. Section 5 describes Framenet integration
projects for other languages. Section 6 reports on the main tasks and challenges of
this project. Finally we conclude highlighting the novelty of our research and its
expected benefits.
2. Backgrounds
2.1 Arabic Verbs
In general, classical Arabic follows Verb-Subject-Object (VSO) order. The majority
of Arabic verbs are trilateral, which can be derived to 15 different forms. Each
derivation signifies some semantic variations over the original form. Table 1 gives a
brief account on the most frequent nine such forms with their semantic significance.
(Wright 1996) provides more elaborate discussion. The semantic significance of each
derivation form is a subtle aspect of Arabic grammar which has no direct equivalent
in the grammar/morphology of English or European languages.

2.2 The Quranic Linguistic Style
According to Muslims, the Quran is divine and contains words of God. It was
revealed over a period of 23 years to the Prophet Mohammad in Arabic language. It
contains around 78,000 words within the 114 chapters. The central topic of the Quran
is to establish the monotheistic creed of God being the only possessor of divine power
and only being who deserves to be worshiped. Prophet Muhammad challenged the
Arabs to find another text –or a chapter of a text- like the Quran (5). The Quran
claims to contain the fairest of statements and a scripture able to raise emotions and
sentiments (6).
Following are some of the characteristics of the linguistic styles in the Quran.
These features should pose special interests and challenges for computational
linguistics solutions.
The Qur'an Annotation for Text Mining
68 | FIRST YEAR TRANSFER REPORT
2.2.1 Scattered information on a same topic
The Quran often talks about a topic scattered within many different verses in different
chapters. Consider the following verses (7):
[1] Show us the straight path, The path of those whom Thou hast favoured [1:6,7]
[2] Whoso obeyeth Allah and the messenger, they are with those unto whom Allah
has shown favour, of the prophets and the saints and the martyrs and the
righteous [4:69]
[3] He who holdeth fast to Allah, he indeed is guided unto a right path [2:101]
In [1] there is a reference to a ‘straight/right path’ and a reference to a
category of people whom God has favoured without highlighting who might be in this
category. Verse [2] which is in a different chapter gives four types of people whom
God shown favour. In [3], which is again in a different chapter, expands this list of
favoured category to include one more.
The Quran also repeats a certain story, for example, of a previous prophet in
many chapters but each occurrence adds certain information not present in other
occurrences. For example, the Quran tells various aspects of the story of Moses in 132
places distributed among 20 chapters. This feature of the Quran makes a good case for
computational solutions towards bringing these scattered occurrences automatically in
one thread.
2.2.2 Literal vs. technical sense of a word
The Quran borrows an Arabic word and specializes it to indicate a technical term.
Consider for example the word jannah/َجّنة  meaning literally ‘a garden’, but -as a
technical term- in the Quran whenever this word is used it refers to ‘the paradise’
where the believers will abode as reward after the Day of Judgment. However, there
are few instances where this word is used in the literal meaning to refer to certain
gardens in this world. In the following examples [4] uses the more frequent technical
sense and [5] uses the less frequent literal meaning.
[4] And vie one with another for forgiveness from your Lord, and for a paradise
as wide as are the heavens and the earth, prepared for those who ward off
(evil); [3:133]
[5] There was indeed a sign for Sheba in their dwelling-place: Two gardens on the
right hand and the left..[34:15]
The Qur'an Annotation for Text Mining
69 Abdul-Baquee Sharaf- Transfer Report
2.2.3 Grammatical shift
The Quran often draws the attention of the reader by shifting grammatical agreement
in a statement. For example, in [6] the mode changed from ‘you’ to ‘they’ and ‘them’
moving from 2nd person to third person. In [7] the verse shifted from addressing the
Prophet alone to addressing the group.
[6] when ye are in the ships and they sail with them with a fair breeze [3:133]
[7] O Prophet! When ye (men) put away women..[65:1]
2.2.4 Verbs associating with different preposition
The Quran exhibits many examples where a certain verb is associated with a
preposition which is unusual with this verb, but common with a different verb.
Consider [8a] and [8b] below, the Arabic verbs khala/خال means be alone, which is
usually followed by the preposition ‘with’ like ‘John was alone with Mary’. However,
in this verse the Quran choose to use the preposition ‘to’ with ‘be alone’ which
sounds unusual to say, ‘John was alone to Mary’. However, this is a valid classical
Arabic style when a verb borrows a preposition that binds with another verb and uses
it to indicate at the same time meaning of both verbs. The Arabic verb dhahaba/ذھب
(go) fits well with the preposition ‘to’ as in: ‘John went to Mary’. So, in this verse, the
Quran by using a verb (be alone) with a preposition (to) from another verb ‘go’
conveyed the meaning of ‘being alone and going to’ at the same time. This unique
characteristic made both translations in [8a] and [8b] partially true, highlighting either
the sense of the original verb ‘be alone with’ as in [8a] or the implicit verb with
explicit preposition ‘go to’ as in [8b]. See Ibn-Katheer (2006) on his commentary of
this verse.
[8a] When they meet those who believe, they say: "We believe;" but when they are
alone with their evil ones, they say: "We are really with you: We (were) only
jesting." [2:14 Yusuf Ali Translation]
[8b] And when they fall in with those who believe, they say: We believe; but when
they go apart to their devils they declare: Lo! we are with you; verily we did
but mock. [2:14 Pickthal Translation]
2.2.5 Metaphors and Figurative
The Quran uses a lot of metaphors and figurative language. In [9] Pickthal used the
verb ‘shine’ but the Arabic verb /ishtala means ‘to flare’ and shows the analogy of
‘old age symptom by many gray hair’ with a ‘fire burning a bush’. In [10] the Muslim
army was so frightened that it felt as if their hearts reached to the throats.
,
The Qur'an Annotation for Text Mining
70 | FIRST YEAR TRANSFER REPORT
[9] My Lord! Lo! the bones of me wax feeble and my head is shining with grey
hair..[19:4]
[10] When they came upon you from above you and from below you, and when eyes
grew wild and hearts reached to the throats [33:10]
2.2.6 Metonymy
In many verses the Quran uses metonymy. In [11] the Arabic verse literally means
‘ask the town’ which means (and was translated so) ‘ask the people who live in the
town’. In [12] ‘a thing of planks and nails’ is the ‘Noah’s ark’, and in [13] ‘eating
food’ metonymically means the ‘need to answer call of nature’, see Ibn-Katheer
(2006) commenting on this verse.
[11] Ask the township where we were, and the caravan with which we travelled
hither. [12:82]
[12] And We carried him upon a thing of planks and nails [54:13]
[13] The Messiah, son of Mary, was no other than a messenger, messengers (the
like of whom) had passed away before him. And his mother was a saintly
woman. And they both used to eat (earthly) food [5:75]
2.2.7 Imperative vs. non-Imperatives
Arabic verbs are classified into past, present and imperative. Thus, in Arabic the
imperative structure can be understood from the type of the verb used. However, in
the Quran, although this general rule applies, yet there are many instances where
imperative is understood although no imperative verb is used, for example in [14].
The opposite is also true: there are instances where an imperative verb is used, but the
verse indicates non-imperative sense, for example [15] where the translator explicitly
indicated the non-imperative meaning within brackets.
[14] and whoever is minded to perform the pilgrimage therein there is no lewdness
nor abuse nor angry conversation on the pilgrimage. [2:197]
[15] O ye who believe! Profane not Allah's monuments nor the Sacred Month nor
the offerings nor the garlands, nor those repairing to the Sacred House,
seeking the grace and pleasure of their Lord. But when ye have left the sacred
territory, then go hunting (if ye will). [5:2]
3. Related work
(Bielicky and Smarz 2008) describes building a valency lexicon for modern standard
Arabic from the Prague Arabic Dependency Treeback (PADT). Their work is built on
‘Functional Generative Description (FGD)’ theory where verbs have valency frame
with many complements known as functors which can further be divided into actants
The Qur'an Annotation for Text Mining
71 Abdul-Baquee Sharaf- Transfer Report
(Actor, Addressee, Patient, Effect and Origin) and adjuncts (like Manner , Means and
Location). This FGD concept was adapted for Arabic verbs and various corpus
examples were drawn to prove the applicability of FGD for capturing Arabic verb
valency. Some cases needed special attention like: diathesis, passive verbs, reflexivity
and verb nominals.
(Al-Qahtani 2005) gives an extensive categorization of modern standard
Arabic verb valence based on Case Grammar (CG) as described by (Fillmore 1968).
Based on the assumption that CG is adequate to classify all verbs of a language and is
universal across languages, Al-Qahtani went on to specify valence according to
Cook’s Matrix Model (Cook 1979) and its extension that includes 24 cells. According
to this matrix five cases (Agent, Experiencer, Benefactive, Object, Locative) are
plotted horizontally and type of verb (State, Process, Action) vertically. The date was
taken from 8327 verbs from a lexicon (Al-Qahtani 2003) and most frequent 200 verbs
were exhaustively sorted to a cell in the matrix, and thus proved the suitability of
Cook’s model for Arabic valence.
(Fiteih 1983) studied the prepositional verbs considering the Quran as his
corpus. He could classify four classes of Quranic verbs based on the number and type
of nominals and prepositions these verbs allow. There are cases when a verb allows
one prepositional object (e.g., reach to something as in [16]), or a nominal and a
prepositional object (e.g., send against someone something as in [17]), or two
prepositional objects (e.g., come forth unto someone from some place as in [18]), or
one nominal object and two prepositional objects [19a] or one prepositional object
and two nominal objects [19b].
[16] And when he saw their hands reached not to it, he mistrusted them.. [11:70]
[17] For We sent against them a furious wind, [54:19 Yusuf Ali Translation]
[18] Then he came forth unto his people from the sanctuary [19:11]
[19] a. And Allah hath favoured some of you above others in provision [16:71]
b. He hath bestowed on those who strive a great reward above the
sedentary[4:95]
Shamsan (Shamsan 1986) studies the transitivity and intransitivity of Quranic
verbs. He analyzed the valences of these verbs and tried to link between the form of
these verbs and the semantic significance. He also observed the shift of a verb from
intransitive to transitive sense based on semantic characteristics.
(Mir 1989) observed that quite a lot verbs in the Quran are used in idiomatic
sense rather than literal meaning of the verb. He went on to list such expressions in
the Quran. Some examples are given in the following quote.
When a man’s “eyes become cool”, it means that he is pleased. A person who “brings down
his wing” for you is being kind to you, but if he “bites his fingers” at you, he holds you a
The Qur'an Annotation for Text Mining

severe grudge. If you think you lack the gift of fluent speech, you can pray to God to “untie
the knot in your tongue” (Mir 1989: 2-3)
4. FrameNet Lexicon
FrameNet is a lexicon that describes ‘Frames’ as a schematic representation
describing a situation involving various conceptual roles called ‘Frame Elements
(FE)’. A frame can be ‘evoked’ by a group of related predicates (mainly verbs, but
also nouns or adjectives) called ‘Lexical Units (LU)’.
For example, the verb ‘buy’ along with ‘purchase’ form the LUs that can
evoke the commerce_buy frame. This frame has ‘core’ – frame elements that are
essential to the meaning of the frame- FEs (BUYER, GOODS) and has many other
non-core FEs (like: DURATION, MANNER, MEANS, MONEY, PLACE,
PURPOSE, RATE, REASON, RECIPIENT, SELLER, TIME, UNIT).
Following are some illustrative examples from commerce_buy frame
description. (The lexical unit is in boldface and Frame Elements are in CAPITALS).
[20] [BUYER Lee] BOUGHT [GOODS a textbook] [SELLER from Abby]
[21] Will they allow [BUYER you] to PURCHASE [MEANS by check?]
[22] [BUYER Sam] BOUGHT [GOODS the car] [MONEY for $12,000].
[23] [BUYER You] BOUGHT [RECIPIENT me] [GOODS three pairs] already!
Currently, the FrameNet project contains more than 10,000 lexical units in
nearly 800 hierarchically related semantic frames, exemplified in more than 135,000
annotated sentences. (Ruppenhofer et al 2005).
In addition to frame description, FrameNet also specifies frame-to-frame
relations. These relations include: inheritance, subframe, causative_of, inchoative_of
and using. For example, in figure 1, the frame commerce_buy inherits from more
general getting frame, and is inherited by more specific renting frame, and is used by
two related frames, namely, importing and shopping.
The Qur'an Annotation for Text Mining
73
Figure 1.
FrameNet also provides annotated sentences. This can be of two types:
lexicographically motivated annotation and full
focus is to record the range of semantic and syntactic combinatory possibilities of a
target lexical unit. Annotation of running text, on the other hand intends to
exhaustively annotate each word in the text, which is possible thanks to layering
techniques. The main layers are: a) Frame Element (FE) specifying frame elements as
depicted in example [16] to [19], b) grammatical function (GF) like subject, object,
etc., c) phrase type (PT) like noun phrase, verb phrase, etc and d) part
(POS).
Natural texts in many cases do not show up many conceptual frame elements.
For this reason FrameNet annotation kept provision for ‘Null Instantiation’ (NI). This
omission can be understood from the context and is called ‘Definite Null Instantiation
(DNI) like the missing RECIPIENT in [20] or cannot be retrieved but whose type is
known like the missing QUARREL sense in [21], or the omission is allowed by the
grammar of the sentence like the missing subject in any imperative structure like in
[22].

Since the release of the English FrameNet, researchers started similar projects in other
languages. Successful examples are German, Spanish and Japanese.
5.1 German SALSA project
The German FrameNet project known as SALSA (Burchardt et al 2009) builds on the
assumption that the English FrameNet is based on coarse-grained semantic classes
which describes prototypical situations and thus, can be applied to other languages.
During the course of the project, the team have found high correlation between
English and German frames. However, they encountered some problems related to
non-existence of certain language constructions in English (like some use of datives)
and lexicalization differences in certain semantic domains (such as movement). The
team went on to exhaustively annotate a large scale German corpus – the TIGER
treebank (Bransts et al. 2002) – and in the process they had to encounter issues which
were not faced by the FrameNet team, like dealing with idioms, support verb
constructions, and metaphors. Idioms are multiword fixed expressions, and hence, the
team decided to consider the whole expression as a frame-evoking word. In support
verb constructions, the verb only supports a head noun (like ‘give lecture’) where the
‘lecturing’ frame should evoked instead of a ‘giving’ frame. The SALSA team in this
case annotated the verbal part with a pseudo frame ‘Support’ with the noun as
SUPPORTED frame element. In case of metaphors, in order to understand the literal
source meaning should be transferred to the target intended meaning. The SALSA
teams decided to annotate such cases with two frames: one for the target and one for
the source.
As FrameNet is still under development, the team had to encounter non-
existence of certain lemma senses in the English FrameNet. In these cases, they
created proto-frames which define a new Frame following the style of the English
FrameNet, and are also included in the frame-to-frame relationships.
The annotation is done using home-made SALTO tool that extends the TIGER
syntactic tree to include Frame description. Unlike FrameNet, SALSA annotates
frames with only ‘core’ frame elements.
5.2 Spanish FrameNet
Spanish FrameNet (Subirats & Petruck 2003) uses the English FrameNet lexicon to
build a Spanish lexical resource. The project built a subcorpus of sentences from a
300 million word Spanish corpus that contains texts from various genres. (Subirats &
Petruck 2003) report some difference in the lexicalization patterns of emotion
predicates between English and Spanish as follows:
The Qur'an Annotation for Text Mining
75 Abdul-Baquee Sharaf- Transfer Report
“While both languages lexicalize the causative meaning with a verb (sorprender and surprise)
and the stative meaning with an adjective (estar sorprendido and to be surprised),
Spanish lexicalizes the inchoative meaning in the reflexive verb sorprenderse - ‘to get
surprised’, while English uses a construction with get and the adjectival past participle
surprised. In addition, while English has just one lexical unit surprised in the
Experiencer_subject frame, Spanish has two: sorprendido used in conjunction with
estar as a stative; and sorprenderse which is inchoative.”
5.3 Japanese FrameNet
Japanese FrameNet (Ohara et al 2004) is a project started in 2002 based on English
FrameNet. It started with a pilot study of motion and communication verbs. Corpus
evidence is taken from the Mainichi newspaper corpus. The project team realized that
unlike English, Japanese specifies a path along with motion, and thus has verb for ‘go
across’ and another for ‘go beyond, go over’. Therefore, they suggest amending
Frame elements with BOUNDARY or ROUTE elements.
6. The Quranic FrameNet Project
6.1 Main Tasks
The first task is to collect all verbs in the Quran and their context in the verses. The
reason we chose to consider only verbs is: first, to start with a feasible scope, and
second, in Arabic –as well as other languages- verbs play the most vital predicate role.
Malise Ruthven explains further:
Substances and adjective are almost always verbal derivatives, usually participles or verbal
nouns. A clerk is a writer [katib], a book is a writ [kitab]. Aeroplanes and birds are thing that
fly [tiara and tayr]…it is precisely because Arabic refrains from classifying words into
discrete particles, but keeps them instead in a logical and balanced relationship with a central
concept. –the verbal root – that it becomes an eminently suitable language for religious
expression.” (Ruthven 1984:111)
This work of Quranic verbal analysis is being carried out through a machine
readable index of the Quran (Abdulbaqi 1955). Each verb will be classified into their
form (see verb forms in Table 1), which will help in semantic labeling later. Then,
each Quranic verb needs to be studied to find a matching FrameNet lexical unit. For
ambiguous cases, several parallel English translations will be consulted. Also, Books
of Tafsir (scholarly interpretation of the Quran) for example (Ibn-Katheer 2006) or
specialized lexicons and dictionaries (for example (Ibn-Mandhour 1997) or (Penrice
1873)) can be studied for clarification. Through this chosen lexical unit, the
The Qur'an Annotation for Text Mining
76 | FIRST YEAR TRANSFER REPORT
corresponding frame in FrameNet will then be studied for appropriateness. To check
this ‘appropriateness’, all target Quranic verb valences must exhibit the core frame
elements of the chosen frame.
As an example, consider the Ingestion frame as depicted in Table 2 below.
This frame has two core elements: ingestibles and an ingestor.
Frame
Name
Ingestion
Definitio
n
An Ingestor consumes food or drink (Ingestible), which entails putting the Ingestible in the
mouth for delivery to the digestive system. This may include the use of an Instrument.
Sentences that describe the provision of food to others are NOT included in this frame.
Core
Frame
Elements
Ingestibles The Ingestibles are the entities that are being consumed by the Ingestor.
Ingestor
(Sentient)
The Ingestor is the person eating or drinking.
Lexical
Units

gulp.n, gulp.v, guzzle.v, have.v, imbibe.v, ingest.v, lap.v, lunch.v, munch.v, nibble.v,

sup.v, swig.n, swig.v, swill.v, tuck.v
Table 2: FrameNet description of the frame: Ingestion
Next, consider the verb ‘eat’ in the Quran. It appeared –with derived forms-
100 times. Table 3 below lists a few representative concordance lines. In the majority
of the cases, its use was in alignment with FrameNet descriptions, like the example of
line [A]. However, there are examples where ‘eat’ is used differently, for example
lines [B] uses ‘eat’ to mean ‘eating money’ which is not a usual ingestible item, and
hence it means to ‘earn money unlawfully’. Consider also the line [E] where ‘seven
years’ are the ‘ingestor’ which violates the ‘sentient’ restriction of FrameNet.
A the sea to be of service that ye eat fresh meat from thence 16:14
B And eat not up your property among 2:188
C Would one of you love to eat the flesh of his dead brother? 49:12
D seven fat kine which seven lean were eating 12:43
E seven hard years which will devour all that ye have prepared for them 12:48
F they eat into their bellies nothing else than
fire
2:177
G Devoure
r
of unlawful 5:42
Table 3. Few KWIC lines for <eat> from the Quran
These Quranic usages mandate us to extend the FrameNet to capture these
non-ingestible and non-sentient uses. Thus, we suggest following the German SALSA
strategy of creating a proto-frame for this special sense of ‘eating money’.
The Qur'an Annotation for Text Mining
77 Abdul-Baquee Sharaf- Transfer Report
As indicated in the previous section, the Quran contains many instances of
verbal idioms. In such cases, again we follow the SALSA solution of considering the
whole multi-word idiom as a frame-evoking predicate. Similarly, in case of
metaphors, we intend to produce two annotations of such verses: one for the literal
meaning and another to represent the metaphorical intended meaning.
In addition to exhaustively annotating the subcorpus of verses containing
verbs in the Quran, we intend to choose as a case study, full-annotation of chapter 2
‘Surah al-Baqarah’ as a sample chapter from the Quran. This chapter portrays vibrant
use of verbs since 97.5% of its 286 verses contain verbs (Suleiman 1997). We will
carry on annotation in three layers, as is the FrameNet practice: Frame Elements
layer, Grammatical Function Layer and Phrase Type Layer. In order to annotate
Grammatical function, we will resort to reference books which exhaustively analyzed
the grammatical function of each verse of each chapter, for example (Salih 1998), and
populate the grammatical function layer. It should be noted that because of the
vocalized form of the Quranic text, many ambiguities that appear otherwise in modern
standard Arabic will not be faced. However, it is evident that many Quranic
expressions result in more than one valid syntactic –and semantic- tree. For example,
consider [27] which can refer simultaneously to two valid meanings [27a] and [27b]
depending on where to pause.
[27] This is the book no doubt in it a guidance for those conscious of Allah [2:2]
[27a] This is the book no doubt in it. It is guidance for those conscious of Allah.
[27b] This is the book no doubt. In it a guidance for those conscious of Allah.
6.2 Representation
To represent the frames and lexical units, we will adhere to the structure of the
FrameNet Database as detailed in (Baker et. al 2003). The result will be presented
online in the FrameNet style, where color highlighting will help distinguish various
frame elements.
6.3 Evaluation and Applications
The Qur'an Annotation for Text Mining
78 | FIRST YEAR TRANSFER REPORT
Our annotated Quran chapters should represent the following three verses which are
related semantically but scattered in various locations. Using FrameNet’s Giving
frame and extending it to capture the non-profit charitable sense of spend, the
following labeling can be made.
[28] and [they DONOR] spend out of [what We have provided for them THEME] [2:3]
[29] and they ask you what [they DONOR] should spend. Say, “[the excess DONATED_AMOUNT]”. [2:219]
[30] and they ask you what they should spend. Say, “Whatever [you DONOR] spend of [good
DONATED_AMOUNT] is [for parents and relatives and orphans and the needy and the traveler
RECIPIENT]. [2:215]
While [28] talks about the theme of the donated money, [29] qualifies the type
of this theme to be from the excess money that is left after spending on the necessary
needs. However, [30] gives an answer to the same question as in [29], but specifies
the recipient of this spend rather than the type or amount of the money.
Similarly, proceeding with annotation of the Quran governed by frame
semantics might reveal interesting findings which might not be captured in books of
Tafsir (scholarly interpretation of the Quran).
Annotating the Quran with frame semantics will facilitate efficient search
beyond the existing keyword search. A Quranic researcher will be able to search
semantic frames and semantic roles in addition to keywords.
Another interesting application of our semantically annotated corpus would be
a Question Answering system. A question can be normalized into FrameNet style
representation and matched with similar frames in the Quran for potential answers.
(Shen and Lapata 2007) showed that FrameNet annotation produces significant
improvement in QA systems.
6.3 Challenges
FrameNet is still under development. So for a certain lemma not all senses maybe
covered. Also, because FrameNet only uses lexicographical prototype examples, some
context usage might be hard to relate. Also, idioms and metaphors pose difficulty in
representation. The lack of Arabic NLP tools –as compared to English NLP tools-
might cause problems in automation and computational analysis.
7. Conclusions
We have embarked on a novel project towards frame semantics which starts
by developing FrameNet frames for Quranic verbs, but can be extended to include
The Qur'an Annotation for Text Mining
79 Abdul-Baquee Sharaf- Transfer Report
non-verbal predicated in the Quran and can further be extended to include predicates
in Modern Standard Arabic. To our knowledge no previous attempts has been made
towards integrating Arabic verbs to FrameNet frames.
Once completed, this research will benefit a wide audience. It will benefit
Arabic NLP researchers considering a full-fledged Arabic FrameNet. It will benefit
also the FrameNet community towards achieving a multi-lingual FrameNet project.
This research will serve the wide Muslim population for better searching and
extracting information from the Quran. In particular, the frame reports of Quranic
Verb will interest Arabic linguists is analyzing the valence of the Quranic verbs.
