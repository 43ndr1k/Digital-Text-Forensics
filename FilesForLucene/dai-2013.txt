This thesis presents new Bayesian nonparametric models and approaches for their de-
velopment, for the problems of name disambiguation and supervised learning. Bayesian
nonparametric methods form an increasingly popular approach for solving problems
that demand a high amount of model flexibility. However, this field is relatively new,
and there are many areas that need further investigation. Previous work on Bayesian
nonparametrics has neither fully explored the problems of entity disambiguation and
supervised learning nor the advantages of nested hierarchical models. Entity disambig-
uation is a widely encountered problem where different references need to be linked
to a real underlying entity. This problem is often unsupervised as there is no previ-
ously known information about the entities. Further to this, effective use of Bayesian
nonparametrics offer a new approach to tackling supervised problems, which are fre-
quently encountered.
The main original contribution of this thesis is a set of new structured Dirichlet pro-
cess mixture models for name disambiguation and supervised learning that can also
have a wide range of applications. These models use techniques from Bayesian stat-
istics, including hierarchical and nested Dirichlet processes, generalised linear models,
Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and optimisation techniques such as BFGS. The
new models have tangible advantages over existing methods in the field as shown with
experiments on real-world datasets including citation databases and classification and
regression datasets.
I develop the unsupervised author-topic space model for author disambiguation that
uses free-text to perform disambiguation unlike traditional author disambiguation ap-
proaches. The model incorporates a name variant model that is based on a nonparamet-
ric Dirichlet language model. The model handles both novel unseen name variants and
can model the unknown authors of the text of the documents. Through this, the model
can disambiguate authors with no prior knowledge of the number of true authors in the
dataset. In addition, it can do this when the authors have identical names.
I use a model for nesting Dirichlet processes named the hybrid NDP-HDP. This
model allows Dirichlet processes to be clustered together and adds an additional level of
structure to the hierarchical Dirichlet process. I also develop a new hierarchical exten-
sion to the hybrid NDP-HDP. I develop this model into the grouped author-topic model
for the entity disambiguation task. The grouped author-topic model uses clusters to
ii
model the co-occurrence of entities in documents, which can be interpreted as research
groups. Since this model does not require entities to be linked to specific words in a
document, it overcomes the problems of some existing author-topic models. The model
incorporates a new method for modelling name variants, so that domain-specific name
variant models can be used.
Lastly, I develop extensions to supervised latent Dirichlet allocation, a type of super-
vised topic model. The keyword-supervised LDA model predicts document responses
more accurately by modelling the effect of individual words and their contexts directly.
The supervised HDP model has more model flexibility by using Bayesian nonparamet-
rics for supervised learning. These models are evaluated on a number of classification
and regression problems, and the results show that they outperform existing supervised
topic modelling approaches. The models can also be extended to use similar informa-
tion to the previous models, incorporating additional information such as entities and
document titles to improve prediction.

I N TRODUCT ION
This thesis presents new methods for modelling texts, their authors and their other
metadata. This motivation originates from the huge difficulties in analysing the in-
creasing number of document collections and databases. These collections are often
large, preventing the use of traditional and manual text analysis techniques, and often
contain errors and mistakes, requiring error-tolerant methods. Being able to integrate
these collections is valuable as it can often reveal additional patterns or information in
the data that cannot be obtained from any individual source. However, there are many
obstacles to integration. A lack of unique identifiers for each object, such as people or
documents, is one obstacle that can result in information being duplicated, and incom-
plete or missing document metadata can be another obstacle since it can be expensive to
manually fill in the metadata fields for new documents. Therefore, the ability to predict
document metadata based on document text would be highly useful.
Further, authors of documents are not typically associated with personally identifi-
able information such as national identity numbers. This can be due to privacy concerns,
for individuals may not wish to be linked across different databases. Another reason
may be the extra work involved in tracking down personally identifiable information.
More generally, the problem of record linkage involves finding duplicate records or re-
cord fields which refer to the same entity, or the same author in this case. Names are
usually used to match together authors, where in some methods, two identical names
are assumed to refer to the same person. However, names are often ambiguous in that
multiple people share the same name, and names have variations in that the same per-
son can be referred to by different names. Name ambiguity is an increasingly common
problem given the growing volume of document collections. Name variation is also
common due to different ways of formatting a name and as a result of name initialling,
aliases and typographical errors.
Following these problems, resolving an author name into a person requires analys-
ing any extra data that appears with the name. This could include the email address of
the author or the affiliation of the author. But both properties become obsolete when a
person changes institution. These pieces of information are also usually missing from
author metadata. On the other hand, the title or abstract of a document is commonly
available and can be used to help resolve names. For example, two authors working in
1
2
unrelated fields of expertise are unlikely to be the same person even if they have similar
names. But two authors working on the same field may be the same person even if their
names are slightly different. Existing techniques for solving this problem often calcu-
late pairwise distances between names and use these to cluster similar names together,
where a cluster represents the references or names for a single person or entity. Even
though they perform well, these techniques cannot evaluate a cluster as a whole and are
often unable to estimate the probability of a name belonging to a cluster. These exist-
ing techniques also fail to make use of coauthorship relationships within a document,
where resolving one name helps resolve the others.
Finally, being able to predict document metadata from the text of a document is
highly useful. The metadata might include labels such as category, rating, popularity or
other information. Given a set of examples of documents and their metadata, it would
be useful to have a model that can learn to predict the metadata of an unseen document.
Supervised latent Dirichlet allocation, a type of supervised topic model, is an existing
model for this problem, but it has shortcomings in that the number of topics must be
fixed in advance and the effect of different words on the document labels is not modelled
directly.
This thesis addresses the problems of these existing techniques and presents four new
approaches for solving these problems by developing new models and by using ideas
from Bayesian nonparametrics, topic models and generalised linear models. The thesis
is laid out as follows.
• In Chapter 2, I describe the background to the name disambiguation problem and
review existing approaches.
• In Chapter 3, I give an overview of Bayesian methods, which are relevant to this
thesis. In addition, I review some of themain Bayesian nonparametric techniques,
which are a recurring theme in later chapters.
• In Chapter 4, I present the author-topic space model for disambiguation. This is
a novel unsupervised model that integrates name variation modelling and topic
modelling. Two name variation models are proposed, one is based on the bigram
topic model and the other is based on a bag-of-words assumption for a set of
character-level trigrams. The models are evaluated with two different inference
algorithms on real-world datasets.
• In Chapter 5, I extend the work in Chapter 4 and present the grouped author-topic
model, which is a new unsupervised model that uses coauthorship relationships
along with document text to improve disambiguation. The chapter also describes
3
an extension of the nested Dirichlet process. This work was presented at the NIPS
workshop on applications for topicmodels (Dai and Storkey, 2009) and at ICANN
(Dai and Storkey, 2011).
• In Chapter 6, I present two novel models for supervised learning with topic mod-
els. The keyword-supervised LDA model directly models the effect of different
words on document labels, giving more accurate label predictions than existing
models. The model also allows words to have different effects on the document
labels according to their context. The supervised HDP model is an extension of
supervised latent Dirichlet allocation to infinite topics. These models are evalu-
ated on classification and regression tasks and compared with existing models.
• In Chapter 7, I give an overview and comparison of the models presented in this
thesis.
• Finally, in Chapter 8, I review the contributions of the thesis and discuss future
work.

BACKGROUND
In this chapter, I describe the background to the problems to be tackled in later chapters
and existing approaches to solving the problems.
2.1
Name disambiguation or identity disambiguation is the task of linking real people iden-
tities with their names in databases and records. It is highly similar to the problem of
record linkage (Fellegi and Sunter, 1969), also known as de-duplication, which is an im-
portant problem in data integration and data mining. Data is stored using manymethods
and formats and with many different conventions. As a result, it can be difficult to gain
the benefits that result from integrating data from different sources. Themost commonly
encountered problem is performing name or entity de-duplication. Many data sources
about people, for example, neither record a person’s national identification number nor
any other personally identifiable information nor store information that can be easily
cross-referenced with other data sources. The terms person, entity and identity are often
interchangeable when referring to these problems.
Fellegi and Sunter (1969) developed a framework by Newcombe et al. (1959) into
a mathematical formulation for record linkage, with the emphasis on developing an
efficient linkage rule. This fundamental model has gone through much analysis and de-
velopment. These approaches all went through the same process of defining a similarity
measure and then specifying and estimating distributions for matches and non-matches.
The methods were motivated by a need for linkage in census data (Hogan, 1992; Wink-
ler and Thibaudeau, 1991), but it has also seen much use in medical data (Torvik et al.,
2005), brain imaging (Clayden, Storkey and Bastin, 2007) and citation indexing (Giles,
Bollacker and Lawrence, 1998). Coupled clustering (Marx et al., 2002) is also a relevant
method that uses linked information from multiple datasets to enable better clustering
than can be obtained from a single dataset. An overview of some recent approaches can
be found in Winkler (2006).
Most common approaches calculate pairwise scores andmatch records on the basis of
those scores, though alternative approaches can have better performance, such as those
that can compute scores for entire clusters of records or can better model prediction

errors. This indicates that more sophisticated models can better solve the problem such
as those from machine learning. Machine learning techniques (Mitchell, 1997; Bishop,
2006) are resistant to noisy data and work well with unstructured data. They include
models such as the single-layer perceptron and naive Bayes models.
Some approaches also exploit the large quantity of data on the Internet (Tan, Kan and
D. Lee, 2006). Other methods for disambiguation use other fields of documents includ-
ing co-authors, author emails, institution affiliation and venue of publication (Culotta
et al., 2007). In general, unified approaches such as these are needed for the best dis-
ambiguation performance, though they come with a computational cost.
The core of these methods usually involves stringmatching. This is the task of match-
ing together strings which likely refer to the same thing, for which nearest neighbour
methods are often used. One area of development that can help to reduce the cost asso-
ciated with finding these nearest neighbours during clustering is the locality sensitive
hashing (LSH)method (Indyk andMotwani, 1998). LSH is related to the idea of dimen-
sionality reduction in that similar objects are probabilistically mapped to the same set of
buckets. These developments can significantly improve the performance of some of the
clustering approaches by allowing the nearest neighbour search to be completed in faster
than linear time. Comparisons of string matching algorithms and metrics for names
have been made by Cohen, Ravikumar and Fienberg (2003) and Christen (2006). They
compared methods including phonetic techniques such as Soundex and pattern match-
ing techniques such as 𝑛-gram similarity and edit distances. 𝑁-grams are sequences of
words or characters of length 𝑛 commonly used as a similarity measure. They found that
small changes in similarity thresholds can significantly affect name matching perform-
ance and that thresholds can vary between datasets. They also could not find any single
best technique for name matching. Although they found that an 𝑛-gram similarity ap-
proach was competitive with the Jaro and Winkler algorithms. Further, Gong, L. Wang
and Oard (2009) proposed modelling name similarity by finding the minimum number
of transformations applied to a name such as abbreviation, omission and rearranging.
Authorship attribution is a related problem to name disambiguation where the goal
is to find the authorships of anonymous text solely based on the text itself. The prob-
lem has a long history as there has long been interest in identifying the true author
of texts written under a pseudonym or when the author of old texts may be unknown.
Traditional methods have relied on examining writing styles using text features such as
word length and sentence length whereas more recently, statistical methods have been
used to analyse word frequencies and find common patterns that a particular author
uses. Mosteller and Wallace (1964) was one of the most influential works in author-
ship attribution. They used Bayesian statistical techniques to find the authorship of The
2.1 6
Federalist Papers, of which 12 essays have unclear authorship. Stamatatos (2009) and
Koppel, Schler and Argamon (2009) give surveys of past and recent methods used for
authorship attribution. Modern techniques such as SVMs have also been applied to the
attribution problem (Diederich et al., 2003), which have been valuable since the in-
put text has high dimensionality. Recent techniques have used learning ensembles of
character-level n-grams (Stamatatos, 2006) to represent the style of a text and identify
the author. More recent applications for these methods include plagiarism detection and
author verification.
2.1.1 Cita on matching
Automated bibliographic services such as CiteSeerX (Giles, Bollacker and Lawrence,
1998), Google Scholar (Google, 2004) and Rexa (Wellner et al., 2004) are growing in
popularity thanks to the speed at which they index new publications and the breadth of
publications that they index. A common task when working with bibliographic data-
bases or proceedings is to cross-reference the references in a paper with papers in the
database. This is known as citation matching and can be thought of as entity disambig-
uation where the entities are papers. Since papers are usually referenced without unique
identifiers such as digital object identifiers (DOIs), citations are often matched by titles,
authors and venues. Complications can arise, however, when citation formats change,
such as in the order of the fields or in the varying punctuation styles that are used to
separate citation fields. Abbreviations are also used inconsistently, most often for de-
fining venue names (e.g. Int. for International). Finally, author names can be written in
confusing formats or orders, in which it can be hard to distinguish the first, middle and
last names. This has led to many wrongly filled out fields in automated citation indices.
Citation matching is also a popular application for the record linkage methods as test
citation data is often freely available.
Approaches include rules-based methods, which can quickly detect errors such as
dates in the wrong formats. However, the number of exceptions to the rules quickly
grow to be unwieldy, as is often the case with varying address formats. The problem
can be tackled by both relational and machine learning techniques. Relational models
have moved beyond pairwise matching, and modern methods learn both pairwise and
clusterwise scoring functions to integrate cluster-level information. Relational models
are also good at integrating data using rules and multiple data fields, such as for struc-
tured data in databases. They include approaches such as relational clustering (Bhat-
tacharya and Getoor, 2007), the relational probability model (Pasula et al., 2003) and
the probabilistic relational model (J. Li, G. A.Wang and Chen, 2008) to capture depend-
2.1 7
encies between co-authors and papers. Dredze et al. (2010) also proposed a model that
integrates information from other sources. Methods have also been explored for scal-
ing the task to large datasets. One approach is the canopy approach (McCallum, Nigam
and Ungar, 2000). This uses a cheap approximate distance to find overlapping subsets
containing data elements which are potentially close to each other. A more expensive
distance metric is used between elements that appear in the same subset. Elements that
do not appear in the same subset are assumed not to match.
The problem with many of these approaches is that they need a threshold or the
number of author identities to be fixed in advance. To overcome this problem, probab-
ilistic, nonparametric approaches have been explored. Bhattacharya and Getoor (2006)
presented the LDA-ER model, which is based on latent Dirichlet allocation, and which
can infer the number of author entities in the data. However, their method requires
pre-specifying the number of author groups and their algorithm assumes that author
references with identical names refer to the same entity, which is troublesome for am-
biguous names. Daumé III and Marcu (2005) showed that supervised training of Diri-
chlet processes (DPs) provided gains over traditional supervised clustering approaches.
They also found that the number of entities in a citation database, along with similar
linkage problems, match the expected number of clusters under a DP. This showed that
DPs are an appropriate model for these kinds of problems.
Though these techniques have worked well, many of them have difficulties in in-
tegrating information from multiple fields. Often, models which use information from
other fields perform better than those that solely disambiguate based on names (Hall,
Sutton and McCallum, 2008). The author-topic model (Rosen-Zvi et al., 2004) is one
example that associates latent topics with authors and identifies the topics that authors
frequently write on. In these works, a latent topic is characterised by a distribution over
the vocabulary of the corpus. However, instead of entity resolution, their goal was to
model the tendencies of authors to write on certain topics or subject areas assuming
the authors for each document in the training set are already known. The model then
allocates words in the document to one of the known authors and does not model au-
thor names so cannot take name variation into account. A similar generative model was
presented by Newman, Chemudugunta and Smyth (2006) for the entities in a document,
where the task is again to associate entities with topics. However, both these approaches
can require a significant amount of data in that, an author must appear many times in a
corpus for that author’s topic distribution to be sufficiently peaked to allow for disam-
biguation.
2.2 8
2.2
Coreference resolution is also related to the problem of name disambiguation. Corefer-
ence occurs when multiple phrases in a document refer to the same thing, in this case
the phrases are said to be coreferent. There are two variants of coreference resolution,
within-document and cross-document. These problems extend the classical problem of
record linkage by considering situations where additional information about the entity
is available, an entity can be referenced in a greater number of ways and entity metadata
must be extracted from the text. For example, additional considerations can include the
free text of a document, the context of the entity reference, the entity’s gender or other
biographical information about the entity.
Within-document coreference resolution is the problem where an entity is referenced
first as a named entity in a document (e.g.David Cameron) and then future references in
that document may consist of nominal references (e.g. the prime minister), pronominal
references (e.g. he) or named references using aliases (e.g. David). This is a harder
problem than named entity recognition as linking together these references is dependent
on semantics and syntax. The task involves creating clusters of references where each
cluster contains all and only those references that refer to the same real-world identity.
Tackling the problem involves generating a coreference chain that links together pairs
of anaphors and antecedents using features extracted from noun phrases in the docu-
ment. For example, Ms. Thatcher–her–She–Ms. Thatcher. Soon, H. T. Ng and Lim
(2001) proposed one of the first learning approaches for within-document coreference
resolution. This involved learning a decision tree classifier on noun phrases. Later ap-
proaches used various linguistic and feature set extensions (V. Ng and Cardie, 2002).
Approaches also include those that can generate multiple candidate clusterings (V. Ng,
2005) and then training a support vector machine (SVM) ranker to rank the clusterings.
A supervised method was proposed by Wick, Culotta et al. (2009) that in addition to
resolving entities, also canonicalises the entities by finding a standardised representa-
tion of the entity.
Unsupervised models, which are models that do not require a training dataset of la-
belled examples, have also been proposed for the problem. Haghighi and Klein (2007)
proposed an unsupervised generative model, which is based on the hierarchical Di-
richlet process, that explicitly models pronoun heads and salience. Their model yields
results only slightly lower than supervised systems. V. Ng (2008) modified their method
to use an EM clustering algorithm but showed that performance is still not comparable
to a fully supervised coreference system. Poon and Domingos (2008) developed an
unsupervised system that is based upon Markov logic networks. Finkel and C. D. Man-
2.2 9
ning (2008) explored the use of transitivity constraints enforced using integer linear
programming (ILP). Their approach uses logistic regression to classify entity refer-
ences and then an ILP solver to find the most probable solution under the constraints.
Haghighi and Klein (2009) developed an unsupervised pairwisemodel focusing on syn-
tactic and semantic information and using it to decide if two references refer to the same
entity. An overview of recent developments in supervised coreference resolution was
offered by V. Ng (2010).
There have been many competitions that recognised the problem of coreference res-
olution, though most of these have been for within-document coreference resolution.
Recently there have been large competitions focused on the problem of cross-document
coreference resolution. This variant is when an entity is referenced across several docu-
ments and the references must be resolved to the correct entities. The problem is harder
than within-document coreference resolution as there are additional difficulties. For
example, different entities can have the same name or the same entity might be re-
ferred to by different names. However, this problem is more general, and there are
more applications including entity tracking, name disambiguation and alias identifica-
tion. Cross-document coreference resolution has been the focus of the SEMEVAL 2007
workshop on web people disambiguation (WePS) (Artiles, Gonzalo and Sekine, 2007),
later WePS workshops (Artiles, Gonzalo and Sekine, 2009; Artiles, Borthwick et al.,
2010) and the Global Entity Detection and Recognition task of the NIST Automated
Content Extraction (ACE) 2008 evaluation (NIST Speech Group, 2008).
The majority of cross-document coreference resolution systems use agglomerative
clustering. Bagga and Baldwin (1998b) proposed one of the earliest systems for cross-
document coreference resolution based on an existing within-document coreference
resolution system. The entity clusters for each document that are found by the within-
document coreference system are passed through a sentence extractor that extracts sen-
tences relevant to each of the entities. The vector space model is used by storing the sen-
tences as vectors of terms. This allows the cosine similarity to be calculated between the
sentences for each pair of entities. If the similarity is above a preset threshold then the
two clusters are considered to be coreferent, that is they refer to the same entity. Other
approaches generally involve extending the feature set or improving feature extraction.
These include using patterns to extract biographical facts and using these as features
in a centroid agglomerative clustering algorithm (Mann and Yarowsky, 2003). Their
system is evaluated on artificial test data where pseudo-names are generated and real
entities are merged together. Gooi and Allan (2004) extended the use of pseudo-names
even further by creating a test set where each name reference is rewritten to Person
X. There have also been approaches that use classifiers. Fleischman and Hovy (2004)
2.2 10
trained maximum entropy classifiers to model the probability that two references refer
to the same entity and then used this classifier in an agglomerative clustering algorithm.
They used a wide range of features including the frequency of the name in census data,
the number of hits returned from web queries and semantic distance obtained from the
WordNet ontology.
Several approaches also use information extraction systems to extract named entities
and entity attributes from data surrounding the entity. Baron and Freedman (2008) ex-
plicitly handled the problems of name variation and entity disambiguation. They used
an existing information extraction system along with web-mined alias lists, character-
level edit distance and so on to model name variation. To model name ambiguity, they
used features such as name uniqueness in Wikipedia. The names are then clustered us-
ing an agglomerative clustering algorithm. There have also been approaches that use
fuzzy clustering instead of the previous hard clustering algorithms. Fuzzy clustering
allows references to be associated with more than one entity. Huang et al. (2009) used
an information extraction system to extract entity attributes and relations and then per-
formed clustering using a kernelised fuzzy clustering algorithm. Finin et al. (2009)
used a knowledge base that was constructed from various online databases. They used
features extracted from this knowledge base to train a support vector machine (SVM)
classifier to determine which pairs of references refer to the same entity. Mayfield et al.
(2009) used a within-document coreference resolution system using soundex, charac-
ter 𝑛-gram similarity, hashing and name alias lists to account for name variation. They
also used features including document similarity, thesauruses and information from
Wikipedia. They then trained SVM and decision tree classifiers to determine if any two
clusters refer to the same entity. The classifiers were run on pairs of clusters output by
the within-document resolution system with the result given by the transitive closure
of the pairs.
Finally, there has been work on tackling coreference resolution in large-scale data.
Rao, McNamee and Dredze (2010) described a system that uses a streaming clustering
algorithm and name hashing to scale to streaming data. Singh et al. (2011) describe a
distributed parallel inference technique to disambiguate authors and Wick, Singh and
McCallum (2012) describe a hierarchical latent entity model for disambiguating at large
scales. Entity disambiguation can also potentially be used for word sense disambigu-
ation and other problems in machine translation (Macherey et al., 2011).
Methods for phrase modelling are also relevant to the problem of coreference resol-
ution. Though topic models are typically applied on unigrams with the bag of words
assumption, developments have been made towards latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)
2.2 11
𝑛-gram models (Wallach, 2006; X. Wang, McCallum and Wei, 2007) that help prevent
the over-conflation of terms and topics as datasets grow larger.
A problem with many of the previous methods is that they are supervised and require
similarity thresholds to be trained on a training set or they may need outside sources
such as the web or Wikipedia. Many of them are also discriminative rather than gener-
ative, which means they often cannot take advantage of unlabelled data and they may
have difficulty integrating new information.

BAYES I AN METHODS
Bayesian statistics is a system for describing uncertainty, arising from lack of know-
ledge about the world, using probability. Bayesian statistical methods begin with a set
of prior beliefs and repeatedly update these with data to give posterior beliefs. The
posterior beliefs can then be used for statistical inference. Bayesian methods are an im-
portant part of modern machine learning, since they give a principled way to update a
model when new information is seen. Traditionally, due to the significantly increased
computational cost needed for Bayesian methods, Bayesian methods could only be used
for conjugate analysis, where the prior and likelihood must be jointly chosen so that the
posterior can be tractable. Recent improvements in computational performance and ad-
vances in Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) have made Bayesian methods computa-
tionally tractable and more attractive. The main difference between Bayesian methods
and frequentist methods is the idea that uncertainty about model parameters can be
expressed in Bayesian methods using probability distributions, commonly known as
prior distributions, and the use of probabilistic inference through marginalisation of
unknowns.
Statistical inference in general is about discovering information about unobserved
quantities. These can usually be divided into two types, the potentially observable
quantities such as those from future data and the unobservable quantities such as para-
meters. Parameters that are not directly observable are denoted 𝜃 and the observed data
are denoted 𝑥. Later in this chapter, Greek letters are used for parameters and Roman
letters for observable quantities. 𝑝(⋅|⋅) denotes a conditional probability density and 𝑝(⋅)
denotes a marginal density. When referring to standard probability distributions I will
write 𝜃 ∼ N(𝜇, 𝜎2) to mean 𝑝(𝜃) = N(𝜃|𝜇, 𝜎2) where 𝜃 has a normal distribution with a
mean of 𝜇 and variance 𝜎2.
Usually a set of 𝑛 observations, 𝑥 = (𝑥1, … , 𝑥𝑛) are assumed to be exchangeable.
This means that 𝑝(𝑥1, … , 𝑥𝑛) is invariant under permutation of the indices. A nonex-
changeable model would mean that some information is contained in the unit indices.
In this thesis, the words in documents are assumed to be exchangeable. This is called
the bag-of-words assumption, and even though the assumption is unrealistic, it is a reas-
onable assumption to make if the goal is to infer the abstract semantic themes in the
corpus. In general, observing a set of key words in a document is enough to work out
12
13
the theme of the document regardless of the order of those words. However, this may
not hold when the key words can be used in many different contexts, in which case
a phrase would better identify the theme. For example, the phrase investment bank is
more useful at identifying the theme of investment banking than investment or bank. In
addition, some themes may be very popular resulting in many different authors writ-
ing on that theme. Thus, more information than the theme of a document is needed to
disambiguate authors.
Bayesian inference is usually used to make statements about 𝜃 given 𝑥. To do this, a
model is constructed giving a joint probability distribution for 𝜃 and 𝑥. This distribution
is usually factored into a product of two distributions, the prior distribution 𝑝(𝜃) and the
likelihood 𝑝(𝑥|𝜃):
𝑝(𝜃, 𝑥) = 𝑝(𝜃)𝑝(𝑥|𝜃). (3.1)
Using Bayes’ theorem, which states that
𝑝(𝜃|𝑥) = 𝑝(𝜃)𝑝(𝑥|𝜃)𝑝(𝑥) (3.2)
and conditioning on the known 𝑥 we can arrive at the posterior density:
𝑝(𝜃|𝑥) = 𝑝(𝜃, 𝑥)𝑝(𝑥) =
𝑝(𝜃)𝑝(𝑥|𝜃)
∑𝜃 𝑝(𝜃)𝑝(𝑥|𝜃)
(3.3)
where the denominator is replaced with ∫ 𝑝(𝜃)𝑝(𝑥|𝜃) d𝜃 when 𝜃 is continuous. 𝑝(𝑥) is
usually considered a normalising constant as 𝑥 is fixed.
To make inferences about unknown observable quantities before observing any data,
the distribution for the unknown quantities can be found by marginalising 𝜃:
𝑝(𝑥) = 𝑝(𝑥, 𝜃) d𝜃 = 𝑝(𝜃)𝑝(𝑥|𝜃) d𝜃. (3.4)
This gives the marginal distribution of 𝑥, also known as the prior predictive distri-
bution of 𝑥 since it is not conditioned on previous observations. After conditioning
3.1 14
on previous observations, we get the posterior predictive distribution for unobserved
future quantities 𝑥∗:
𝑝(𝑥∗|𝑥) = 𝑝(𝑥∗, 𝜃|𝑥)d𝜃 (3.5)
= 𝑝(𝑥∗|𝜃, 𝑥)𝑝(𝜃|𝑥)d𝜃 (3.6)
= 𝑝(𝑥∗|𝜃)𝑝(𝜃|𝑥)d𝜃. (3.7)
which follows since 𝑥 and 𝑥∗ are conditionally independent given 𝜃.
The likelihood function 𝑝(𝑥|𝜃) is treated as a function of 𝜃 for fixed 𝑥. Since the data
affect the inferences solely through the likelihood function, Bayesian inference follows
the likelihood principle. This states that all the information in a set of data is contained
within the likelihood function.
Bayesian modelling is concerned with finding the posterior distribution over the
model parameters. Bayesian and frequentist methods agree on the solutions for most
problems as sample size increases, however, for small sample sizes the Bayesian prior
can significantly change the result.
3.1
A graphical model is a family of probability distributions defined using a directed or
undirected graph. Jordan (2004) reviewed graphical models in detail along with infer-
ence in them and their applications. The nodes in the graph represent random variables
and joint probability distributions are defined by taking products over functions of the
nodes. Shaded nodes denote conditioning or observed variables. This method allows
for general algorithms to be used to compute marginal and conditional probabilities
and additionally provides an intuitive way of describing the model. Directed graphical
models (directed acyclic graphs) are commonly used to describe hierarchical Bayesian
models. The models described in this thesis are represented in terms of directed acyclic
graphs.
Plate notation (Buntine, 1994) is used to express repeated, shared or tied parameters
in a graphical model by enclosing the corresponding nodes in plates or rectangles, with
the figure in the corner indicating the number of times the nodes and arcs in that plate
should be replicated.
3.2 15
3.2
Distributions are often grouped into families that share the same parametric form but
have different parameters. Exponential families are especially important in Bayesian
models and have the following form.
𝑝(𝐱|𝜽) = 1𝑍(𝜽)𝐴(𝐱) exp(𝐭(𝜽)
⊤𝝉(𝐱)) (3.8)
where
𝑍(𝜽) =
𝐱
𝐴(𝐱) exp(𝐭(𝜽)⊤𝝉(𝐱)) (3.9)
is the partition function of 𝑝, which ensures the distribution is normalised and so must
be finite. The likelihood of 𝜽 depends on the data only through the function 𝝉 , so 𝝉 is
known as the sufficient statistics function, which is a function from values of 𝐱 to the
real numbers. The value of the statistic contains all the information needed to compute
the posterior distribution of the parameters given the data. 𝜽 ∈ 𝚯 are the parameters
for the distribution 𝑝(⋅|𝜽) in the family and 𝚯, the parameter set, is the set of legal
parameters for that family. 𝐭 is the natural parameter function that maps the parameters
to the space of sufficient statistics. When 𝐭(𝜽) = 𝜽, the family is said to be in canonical
form. Finally, 𝐴 is a measure over 𝐱. 𝐴 is used for observations that do not depend on
the parameters but later on it will be used as a constant.
The 𝐾-dimensional multinomial distribution is a multivariate generalisation of the
binomial distribution and is used extensively in text modelling. The multinomial dis-
tribution models a vector of counts 𝐱 of the number of observations for each dimension
𝑘. In the case where there is only one observation, with parameters 0 ≤ 𝜃𝑘 ≤ 1 and
∑𝐾𝑘=1 𝜃𝑘 = 1, then
𝑝(𝐱|𝜽) =
𝐾
𝑘=1
𝜃𝑥𝑘𝑘 (3.10)
which can be written in exponential family form as
𝑝(𝐱|𝜽) = exp
𝐾
𝑘=1
𝑥𝑘 ln 𝜃𝑘 (3.11)
= exp(𝐭(𝜽)⊤𝐱) (3.12)
3.2 16
for
𝑡(𝜃𝑘) = ln 𝜃𝑘 (3.13)
𝜏(𝐱) = 𝐱 (3.14)
𝐴(𝐱) = 1 (3.15)
𝑍(𝜽) = 1. (3.16)
Exponential families have many properties useful for statistical inference. One of
these is that only exponential family distributions have a sufficient statistic whose di-
mension remains bounded as the sample size of the data increases, enabling statistics for
large sample sizes to be stored efficiently. Exponential family distributions are also at
the core of distributions used in generalised linear models. Finally, with certain choices
of priors, known as conjugate priors, inference with exponential families is simpler than
with other distributions.
3.2.1 Conjugate priors
One of the useful properties of exponential families is that all members of the exponen-
tial family have conjugate priors. A conjugate prior distribution 𝑝(𝜽) for a likelihood
function 𝑝(𝐱|𝜽) is a distribution that will give rise to a posterior distribution that has
the same functional form as the conjugate prior. This simplifies inference on models
that can use them. For a member of the exponential family, its conjugate prior is:
𝑝(𝜽|𝝌, 𝜈) = 𝑓(𝝌, 𝜈) 1𝑍(𝜽)𝜈 exp(𝜈𝜽
⊤𝝌) (3.17)
where 𝑓(𝝌, 𝜈) is a normalisation constant and 𝜈 can be interpreted as the number of
pseudo-observations in the prior, where each pseudo-observation has the sufficient stat-
istic 𝝌 .
For the 𝐾-dimensional multinomial distribution, the conjugate prior distribution is
the 𝐾-dimensional Dirichlet distribution which is a multivariate generalisation of the
beta distribution. TheDirichlet distribution is defined over 0 ≤ 𝜃𝑘 ≤ 1with∑𝐾𝑘=1 𝜃𝑘 = 1
and parameters 𝛼𝑘 > 0:
𝑝(𝜽|𝜶) = 1B(𝜶)
𝐾
𝑘=1
𝜃𝛼𝑘−1𝑘 (3.18)
3.3 17
where
B(𝜶) =
∏𝐾𝑘=1 Γ(𝛼𝑘)
Γ(∑𝐾𝑘=1 𝛼𝑘)
(3.19)
This prior distribution is equivalent to the likelihood from ∑𝐾𝑘=1 𝛼𝑘 observations
where there are 𝛼𝑘 observations for dimension 𝑘. Typically, a non-informative sym-
metric prior distribution is used in which case, 𝛼𝑘 are all set to the same value such
as 𝛼𝑘 = 1. The posterior distribution for 𝜽 is a Dirichlet distribution with the new
parameters 𝛼𝑘 + 𝑥𝑘. The parameters 𝜶 of the conjugate prior distribution are called
hyperparameters.
3.3
Clustering is an unsupervised method that can be useful in recovering structure from
data. Clustering methods find groups of similar data points in a dataset. There is no
training dataset of labelled examples. The method is useful in identity disambiguation
and record linkage problems since usually the true entity or identity of any reference
is unknown, due to the name variation and name ambiguity problems. A reasonable
approach is to find references or records that are most similar to one another and if
they satisfy the right conditions, infer that they are coreferent. Greedy agglomerative
clustering is one common method of clustering a dataset of 𝑁 data points 𝑥1, … , 𝑥𝑁
into 𝐾 clusters given a value for 𝐾 . The algorithm proceeds iteratively where initially
each data point is assigned to its own cluster. The pair of clusters closest to each other
(defined by a distance metric and a linkage criterion) are found and merged and this
repeats until there are 𝐾 clusters remaining.
3.4
One common approach for posterior inference is Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
(Metropolis et al., 1953). A recent overview of MCMC is given in Brooks et al. (2011).
MCMCmethods scale well with the dimensionality of the samples and are often easy to
implement. The method works by iteratively drawing 𝜃 from approximate distributions
that depend on the last value drawn. These approximate distributions are improved at
each step of the process and converge to the target distribution 𝑝(𝜃|𝑥). This is necessary
when it is too inefficient to sample directly from 𝑝(𝜃|𝑥).
3.4 18
MCMC began as a way to find out about the thermodynamic equilibrium of a liquid
by simulating the dynamics of the system, running it until it reached equilibrium. The
major idea was that the exact dynamics did not need to be simulated, only a Markov
chain that has the same equilibrium distribution. TheMetropolis algorithm (Metropolis
et al., 1953) pioneered MCMC, which was later generalised to the Metropolis-Hastings
algorithm (Hastings, 1970). Later on, the Gibbs sampler (S. Geman and D. Geman,
1984) was introduced initially to find posterior modes rather than simulating the pos-
terior distribution. This greatly improved the popularity of Bayesian methods as it was
found that MCMC enabled many previously infeasible methods.
More formally, a sequence 𝑋1, 𝑋2, … of random variables is a Markov chain if the
conditional distribution of 𝑋𝑛 given 𝑋1, … , 𝑋𝑛−1 only depends on 𝑋𝑛−1. The set which
contains the possible values of 𝑋𝑖 is then the state space of theMarkov chain. The trans-
ition probabilities are usually assumed to be stationary in that the conditional distribu-
tion of 𝑋𝑛 given 𝑋𝑛−1 is independent of 𝑛. The joint distribution of a Markov chain is
then completely determined by the marginal distribution of 𝑋1 (the initial distribution)
and the conditional distribution of 𝑋𝑛 given 𝑋𝑛−1 (the transition probability distribu-
tion). Markov chains are a special case of a stochastic process, which is essentially a
sequence of random variables.
The transition probability distributions must be constructed so that the Markov chain
has a unique stationary distribution which is the target distribution. Firstly, the sequence
can be shown to have a unique stationary distribution if the Markov chain is irreducible
(it is possible to get to any state from any other state), aperiodic (each state may be
returned to at irregular times) and not transient (each state will be returned to in finite
time with probability 1). Secondly, the transition probabilities can be chosen to satisfy
detailed balance with respect to the target distribution, so that the target distribution is
the stationary distribution.
While, in Metropolis-Hastings, the full state vector may be updated in a transition,
in Gibbs sampling only part of the state is updated. In Gibbs sampling, a special case
of Metropolis-Hastings, the proposal for the next state in the Markov chain is from the
conditional distribution, which is proportional to the target distribution. The conditional
distribution used is of one component of the state given the rest of the components. A
variant of this known as blockGibbs is to use the conditional distribution with several of
the components omitted so that several variables are updated in one transition. Finally,
collapsed Gibbs is when some of the components can be integrated out.
3.4 19
3.4.1 Convergence checking and posterior summaries
It can be unclear whether the MCMC chain has converged after a number of iterations.
Informally, a common method is to look at traces or autocorrelation plots of summaries
of important variables in the state of the chain, such as the size of the largest cluster or
values of parameters. The number of iterations before the chain has appeared to visually
converge is then often used as the burn-in, which is the number of iterations at the start
of MCMC that are ignored since they do not come from the stationary distribution and
are overly influenced by the initial distribution.
More formally, there have been many proposed convergence diagnostic techniques,
with the two extremes being running a single chain for a long time (Geyer, 1992) and
running several chains from different starting points (Gelman and Rubin, 1992). There
is no consensus about which method is the best diagnostic, however, due to the growing
ease of running multiple chains with modern computers, the multiple chain diagnostic
is often used. The idea behind the single chain method is that by looking at autocor-
relation within the chain, it can be estimated how long the chain takes to converge.
The multiple chain method, on the other hand, compares the within-chain variance of a
variable with the between-chain variance of the variable. If the between-chain variance
is significantly greater than the within-chain variance then it is likely the case that the
chains have not yet fully mixed and so have not yet converged.
The Gelman and Rubin diagnostics describe the calculation of potential scale re-
duction factors which collate the data from multiple Markov chains to estimate the
between-chain and within-chain variance for various variables and use those to monitor
convergence. Assuming there are 𝑚 Markov chains each of length 𝑛 after discarding the
burn-in samples and the scalar estimand, such as the size of the largest cluster, for each
3.4 20
sample is denoted as 𝜓𝑖𝑗 , 𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑚, 𝑗 = 1 … , 𝑛 then the potential scale reduction
factor can be calculated as
𝐵 = 𝑛𝑚 − 1
𝑚
𝑖=1
(𝜓 𝑖⋅ − 𝜓 ⋅⋅)2 (3.20)
𝜓 𝑖⋅ =
1
𝑛
𝑛
𝑗=1
𝜓𝑖𝑗 (3.21)
𝜓 ⋅⋅ =
1
𝑚
𝑚
𝑖=1
𝜓 𝑖⋅ (3.22)
𝑊 = 1𝑚
𝑚
𝑖=1
𝑠2𝑖 (3.23)
𝑠2𝑖 =
1
𝑛 − 1
𝑛
𝑗=1
(𝜓𝑖𝑗 − 𝜓𝑖⋅)2 (3.24)
where 𝐵 and 𝑊 are the between and within sequence variances respectively. The mar-
ginal posterior variance of the estimand, var(𝜓), can be estimated by
var(𝜓) = 𝑛 − 1𝑛 𝑊 +
1
𝑛𝐵. (3.25)
The potential scale reduction is then an estimate of the factor which the scale of the
distribution for 𝜓 would be reduced in the limit of infinite simulations:
?̂? = var(𝜓)𝑊 . (3.26)
When ?̂? is near 1, this indicates that the chain has appeared to converge and no
further simulations are needed. However, even if a simulation passes all convergence
tests, it can still be far from convergence if important areas of the target distributionwere
not in the starting distribution and if it is hard to reach those areas with the transition
probabilities.
Once the Markov chain has converged to the posterior distribution, the question of
how to summarise the probability distribution arises. Commonly, summary statistics
are taken across a final number of samples in the Markov chain. The more samples that
are used, the more confidence can be given to the posterior distribution that has been
estimated. Some algorithms advocate subsampling the chain to reduce autocorrelation,
in which every 𝑘th state of the chain is used and all other states are removed. However,
it has since been proved that throwing away this data does not improve the answer or
accuracy of the approximation (MacEachern and Berliner, 1994). Thus, the only reason
3.5 21
for subsampling is to reduce the quantity of data that needs to be analysed for long
running simulations. No subsampling is used for the results in this thesis.
Finally, identifiability is a common problem inmixture models involvingMCMCdue
to the use of discrete hidden variables. This happens when the posterior distribution is
invariant when the values (labels) of the discrete hidden variable are permuted. This
results in non-identifiable labels. For example, in a Gaussian mixture model with two
clearly defined mixture components A and B, label-switching can happen. This is be-
cause permuting the component assignments to B and A results in the same posterior
probability. The mean location of the data points from a certain mixture component
can then be equal to the mean of the whole data set. However, label-switching is not a
problem if the quantities of interest are also invariant under label permutation. This is
the case for the posterior summaries used later in the thesis. However, if they are not
invariant, such as when examining a topic distribution across many samples, then com-
paring values across samples becomes a problem. There are several ways to deal with
the problem including imposing constraints to break symmetry, building a sampler for
which switching labels is unlikely and relabelling mixture components. To avoid this,
I will examine topic distributions from one sample of the posterior.
3.5
The algorithms presented in Chapter 2 focus on matching entities, records or citations
by scanning for similar strings. However, often two records that have several matching
fields do not refer to the same entity. This is especially the case when integrating records
from multiple domains, such as in combining citation databases from neuroscience and
machine learning. In this case, different people may have identical names, concepts
may be described using different terminologywithin the different domains and the same
termmay have differentmeanings in the different domains.When this kind of ambiguity
exists, topic models can help by inferring the abstract themes that are described within
the free text in the record.When two records have similar themes, then it can be inferred
that some of their fields may refer to the same entity. An approach for inferring the
themes among a collection of documents is topic modelling, where a set of latent topics
can be thought to represent the abstract themes of the corpus.
Probabilistic topic models are based on the idea that documents are mixtures of lat-
ent topics, where a topic is a probability distribution over the vocabulary. Steyvers and
T. Griffiths (2007) gave an overview of modern approaches. Topics have an advantage
over traditional spatial representations, such as the vector space model (Salton, Wong
and Yang, 1975), by being a generative model for documents. Since they represent the
3.5 22
data in a lower-dimensional form, they are related to traditional dimensionality reduc-
tion techniques such as PCA (Pearson, 1901). Topic models can also be viewed in a
relational context as modelling differing classes of objects, which after extension to
hierarchical topic models can include class inheritance.
Topic models make an exchangeability assumption: that the words in the documents
and the documents themselves are unordered. This is weaker than the commonly used
independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) assumption.
David M. Blei, Jordan and A. Y. Ng (2003) introduced the most common topic
model, the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) model, as a Bayesian extension to an exist-
ing probabilistic topic model, the probabilistic latent semantic indexing model (pLSI)
(Hofmann, 2001), which was itself an extension of LSA (Deerwester et al., 1990). LDA
uses a finite mixture generative model in which multinomial document-specific mixing
proportions are drawn from a Dirichlet distribution. Each word in the document is an
independent draw from this mixture model (proportions of topics). LDA takes the es-
sential idea that a document is generated from a mixture of topics; which is modelled
as the following process: a distribution over topics is chosen, for each word, a topic
is chosen from that distribution and then a word is drawn from that topic. Inference
techniques invert these steps to find the set of topics that generate the corpus. The LDA
model has proved extremely versatile, and a variety of extensions have been proposed
that extend it to modelling topic dynamics (David M Blei and Lafferty, 2006), rela-
tions (Chang and D. Blei, 2009) and n-grams (Wallach, 2006). Real-world applications
where topic models have proved useful are for modelling and learning correlations of
topics across multiple documents or corpora and for modelling the genetic haplotypes
among human subpopulations (Xing et al., 2006).
LDA is a hidden variable model in that the observed data are the words of each doc-
ument and the hidden variables indicate to which topic each of the words are allocated.
The posterior distributions of the hidden variables are useful for tasks from informa-
tion retrieval to document browsing. Since multiple topics are allocated to each docu-
ment, this can be thought of as a mixed-membership model or admixture as opposed to
traditional topic models where each document is limited to one topic. The generative
process, a random process that can be thought of having produced the observed data,
is as follows. Let 𝐾 be the fixed number of topics, 𝑉 the size of the vocabulary of the
corpus, 𝜶 a positive 𝐾-dimensional vector and 𝜼 a positive 𝑉 -dimensional vector.
1. For each topic 𝑘,
a) Draw a distribution over the vocabulary 𝜷𝑘 ∼ Dirichlet(𝜼).
2. For each document 𝑖,
3.5 23
a) Draw a vector of topic proportions for the document 𝜽𝑖 ∼ Dirichlet(𝜶).
b) For each word 𝑗,
i. Draw a topic for the word 𝑧𝑖𝑗 ∼ Multinomial(𝜽𝑖).
ii. Draw the word 𝑤𝑖𝑗 ∼ Multinomial(𝜷𝑧𝑖𝑗 ).
The components of 𝜼 are usually set to the same value, leading to a symmetric Diri-
chlet distribution.Wallach,Mimno andMcCallum (2009) examined the effect of a fixed
symmetric 𝜼 compared with optimising 𝜼 during the inference process and find that a
symmetric 𝜼 yields the best performance. 𝜶 is also usually set to a symmetric Dirichlet
distribution as there is no prior reason to prefer any topics over any other. Optimisation
strategies for 𝜶 are also explored in their paper. The posterior of a LDA model can be
explored by analysing the distribution of each topic. 𝜷 gives the probability of a word
appearing in a topic and this allows a topic to be summarised by the highest probability
words in a topic.
3.5.1 Inference
The hidden structure of the corpus is described by the hidden variables, the topics 𝜷,
the topic proportions for each document 𝜽 and the topic allocations for each word 𝐳.
The inferred topics in the corpus and topic mixture for each document can be analysed
in the posterior distribution.
The posterior distribution is as follows:
𝑝(𝜽, 𝐳, 𝜷|𝐰, 𝜶, 𝜼) = 𝑝(𝜽, 𝐳, 𝜷, 𝐰|𝜶, 𝜼)
∭ 𝑝(𝜽, 𝐳, 𝜷, 𝐰|𝜶, 𝜼) d𝜽 d𝐳 d𝜷
(3.27)
The exact posterior is intractable due to the need to sum over all possible allocations
of words to topics in the denominator. Gibbs sampling is commonly used for LDA in-
ference as the sampling can easily be adapted to extensions of LDA and Gibbs sampling
is easy to implement.
In LDA, since the prior distributions for 𝜽 and 𝜷 are Dirichlet distributions, they are
conjugate to the multinomial distributions and so 𝜽 and 𝜷 can be integrated out allow-
ing the joint distribution 𝑝(𝐰, 𝐳|𝜶, 𝜼) to be calculated. These can be calculated by just
keeping counts of which words are allocated to which topics. Assuming a symmetric 𝜼,
let 𝜂 be the value of each component of 𝜼. Assuming a symmetric 𝜶, let 𝛼 be the value
of each component of 𝜶.

𝑝(𝐰|𝐳) = Γ(𝑉𝜂)Γ(𝜂)𝑉
𝐾 𝐾
𝑘=1
∏𝑤 Γ(𝑛𝑤𝑘 + 𝜂)
Γ(𝑛⋅𝑘 + 𝑉𝜂)
(3.28)
where 𝑤 in 𝑛𝑤𝑘 indexes into the vocabulary and 𝑛𝑤𝑘 is the number of times word 𝑤 has
been assigned to topic 𝑘 and ⋅ means summing over that index so that 𝑛⋅𝑘 = ∑𝑉𝑣=1 𝑛𝑣𝑘.
𝑝(𝐳) = Γ(𝐾𝛼)Γ(𝛼)𝐾
𝐷 𝐷
𝑖=1
∏𝑘 Γ(𝑛𝑖𝑘 + 𝛼)
Γ(𝑛𝑖⋅ + 𝐾𝛼)
(3.29)
where 𝑛𝑖𝑘 is the number of words in document 𝑖 that have been assigned to topic 𝑘 and
𝑛𝑖⋅ = ∑𝐾𝑘=1 𝑛𝑖𝑘. The posterior is then
𝑝(𝐳|𝐰) = 𝑝(𝐰, 𝐳)∑𝑧 𝑝(𝐰, 𝐳)
. (3.30)
After cancelling some of the terms in the above equations, the full conditional distri-
bution for each topic allocation variable needed for Gibbs sampling, 𝑝(𝑧𝑖𝑗|𝐳−𝑖𝑗 , 𝐰), can
be obtained:
𝑝(𝑧𝑖𝑗 = 𝑘|𝐳−𝑖𝑗 , 𝐰) ∝
𝑛−𝑖𝑗,𝑤𝑖𝑘 + 𝜂
𝑛−𝑖𝑗,⋅𝑘 + 𝑉𝜂
𝑛−𝑖𝑗𝑖𝑘 + 𝛼
𝑛−𝑖𝑗𝑖⋅ + 𝐾𝛼
(3.31)
where the counts do not include the current allocation, 𝑧𝑖𝑗 as indicated by the −𝑖𝑗 su-
perscripts. For sampling, the topic allocation variables are initialised randomly and the
values of 𝐳 sampled using the above equation for a number of iterations until the chain
appears to have converged to the posterior. A number of samples from the posterior are
then taken and 𝜷 and 𝜽 can be estimated from the samples.
̂𝛽𝑤𝑘 =
𝑛𝑤𝑘 + 𝜂
𝑛⋅𝑘 + 𝑉𝜂
(3.32)
̂𝜃𝑖𝑘 =
𝑛𝑖𝑘 + 𝛼
𝑛𝑖⋅ + 𝐾𝛼
(3.33)
Once convergence has been reached, the model can be evaluated based on the per-
plexity of a held-out test set. Perplexity is equivalent to the inverse of the geometric
3.6 - 25
mean per-word likelihood so that a lower perplexity score indicates a higher likelihood
of the words and better performance. This score is defined as
exp −
∑𝐷𝑖=1 log 𝑝(𝐰𝑖)
∑𝐷𝑖=1 𝑛𝑖
(3.34)
where 𝑛𝑖 is the number of words in document 𝑖 and 𝑝(𝐰𝑖) can be approximated using
𝑝(𝐰𝑖|𝐰) with 𝐳 being sampled from the posterior.
3.5.2 Model selec on
LDA requires model selection to determine the number of topics, 𝐾 , in the model.
When 𝐾 is too large then incoherent topics that consist of rare word co-occurrences
can be learnt and when 𝐾 is too small the topics may be too broad to be useful. One
of the most popular ways of choosing 𝐾 is to use cross validation to find the 𝐾 that
gives the lowest perplexity. This requires many runs of the model and so can be costly
to perform. The hyperparameters 𝛼 and 𝜂 can be optimised during inference or set to
commonly used hand-tuned values such as 𝜂 = 0.1 and 𝛼 = 50/𝐾 (Thomas L. Griffiths
and Steyvers, 2004).
Bayesian nonparametric models present one solution to the problem of choosing 𝐾
as discussed in Section 3.8.7.
3.6 -
Author-topic models are a way to combine authorship information with topic mod-
els. The model of Rosen-Zvi et al. (2004) extends LDA by modelling authors. In their
model, each author is associated with a multinomial distribution over topics. This al-
lows authors to be compared using their distributions over topics. Each document is
modelled as a mixture of the topic distributions that are associated with the authors of
the document. In the generative process for the document: for each word, an author is
drawn from the authors of the document, then a topic is chosen from the distribution
over topics for that author, and finally a word is drawn from that topic. Compared to
LDA, there is an additional latent variable for every word that indicates which author
that word is associated with.
In the author-topic model, the true authors for each document are known and so the
model cannot handle author ambiguity. There is also nomodel for author names so name
variation cannot be handled. Their model instead predicts authors for unseen documents
3.7 26
where only the full text of the document is available. Their model also assumes the
number of authors is fixed so that the model cannot learn to predict unseen authors.
Since in their model, every word must be associated with an author, the predictive
distribution for authors overweights authors who have authored many long documents
compared with authors who have authored few or many short documents. Authors who
are assigned to few words or who have authored few documents will also have a broad
distribution over topics making them hard to distinguish from other authors.
3.7
Nonparametric statistics is an approach that makes as few assumptions as possible
partly by using infinite-dimensional models. One of the main techniques in frequentist
nonparametrics is the use of statistical tests that do not assume a specific distribution.
A simple example of a nonparametric density estimation approach is a histogram with
fixed-size buckets. Since there are fewer assumptions, nonparametric methods can be
used on a wider range of problems than traditional parametric methods and allow for
robust models. On the other hand, using more robust techniques sacrifices statistical
power, and a larger dataset can be needed to achieve the same confidence levels that a
parametric approach gives. Bayesian nonparametrics are commonly used for problems
where no fixed model is assumed for the data. One way of thinking about this is the
need for a model where the structure can change and adapt to the data and can work in
large parameter spaces. As a result, Bayesian nonparametric models can be more diffi-
cult to work with than the models just described. Computation is also more difficult as
probability distributions on potentially infinite-dimensional spaces need to be manipu-
lated. These models can also be more difficult to set up, however, a major benefit is that
parts of the model structure no longer need to be fixed a priori. Bayesian nonparametric
models are rapidly attracting interest, due to the increasing quantity of data in problems
and advances in computation.
Recently, the Dirichlet process (DP) and Pitman-Yor process are growing in popular-
ity among Bayesian nonparametrics. The DP mixture model (Antoniak, 1974) is one
of the most popular models, which has partly been due to the ease of posterior com-
putation. These models are attractive since they are not restricted to a finite number of
latent clusters or features and so offer significantly extra modelling flexibility with infin-
ite mixture models. Posterior computation remains tractable since only a finite number
of clusters is needed to represent a finite quantity of data. These types of models have
been successfully used in density estimation, computational biology, computer vision
and natural language processing (Teh and Jordan, 2009).

3.8
A Dirichlet process (DP) (Antoniak, 1974; Ferguson, 1973) is a stochastic process that
can be thought of as a probability distribution on the space of probability measures.
The name of the process accurately describes that the DP results in finite-dimensional
Dirichlet marginal distributions, similar to the Gaussian process that has Gaussian dis-
tributed finite-dimensional marginal distributions. DPs are commonly used as a prior
on the space of probability measures, which give wider support and so improved flexib-
ility over using traditional parametric families as priors. In addition, DPs have tractable
posteriors so making them important in Bayesian nonparametric problems. The term
nonparametric can be interpreted as meaning that the number of model parameters may
grow indefinitely with the sample size. This contrasts with parametric models where
the number of parameters are independent of sample size.
3.8.1 Formal defini on
Ferguson (1973) initially introduced the idea of a Dirichlet process to exploit the con-
jugacy of the process for grouped data. A Dirichlet process (DP) is a distribution over
measures. With a DP, there is a positive probability of drawing a previously drawn
value, and thus the draws are discrete with probability 1. If the draws were continuous,
then there would be zero probability of exactly drawing a previously drawn value. The
property that these draws are discrete is very useful for clustering in DP mixtures. The
DP is a natural generalisation of Dirichlet distributions to infinite dimensions.
Let 𝑄 be a finite measure on a measurable space 𝒴 . A random measure, 𝑃 , on
𝒴 follows a Dirichlet process if for every finite measurable partition (𝐵1, … , 𝐵𝑘) of
𝒴 , the distribution of (𝑃(𝐵1), … , 𝑃(𝐵𝑘)) is a Dirichlet distribution with parameters
𝑄(𝐵1), … , 𝑄(𝐵𝑘). 𝑄 can be decomposed into 𝐺0(𝐴) = 𝑄(𝐴)/𝛼 and 𝛼 = 𝑄(ℝ) so that
𝑄 = 𝛼𝐺0. 𝐺0 is a probability function and is known as the base measure of the Dirichlet
process as it gives the expectation of 𝑃 . 𝛼 is a positive scalar known as the concentration
or precision parameter. We then write that 𝑃 ∼ DP(𝛼, 𝐺0). If 𝑋1, … , 𝑋𝑛 is a sample
from 𝑃 then the posterior distribution of 𝑃 given 𝑋1, … , 𝑋𝑛 is also a Dirichlet process
but with parameter 𝑄 + ∑𝑛𝑖=1 𝛿𝑋𝑖 , where 𝛿𝑥 denotes a measure with the point 𝑥 having
mass one. This property allows the posterior to be relatively easy to calculate, but as a
result, there is no smoothing in the posterior.
Ferguson also offered an alternative definition of the DP in terms of the gamma pro-
cess and used it to show that the Dirichlet process is a discrete probability measure.
3.8 28
3.8.2 S ck-breaking construc on
The stick-breaking representation described by Sethuraman (1994) is another repres-
entation of the Dirichlet process. This representation gives a method to directly sample
from the DP and shows that draws from the DP are composed of a weighted sum of
point masses. The point masses can be referred to as atom locations and the weights as
stick lengths.
𝛽𝑘 ∼ Beta(1, 𝛼) (3.35)
𝛽𝑘 = 𝛽𝑘
𝑘−1
𝑞=1
(1 − 𝛽𝑞), for 𝑘 = 1, … , ∞ (3.36)
𝜃𝑘 ∼ 𝐺0 (3.37)
𝝅|𝐺0 ∼ DP(𝛼, 𝐺0) =

𝑘=1
𝛽𝑘𝛿𝜃𝑘 (3.38)
Figure 3.1: The s ck-breaking weights where 𝛽1, 𝛽2, … are the non-overlapping lengths of
pieces gradually broken from a s ck of unit length.
The distribution on the sequence {𝛽1, …} is sometimes referred to as the GEM(𝛼)
distribution where GEM stands for Griffiths, Engen and McCloskey.
The stick-breaking construction is based on independent sequences of random vari-
ables (𝛽𝑘)∞𝑘=1 where ∑∞𝑘=1 𝛽𝑘 = 1 almost surely. These weights exponentially tend to-
wards zero so only a small number of clusters are needed to model a finite dataset. An
example of the distribution of the stick weights is shown in Figure 3.1. This construc-
tion also shows that draws from the DP are discrete as it puts weight 𝛽𝑘 on the atoms
𝛿𝜃𝑘 where 𝜃𝑘 is distributed according to the base distribution 𝐺0.
3.8.3 DP mixture models
TheDirichlet processmixture (DPM) (RadfordM.Neal, 2000) is very useful in Bayesian
density estimation and comes about when parametric families are mixed nonparamet-
rically. It is often used in clustering to model a countably infinite number of mix-
3.8 29
ture components. Finite mixture models usually require finding the number of clusters
through model averaging or model selection whereas infinite mixture models makes
this work unnecessary. DPMs were originally motivated as a method of smoothing a
DP by convolving with parametric models. In a DPM model, the 𝑛 observations 𝑥𝑖 are
modelled by a parametric family with latent parameters 𝜒(𝑥𝑖|𝜃𝑖), 𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑛. These
observations are required to be exchangeable so that de Finetti’s theorem applies. The
theorem states that for any infinitely exchangeable sequence, there exists a probab-
ility distribution 𝐹 where there is an underlying parameter and the observations are
conditionally independent given that parameter. The marginal density for a 𝑥𝑖 is then
𝑓(𝑥𝑖) = ∫ 𝜒(𝑥𝑖|𝜃𝑖)d𝐺(𝜃𝑖). Since 𝐺 is unknown, a Dirichlet process prior can be used
as a prior for 𝐺 especially since it has wider support than parametric family priors. The
prior for the density 𝑓 is then known as the Dirichlet process mixture. Assuming the
DP has a concentration parameter 𝛼 and a base distribution 𝐺0 then:
𝐺|𝐺0 ∼ DP(𝛼, 𝐺0) (3.39)
𝜃𝑖|𝐺 ∼ 𝐺 𝑖 = 1, 2, … , 𝑛 (3.40)
𝑥𝑖|𝜃𝑖 ∼ 𝐹(𝜃𝑖) (3.41)
Since 𝐺 is discrete, there is a non-zero chance that more than one 𝜃𝑖 shares the same
value. This can be viewed as a mixture model where the 𝑥𝑖 that share the same 𝜃𝑖 are
in the same cluster.
From a mixture modelling perspective and the stick-breaking construction, (3.39)
can be written in terms of a cluster assignment or indicator variable 𝑧𝑖. Taking 𝝅 to
be a probability distribution over the positive integers, then 𝑧𝑖 takes the value 𝑘 with a
probability 𝜋𝑘. Since the 𝜃𝑖 are exchangeable, the cluster indicators 𝑧𝑖 can be reordered.
𝜋𝑘 ∼ Beta(1, 𝛼) (3.42)
𝜋𝑘 = 𝜋𝑘
𝑘−1
𝑞=1
(1 − 𝜋𝑞) for 𝑘 = 1, … , ∞ (3.43)
𝑧𝑖|𝝅 ∼ 𝝅 𝑖 = 1, 2, … , 𝑛 (3.44)
𝜙𝑘|𝐺0 ∼ 𝐺0 (3.45)
𝑥𝑖|𝑧𝑖, 𝝓 ∼ 𝐹(𝜙𝑧𝑖) (3.46)
where 𝐺 = ∑∞𝑘=1 𝜋𝑘𝛿𝜙𝑘 and 𝜃𝑖 = 𝜙𝑧𝑖 . 𝜙𝑘 are the parameters that determine the distri-
bution of observations in cluster 𝑘, the 𝑥𝑖 are drawn from a mixture of distributions
𝐹(⋅) and 𝐺0 is the base distribution for the cluster parameters. Since the mixing pro-
3.8 30
portions drop exponentially quickly, a finite number of clusters is used to model the
observations.
The DP has been extended to new distributions as well as new classes of nonpara-
metric objects including the Pitman-Yor process (Pitman and Yor, 1997) and the hier-
archical Dirichlet process (HDP). The DP has proved very useful in modelling observa-
tions with an unknown number of cluster components. The dependent Dirichlet process
(DDP) (MacEachern, 1999) extends the Dirichlet process to cover multiple dependent
distributions, either in the cluster locations or the cluster weights. This can be used for
spatial and dynamic processes.
3.8.4 Choosing concentra on parameters
Setting the value of the concentration parameter 𝛼 for a Dirichlet process DP(𝛼, 𝐺) can
be a difficult problem. A priori, the number of clusters represented in a dataset of a given
size is dependent on 𝛼. In general for a sequence of Dirichlet processes, as 𝛼 → ∞, the
sequence converges to the base distribution 𝐺. On the other hand, as 𝛼 → 0, the limit
is a process that places all the mass on one single point sampled from the prior 𝐺. In
the mixture model, there will be many clusters as 𝛼 → ∞ to cover 𝐺 and few clusters
as 𝛼 → 0 since the mass will be concentrated on a few points sampled from 𝐺. The
prior distribution of the number of clusters 𝐾 given 𝛼 and a sample size 𝑛 is defined
(Escobar and West, 1995):
𝑝(𝐾|𝛼, 𝑛) = 𝑐𝑛(𝐾)𝑛! 𝛼𝐾
Γ(𝛼)
Γ(𝛼 + 𝑛) (3.47)
where 𝑐𝑛(𝐾) are the absolute values of Stirling numbers of the first kind and satisfy:
𝑐𝑛+1(𝐾) = 𝑛𝑐𝑛(𝐾) + 𝑐𝑛(𝐾 − 1) where 𝑐𝑛(𝑛) = 1. For large 𝑛, 𝑝(𝐾|𝛼, 𝑛) reduces to:
E(𝐾|𝛼, 𝑛) ≈ 𝛼 ln(1 + 𝑛𝛼 ) (3.48)
The formula (3.47) allows the conditional posterior distribution of 𝛼 given the sampled
number of clusters 𝐾 to be calculated, so 𝛼 can be updated by sampling from this pos-
terior. When the prior for 𝛼 is a mixture of gamma distributions, it becomes possible
to sample from the exact posterior of 𝛼. When a conjugate prior is not used for 𝛼, slice
sampling (Radford M Neal, 2000) can be used to sample from its posterior.
Assuming that 𝑝(𝛼) = Gamma(𝛼|𝑎, 𝑏) with parameters shape 𝑎 > 0 and rate 𝑏 > 0
then:
𝑝(𝐾|𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑛) =
∞
0
𝑝(𝐾|𝛼, 𝑛)𝑝(𝛼|𝑎, 𝑏)d𝛼 (3.49)
3.8 31
and from (Escobar and West, 1995), the posterior for 𝛼 is a mixture of two gamma
densities:
𝛼|𝜂, 𝑘 ∼ 𝜋𝜂 Gamma(𝑎 + 𝑘, 𝑏 − log(𝜂)) + (1 − 𝜋𝜂) Gamma(𝑎 + 𝑘 − 1, 𝑏 − log(𝜂))
(3.50)
where 𝜋𝜂 is defined by the ratio
𝜋𝜂
1 − 𝜋𝜂
= 𝑎 + 𝑘 − 1𝑛(𝑏 − log(𝜂)) (3.51)
and 𝜂 is sampled from
𝜂|𝛼, 𝐾 ∼ Beta(𝛼 + 1, 𝑛) (3.52)
A non-informative prior for 𝛼 is obtained when 𝑎 = 0 and 𝑏 = 0. This prior puts an
almost uniform probability density over a wide range of values for 𝛼. However, with
this prior 𝑝(𝐾 = 1|𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑛) → 1, so that a priori, there are very few clusters. Other
typical priors for 𝛼 such as Gamma(3.5, 0.5) also result in much of the probability mass
being placed on a low number of clusters. Dorazio (2009) suggested an alternative
approach where the prior for 𝛼 is induced by a uniform prior on 𝐾 . This is found by
minimising the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between a uniform distribution for
𝐾 and 𝑝(𝐾|𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑛).
− log 𝑛 − 1𝑛
𝑛
𝑘=1
log(𝑝(𝐾|𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑛)) (3.53)
Since 𝑝(𝐾|𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑛) cannot be expressed in closed form, Dorazio (2009) uses numerical
quadrature to calculate (3.49), though this is very slow for large 𝑛. Instead, I use Monte
Carlo integration to calculate (3.49) and use (3.53) to find 𝑎 and 𝑏. This approach is
used to choose the prior for 𝛼 in the remainder of the thesis.
3.8.5 Chinese restaurant process
The Chinese restaurant process (CRP) is the process that results from integrating out
the random measure in the Dirichlet process. This process is often referred to when
using MCMC sampling for DPs as it makes posterior inference tractable. The process
can be thought of as follows. A restaurant has an infinite number of round tables in it,
each of which can hold one dish as well as an infinite number of customers. There is
an infinite queue of customers from which each customer comes in one-by-one into the
3.8 32
restaurant and chooses to sit at a table. The customer can choose to sit at an already
unoccupied table or the next unoccupied table. The probability of a customer sitting at
an occupied table 𝑘 is 𝑛𝑘/(𝑛 + 𝛼) where 𝑛𝑘 is the number of customers already sitting
at that table, 𝑛 is the number of customers already sitting in the restaurant and 𝛼 is the
concentration parameter of the CRP. The probability of the customer sitting at an empty
table is 𝛼/(𝑛 + 𝛼). This results in an exchangeable distribution over the tables that each
customer chooses to sit at. In addition, the probability of a specific customer sitting
at a particular table is the same no matter what position it was in the queue. During
posterior inference when inferring which table a particular customer is sitting at, the
customer can be treated as if he was the last customer to come into the restaurant so
significantly simplifying the problem. Since customers prefer to sit at tables with larger
numbers of existing customers, this behaviour is also known as the rich gets richer.
3.8.6 Inference for Dirichlet processes
Gibbs sampling via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is the most common method
for posterior inference for Dirichlet processes. Recently additional methods have also
been proposed such as variational mean field inference, slice sampling and retrospective
sampling. However, MCMC remains the simplest to implement and is relatively easy
to adapt to extensions to the DP model. Gibbs sampling involves sampling from the
conditional distributions of variables, which is often easier to sample from than the joint
distribution. Since samples from a Dirichlet process are exchangeable, the conditional
distributions of each variable are relatively easy to sample from.
Conjugate models
Inference is significantly simpler in the DP when 𝐺0 is the conjugate prior for the like-
lihood 𝐹 . In this case, the parameters for each cluster can be integrated out, and only
the allocations of observations to clusters need to be recorded. Assuming the state of
the Markov chain solely consists of the cluster indicator variables, 𝑧1, … , 𝑧𝑛 for 𝑛 ob-
servations, 𝑥1, … , 𝑥𝑛, then Gibbs sampling occurs by the following.
For 𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑛, draw a new value for 𝑧𝑖|𝑧−𝑖, 𝑥𝑖 from
𝑃(𝑧𝑖 = 𝑘|𝑧−𝑖, 𝑥𝑖) =

(3.54)
3.8 33
where the superscript −𝑖 indicates the variable with the contribution from 𝑧𝑖 removed,
𝑛−𝑖𝑘 is the number of 𝑧𝑗 = 𝑘 where 𝑗 ≠ 𝑖, 𝑏 is a normalising constant and 𝐻−𝑖𝑘 is the
posterior distribution of 𝝓 based on the prior 𝐺0 and all observations 𝑥𝑗 where 𝑗 ≠ 𝑖
and 𝑧𝑗 = 𝑘.
When𝐹 is a𝑀-dimensionalmultinomial distribution and𝐺0 is a symmetricDirichlet(β),
𝝓 can be integrated out as follows:

sideration the normalising factor for a Dirichlet density:

(3.60)
where Γ is the gamma function, which is an extension of the factorial function and

−𝑡𝑡𝑧−1 d𝑡 for positive 𝑧.
Non-conjugate models
Sometimes a conjugate prior might not exist for a certain likelihood function and so the
parameters 𝝓 cannot be integrated out. There are several methods for sampling from
a non-conjugate DP model, but the one that is used most frequently is algorithm 8
described by Radford M. Neal (2000). This is an auxiliary-variable sampling method
that samples 𝝓 as required and proposes new clusters based on samples of 𝜙𝑘 from the
3.8 34
prior 𝐺0. Singleton clusters, which are clusters that only have one observation allocated
to them, are treated specially in this algorithm. The state of the Markov chain now
consists of both the cluster indicators 𝑧1, … , 𝑧𝑛 and the cluster parameters 𝜙1, … , 𝜙𝐾
where 𝐾 = max(𝑧1, … , 𝑧𝑛). Let 𝑚 be the number of auxiliary variables to use.
1. For 𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑛, let 𝑘− be the number of distinct 𝑧𝑗 for 𝑗 ≠ 𝑖, and let ℎ = 𝑘− + 𝑚.
These 𝑧𝑗 are labelled between 1 and 𝑘−. If 𝑧𝑖 = 𝑧𝑗 for some 𝑗 ≠ 𝑖, i.e. it is not a
singleton cluster, then draw values independently from 𝐺0 for the 𝜙𝑘 for which
𝑘− < 𝑘 ≤ ℎ. If 𝑧𝑖 ≠ 𝑧𝑗 for all 𝑗 ≠ 𝑖, i.e. it is a singleton cluster, then set 𝑧𝑖 to 𝑘− +1
and draw values independently from 𝐺0 for the 𝜙𝑘 for which 𝑘− + 1 < 𝑐 ≤ ℎ.
Then draw a new value for 𝑧𝑖 from 1, … , ℎ according to
𝑃(𝑧𝑖 = 𝑘|𝑧−𝑖, 𝑥𝑖, 𝜙1, … , 𝜙ℎ) =

where 𝑛−𝑖𝑘 is the number of 𝑧𝑗 = 𝑘 where 𝑗 ≠ 𝑖 and 𝑏 is a normalising constant.
The 𝜙𝑘 that are not associated with any observations can be removed from the
state.
2. For 𝑘 = 1, … , 𝐾 where 𝐾 = max(𝑧1, … , 𝑧𝑛), draw a new value from 𝜙𝑘|𝑥𝑖
such that 𝑧𝑖 = 𝑘 or perform some other update to 𝜙𝑘 that leaves this distribution
invariant.
For ease of implementation, my experiments use 𝑚 = 1.
3.8.7 Hierarchical DPs
The hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) (Teh, Jordan et al., 2006) is a hierarchical ex-
tension to DPs. The hierarchical structure provides an elegant way of sharing paramet-
ers and atoms. This process defines a set of probability measures 𝐺𝑖 for 𝐷 pre-specified
groups of data and a global probability measure 𝐺0. The global measure is distributed
as
𝐺0|𝛾, 𝐻 ∼ DP(𝛾, 𝐻) (3.62)
where 𝐻 is the base probability measure and 𝛾 is the concentration parameter.
The random measures for each group are conditionally independent given the global
measure
𝐺𝑖|𝛼0, 𝐺0 ∼ DP(𝛼0, 𝐺0) (3.63)
3.8 35
where 𝛼0 is a concentration parameter. The distribution 𝐺0 varies around 𝐻 by an
amount controlled by 𝛾 and the distribution 𝐺𝑖 in the group 𝑖 varies around 𝐺0 by an
amount controlled by 𝛼0. This can also be seen as adding another level of smoothing
on top of DPM models and allowing atoms to be shared across groups. Let 𝜃𝑖1, 𝜃𝑖2, …
be i.i.d. variables distributed to 𝐺𝑖 and each of these variables is a parameter that cor-
responds to an observation 𝑥𝑖𝑗 , the likelihood of these observations being
𝜃𝑖𝑗|𝐺𝑖 ∼ 𝐺𝑖 (3.64)
𝑥𝑖𝑗|𝜃𝑖𝑗 ∼ 𝐹(𝜃𝑖𝑗) (3.65)
where 𝐹(𝜃𝑖𝑗) is the distribution of 𝑥𝑖𝑗 given 𝜃𝑖𝑗 . This prior results in a Dirichlet process
(DP) being associated with each group in the model where the DPs are conditionally
independent given their parent and the atoms drawn in the parent node are shared among
the descendant groups. This structure can also be extended tomultiple levels. A diagram
of atoms being shared among groups of data is given in Figure 3.2.
Figure 3.2: The randommeasures from aHDP. The basemeasure is con nuous at the top level,
themiddle level is the global randommeasure that has all the atoms and the atoms
are shared between the two resul ng group-level randommeasures at the bo om,
though each of them puts different weights on the atoms. The x-axis represents
atom loca ons and the y-axis represents atom weights.
3.8 36
The HDP requires the data to be in a pre-defined nested structure and is unable to
discover this structure automatically in unstructured data. The model has been used
in information retrieval tasks and used in relation with traditional TF-IDF measures
(Cowans, 2004) for measuring the score of documents in relation to a query. A vari-
ation of HDP uses pachinko allocation to model topics for documents where there is no
predefined hierarchical structure (W. Li, D. Blei and McCallum, 2007).
Similarity to LDA
With the appropriate base measure, the HDP can be thought of as the infinite analogue
of LDA. In the HDP, the base probability measure allows for a countably infinite num-
ber of multinomial draws and so an infinite number of topics. This allows the number
of topics to grow or shrink according to the data. This solves the problem of using
cross-validation to find the best number of topics in LDA and reduces the problems of
overfitting or underfitting due to a fixed number of topics. One of the main differences
between HDP and LDA is the posterior probability of a topic in any document. HDP is
similar to a version of LDA where the probability of a topic in a document 𝜽 is optim-
ised during sampling. As a result, the probability of a topic appearing in a document is
related to the number of times that topic has appeared in other documents. However,
typically in LDA, 𝜃 is not optimised and instead drawn from a symmetric Dirichlet dis-
tribution so that all topics have equal probability of appearing in a document. Wallach,
Mimno and McCallum (2009) recommended that LDA is used with an optimised 𝜽 as
it encourages function words (words which are not helpful in describing the topics) to
be grouped together in one topic rather than spread across multiple topics.
Sampling concentra on parameters
Assuming that 𝑝(𝛼0) = Gamma(𝛼0|𝑎, 𝑏) with parameters shape 𝑎 > 0 and rate 𝑏 > 0, 𝛼0
can be sampled by the following method as described in (Teh, Jordan et al., 2006). Let
𝑛𝑖𝑡 be the number of observations allocated to table 𝑡 in document 𝑖. For 𝐷 documents
and each document 𝑖, we define two auxiliary variables 𝑤𝑖 and 𝑠𝑖 where 𝑤𝑖 takes values
in [0, 1] and 𝑠𝑖 is a binary variable:
𝛼0
𝛼0 + 𝑛𝑖⋅
= 1Γ(𝑛𝑖⋅)
1
0
𝑤𝛼0𝑖 (1 − 𝑤𝑖)𝑛𝑖⋅−1 1 +
𝑛𝑖⋅
𝛼0
d𝑤𝑖 (3.66)
where 𝑛𝑖⋅ is the number of observations in document 𝑖.
3.8 37
The following distribution is then defined:
𝑞(𝛼0, 𝐰, 𝐬) ∝ 𝛼
𝑎−1+𝑚⋅⋅
0 e−𝛼0𝑏
𝐷
𝑖=1
𝑤𝛼0𝑖 (1 − 𝑤𝑖)𝑛𝑖⋅−1
𝑛𝑖⋅
𝛼0
𝑠𝑖
(3.67)
Marginalising out 𝛼0 and then dividing gives the conditional distribution for 𝛼0 as:
𝑞(𝛼0|𝐰, 𝐬) ∝ 𝛼
𝑎−1+𝑚⋅⋅−∑𝐷𝑖=1 𝑠𝑖
0 e−𝛼0(𝑏−∑
𝐷
𝑖=1 log 𝑤𝑖) (3.68)
Given 𝛼0, the auxiliary variables are conditionally independent, so they are sampled
from the distributions:
𝑞(𝑤𝑖|𝛼0) ∝ 𝑤
𝛼0
𝑖 (1 − 𝑤𝑖)𝑛𝑖⋅−1 (3.69)
𝑞(𝑠𝑖|𝛼0) ∝
𝑛𝑖⋅
𝛼0
𝑠𝑖
. (3.70)
Sampling each of these variables in turn typically mixes within 20 iterations.

In Chapter 2, I described the entity resolution problem and its related sub-problems.
In Chapter 3, I introduced a number of Bayesian nonparametric and topic models. The
framework laid out in this chapter utilises the previous models to build a general ap-
proach for tackling identity resolution and author disambiguation. In addition, the ap-
proach incorporates information available from the text in documents. The framework
uses a generative model of both the text of a document and its list of authors to resolve
identities in a corpus of documents. This approach is an unsupervised method, mak-
ing no assumption about the true number of identities in the corpus. Thus, a separate
training set with information about the true authors is not needed.
Author names in papers can often contain transcription or OCR errors, especially
when scanned from physical documents. This means that the documents written by an
author cannot typically be found by an exact string search on the author name. Another
problem is that common names may be ambiguous, and further analysis of the docu-
ment text is needed to investigate if the documents are by the same author. My joint
author-topic space model for disambiguation takes this into account. By using a non-
parametric model, no assumption regarding the total number of author entities needs
to be made. I use each document’s abstract to infer the set of topics that compose the
paper. The association of these topics with the authors from a name variant model im-
proves the inference of the author entities. Each latent topic is a distribution over the
vocabulary as described in Section 3.5 and can be thought of an abstract theme. Com-
pared with parametric topic models, mymodel makes no assumption regarding the total
number of topics. My method simultaneously infers the disambiguated author entities
and the topics upon which the authors write. The performance of two Gibbs sampling
algorithms for inference is tested, and the model is evaluated on real world datasets.
The remainder of this chapter is set out as follows. In Section 4.1, I present a brief
background to the problem and how the model developed in this chapter will tackle it.
In Section 4.2, I describe a high-level overview of the model, which is then developed
fully in Section 4.3. Section 4.5 describes two sampling algorithms that can be used to
infer the posterior distributions and quantities in Section 4.4. I then compare my model
with related models in Section 4.6 and describe experiments on real world datasets in
38
4.1 39
Section 4.8. Finally, I conclude in Section 4.9 with a discussion of the benefits and
disadvantages of the author-topic space model for disambiguation.
4.1
The task of coreference resolution, also known as record linkage, de-duplication or
entity resolution is a difficult and important step that is necessary for pre-processing
data before any large-scale data mining. This is important in the area of data integration
where records from disparate sources, such as a health care system and a social security
number system, need to be merged together. The problem in regard to academic papers
is particularly relevant for publication libraries such as Google Scholar, Citeseer and
DBLP. Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs), ISBNs and other global IDs all attempt to
tackle this problem, but none of them are in wide use. According to D. Lee et al. (2007),
the popular book ‘Artificial Intelligence: A modern approach’ has 23 unique records in
CiteSeer, with no direct links between them.
Transcription errors are very common in author disambiguation especially as names
cannot normally be corrected by dictionaries or spell checkers. In this chapter, an author
identity refers to a real-world individual and an author entity is a latent representation
of the author identity in the model. An author name refers to one of the multiple refer-
ences or names by which the individual is known. One of the most frequent and difficult
errors in foreign names originates from their transliteration. There are multiple meth-
ods for transliterating names in a foreign script into the Latin alphabet. For example, the
most common Chinese last name, Li, can be transliterated into more than seven other
forms including Lee, Lý, Ri and Lei. An author’s first name, though informative, is also
often abbreviated in citations, and the middle name may not appear or may even be a
substitute for the first name. An author’s name may also be an uncommon spelling of
a common name or different authors may share the same name. For documents where
no electronic copy exists, OCR errors typically occur frequently. In contrast to typo-
graphic errors, OCR errors have different characteristics since words may be broken,
e.g. error → err r, single characters may be recognised as multiple characters, e.g. m
→ iii, multiple characters may be recognised as single characters, single glyphs from
ligatures such as fi may be unrecognised and so on. These errors are propagated to other
documents by authors unwittingly citing names that contain errors.
Author disambiguation is often tackled by generating pairwise distance scores, often
between author names, and clustering on those scores, with a wide variety of techniques
including latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA)(Daumé III and Marcu, 2005; Torvik et al.,
2005; Bhattacharya and Getoor, 2006; Culotta et al., 2007; Kanani, McCallum and Pal,
4.1 40
2007) and others that are described in Chapter 2. These models are usually not generat-
ive models and so cannot make use of unlabelled data, such as a set of documents from
one of the authors. These approaches are also limited by not modelling dependencies
between names and other information in the paper such as its title and abstract, which
may be strong indicators of whether two author names refer to the same person by writ-
ing on the same topic. Hall, Sutton andMcCallum (2008) tackles this kind of cross-field
dependency for the problem of venue disambiguation. But each document usually only
has one venue of publication whereas there are often multiple authors for a document.
Models which take account of multiple fields and side information are usually more
successful than those that disambiguate solely on name.
In the development of the model, I take a Bayesian nonparametric modelling ap-
proach, based on the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) (Teh, Jordan et al., 2006).
The HDP mixture model allows data from different groups to be clustered together, as
described in Section 3.8.7. This model shares clusters among multiple Dirichlet pro-
cesses (DPs) and provides advantages over parametric methods such as LDA. In the
scenarios considered here, the number of entities (distinct authors) is unknown, and
a parametric approach based on a topic model would require this and the number of
topics to both be estimated, which can be a lengthy process. The number of entities is
unknown due to the errors described earlier, and the number of topics is unknown since
it is unknown how many different fields of expertise a corpus might cover. The number
of author entities in the corpus is expected to grow slowly since an author is likely to
write multiple documents in a corpus. Thus, DP mixtures as described in Section 3.8
and related mixture models are an appropriate model, as they have the two attractive
properties that the number of clusters in the model does not need to be known in ad-
vance and the number of clusters grows logarithmically fast with the data so inducing
sparsity.
The topics and authors are modelled collectively with a single set of latent variables
using the pre-defined documents as groups. The posterior cluster assignments of names
to entities are used to identify author entities together with the topics about which they
write. This means that each entity has its own topic or distribution over words. The
author-topic model (Steyvers, Smyth et al., 2004) also models both topics and sets of
authors who write about those topics given that the authors are known. However, their
author-topic model is unable to model authors that have the same name or authors that
have different names or aliases. I present a novel model for the problem of author disam-
biguation that takes account of these problems in a nonparametric generative approach.
4.2 41
4.2
Though approaches based on disambiguation with the aid of the author’s institutional
affiliation or email addresses have been explored, it is rare that these pieces of inform-
ation are available for all the authors in a document. On the other hand, the title and
abstract of a document are the basic pieces of a document that are almost always avail-
able. Thus, my approach only requires this basic set of available information.
The model in Section 4.3 is based on the idea of identifying author entities from a
combination of their name and the topics about which they write. I assume that the
dataset is a corpus of documents, where for each document 𝑖, the words in the text
or abstract 𝑤𝑖𝑗 are available where 𝑗 indexes into the words. I also assume a list of
author names 𝑎𝑖𝑗 is available, where 𝑗 indexes into the author fields. Each word can be
represented as a multinomial using one-of-𝑉 encoding where 𝑉 is the vocabulary size
of the corpus, so a word 𝑣 would be represented as a vector with 𝑤𝑖𝑗𝑘 = 1 for 𝑘 = 𝑣
and 𝑤𝑖𝑗𝑘 = 0 for 𝑘 ≠ 𝑣. Each author name can be a set of character 𝑛-grams with a bag
of words assumption represented by a multinomial vector where 𝑎𝑖𝑗𝑘 is the number of
times the 𝑛-gram 𝑘 appears in the author name. The name can also be a set of character
𝑛-grams that assumes a character level language model so that 𝑎𝑖𝑗𝑚|𝑛 is the number of
times the character 𝑚 appeared after 𝑛 in the author name. The author names are aliases
of the underlying author entity or identity. The text for the document may be composed
of a number of different themes or topics.
I assume a form of generative process where the distribution of topics and authors
for the corpus of documents is first jointly drawn from a DP prior. For each document,
a mixture of topics and authors is drawn. Each word in the abstract is generated by
drawing a topic and then a word given the topic. Each author in the author list is gen-
erated by drawing an author and then a sequence of character 𝑛-grams for the name for
that author. The base distribution for the topics is over the vocabulary of words used
in the corpus and for the authors it is over the 𝑛-grams used in author names. Prior as-
sumptions on the variance of the author names and topics can be made through the DP
hyperparameters. By using infinite mixtures of topics and authors, my model makes no
prior assumptions regarding how many entities or different topics exist, which is useful
as most of the time the true number of authors in a corpus is unknown. I evaluate the
model by inferring the author identities for the real-world citation database CiteSeer
and on a conflated version of that dataset. I compare against different name variation
models, inference algorithms and a basic baseline.
A 𝑛-gram is a sub-sequence of strings of length 𝑛 from a sequence. The set of bigrams
at the character level for a string consists of all the 2 character sequences in the string
4.2 42
as well as bigrams to cover the beginning and end of string markers. Similarly, trigrams
are the 3 character sequences. I explore a model that uses the bag of words assumption
(BOW), a simplifying assumption that the 𝑛-grams are independent. I also extend the
generative bigram model (Wallach, 2006) to a nonparametric setting. These 𝑛-gram
based approaches canmodel author entities that have name variants or last names which
have been corrupted or split into multiple words. Themodel of author names with BOW
trigrams assumes a bag-of-trigramsmodel where the ordering of the trigrams is ignored
and the parameters are assumed to be exchangeable. For example, the probability of the
name John would be calculated from marginal trigram frequencies as
𝑝(John) ∝ 𝑝(<s><s>J)𝑝(<s> Jo)𝑝(Joh)𝑝(ohn)𝑝(hn</s>) (4.1)
where 𝑝(𝑎𝑏𝑐) is the probability of the sequence of characters ‘abc’ appearing in an
author name, <s> is the start of name marker, </s> is the end of name marker and the
trigrams are assumed to be independent. The independence assumption is clearly false
since the string has been divided into overlapping substrings. However, some existing
string similarity techniques (Christen, 2006) make this assumption when using 𝑛-gram
similarity as a metric.
On the other hand, the generative bigram model for author names does not assume
exchangeability at the character level and is a model that can generate full author names.
The probability of the same name under this model using marginal and conditional
character frequencies is
𝑝(John) = 𝑝(J|<s>)𝑝(o|J)𝑝(h|o)𝑝(n|h)𝑝(</s>|n) (4.2)
𝑝(John) = 𝑝(<s>J)𝑝(Jo)𝑝(oh)𝑝(hn)𝑝(n</s>)𝑝(<s>)𝑝(J)𝑝(o)𝑝(h)𝑝(n) (4.3)
where 𝑝(𝑎|𝑏) is the probability of the character ‘a’ appearing after the character ‘b’ in
an author name. Thus in contrast to a BOW bigrammodel, the generative bigrammodel
has additional terms for the marginal frequencies of each character.
The marginal character probabilities in the model are typically estimated from the
number of times a character has occurred in the corpus, and the conditional probabilities
are estimated by the count of the number of times a character has followed another
character. Typically this model needs to be smoothed since many bigram orderings will
not be observed in the training set. The hierarchical Dirichlet language model (MacKay
and Peto, 1995) offers oneway of smoothing counts usingDirichlet priors. The resulting
model then allows predicting a character 𝑐𝑖 given the previous character 𝑐𝑖−1. Overall,
4.3 × 43
the BOW trigram model will have more parameters to be estimated than the generative
bigram model.
I use the bag-of-words assumption to model the words in the document. The model
can represent functionwords, which are words which only serve a grammatical purpose,
by allocating them to a cluster that is not associated to any author of the document.
Common words which are unlikely to be used in a specialised topic will also be more
likely to be allocated to this cluster.
My model in Section 4.3 assumes the same author entity can appear multiple times
in the author list for a document. This is a result of authors being sampled from the base
distribution with replacement whereas sampling without replacement would be a more
accurate model. In reality, this has little practical effect as the data rarely makes such
a repetition likely in the posterior. Even so it is worth commenting on why the model
takes this form: my use of the multinomial distribution has a simple Dirichlet conjugate
prior allowing the parameters to be integrated out and making inference easier.
I assume exchangeability for the parameters of observations, which is reasonable for
short abstracts. In longer documents, certain words that represent a more general topic
are more likely to appear in the background section of the document and more spe-
cialised words are likely to appear later when the methods are described. This could be
modelled by using separate models for the different parts of the document or a dynamic
topic model to describe each document’s progression of topics.
I make no assumptions that author names that reference the same author identity must
have the same last name or the same first initial. This allows the model to disambiguate
a wider range of ambiguous names than if that assumption is made, as on some existing
disambiguation test datasets. I also make no assumption that two authors with identical
names are the same person.
4.3 ×
In my model, I utilise concepts of topics and author-entities. Each topic is defined by
a multinomial distribution over the possible word occurrences, and each author entity
defines an author name model, representing the fact that a particular author entity may
be referred to in variousways. The basic idea is that if an author publishes on a particular
topic on one occasion, they are more likely to publish on that same topic on another
occasion, or use the same distribution over the vocabulary. I will describe the approach
in terms of the generative model illustrated in Figure 4.1.
At the top level, the model describes the corpus using a Dirichlet process over the
joint space of topics (word distributions) and author entities (author name models).
4.3 × 44
Figure 4.1: The author-topic space model for disambigua on in plate nota on. 𝑤 denotes
words and otherwise 𝑎 denotes authors. 𝐺 denotes random measures and 𝐻 de-
notes base measures. 𝐷 is the number of documents, 𝑁𝑤𝑖 is the number of words
in document 𝑖 and 𝑁 𝑟𝑖 is the number of authors in document 𝑖.
Because this DP is defined on this joint space, it incorporates the fact that a particular
author is likely to publish repeatedly on the same topic or use the same distribution
over the vocabulary. Generatively speaking, a random measure, denoted 𝐺0, is drawn
from this DP to represent the specific corpus. The base distribution of this DP is the
product measure, 𝐻𝑤 × 𝐻 𝑟, where 𝐻𝑤 = Dirichlet(𝜶𝑤) is the base distribution over
the space of topics (i.e. a distribution over word distributions). 𝐻 𝑟 = Dirichlet(𝜶𝑟) is
the base distribution over the space of author-entities (i.e. a distribution over author
name models). × is the Cartesian product so that (𝐻𝑤 ×𝐻 𝑟)(𝑡, 𝑎) = 𝐻𝑤(𝑡)𝐻 𝑟(𝑎) where
𝑡 is a topic and 𝑎 is an author name model. Superscript 𝑤 in my notation represents
distributions over words whereas 𝑟 represents distributions over author name models.
The base distribution 𝐻𝑤×𝐻 𝑟 provides the prior representation of how likely particular
author-name distributions (which are parameterised with 𝜃𝑟𝑖𝑗) and word distributions
(parameterised with 𝜃𝑤𝑖𝑗 ) are, across many different corpora.
At the document level, for each document 𝑖, 𝐺0 acts as a base measure for a draw
𝐺𝑖 from another DP. This encapsulates the fact that each document will focus on only
a small subset of all the possible topics, and will only be written by a small number
of possible authors. These authors and topics will potentially be different from those
of other documents. This DP is still defined in the joint topic-author space. The DP
concentration parameter for each document can also be modified independently if the
variability in the author word pairs is expected to be different. However, for the rest of
4.3 × 45
this chapter I assume that the concentration parameter is the same value for all docu-
ments.
For each document, the final stage is a generative model for the words and author
names in document 𝑖. Each observation 𝑥𝑖𝑗 from document 𝑖 denotes either the 𝑗th
author field (𝑎𝑖𝑗) or 𝑗th word (𝑤𝑖𝑗) in the document. For each author, I sample from 𝐺𝑖
and ignore the topic component, giving parameters 𝜃𝑟𝑖𝑗 . These are used to generate an
author name 𝑎𝑖𝑗 depending on the name variant model. For 𝑛-gram based name variant
models, names that appears with different transcription errors are likely to share many
𝑛-grams.
Then for each word 𝑗, I also sample from 𝐺𝑖 and ignore the author entity component
of 𝐺𝑖 giving a multinomial parameter 𝜃𝑤𝑖𝑗 . I draw words 𝑤𝑖𝑗 ∼ Multinomial(𝜃𝑤𝑖𝑗 ) from
this multinomial distribution over the corpus vocabulary.
Ignoring one or other component of the joint distribution does not break the ex-
changeability assumption since every word can be assumed to have hidden data (the
author who writes on the topic for that word). Each author also has hidden data (the
topic they write upon). As a result, exchanging author and word parameters in the doc-
ument results in the same joint distribution, and exchangeability is preserved.
In summary, I draw
𝐺0 ∼ DP(𝛾, 𝐻𝑤 × 𝐻 𝑟) (4.4)
𝐺𝑖 ∼ DP(𝜏, 𝐺0) (4.5)
(𝜃𝑤𝑖𝑗 , 𝜃𝑟𝑖𝑗) ∼ 𝐺𝑖 (4.6)
𝑤𝑖𝑗 ∼ Multinomial(𝜃𝑤𝑖𝑗 ) (4.7)
𝑎𝑖𝑗 ∼ 𝐹 𝑟(𝜃𝑟𝑖𝑗) (4.8)
to obtain the multinomial parameters associated with each word and author name, and
the words and author names generated from them. The distribution 𝐹 𝑟(𝜃𝑟𝑖𝑗) is the model
for the author name, which models variants of the author name as well as the transcrip-
tion, OCR or other errors in the author name. Since these errors normally occur at the
character level, it would be likely for names with long shared substrings to be variants
of the original name. As inference is significantly simpler and faster when using con-
jugate priors, I considered two substring models that have conjugate priors. The BOW
𝑛-gram model is a bag-of-words model for strings that share substrings of length 𝑛,
where in this chapter I use 𝑛 = 3 for performance. Wallach (2006) proposed a bigram
topic model that does not need to make a bag of words assumption. I extend this model
nonparametrically in Section 4.4.1 since the number of topics is not fixed. This enables
4.4 46
a generative model of author names based on substrings of length 𝑛, with 𝑛 = 2 for
performance. I refer to this model as the generative bigram model.
4.4
In this section, I describe the posterior distributions for the probabilistic models, in-
cluding both the generative 𝑛-gram model and the bag-of-words 𝑛-gram model for
modelling name variants. Observations are modelled as being drawn from a mixture
of distributions of the form 𝑓 𝑤(𝑤|𝜽) = ∏𝑉𝑡=1 𝜃
𝑤𝑡
𝑡 for each word where 𝑓 𝑟(𝑎|𝜽) for each
author where 𝑓 𝑟 depends on the author variant model and 𝜽 denotes the distribution’s
parameters. The observations are either authors or words. For each cluster 𝑘, the para-
meters 𝝓𝑘 = (𝝓𝑤𝑘 , 𝝓𝑟𝑘) determine the distribution of observations from cluster 𝑘.
For ease of computation, additional latent indicator variables 𝐳 are used for each au-
thor and each word to identify which cluster they are allocated to in the infinite mixture.
𝑓 𝑤new(𝑤𝑖𝑗) is the posterior distribution for a word with the (𝐻𝑤 ×𝐻 𝑟) prior and the single
observation 𝑤𝑖𝑗 and similarly for the author 𝑓 𝑟new(𝑎𝑖𝑗).
𝑓 𝑤new(𝑤𝑖𝑗) = 𝑓 𝑤(𝑤𝑖𝑗|𝝓𝑤)d𝐻𝑤(𝝓)
= 𝑏
Γ ∑𝑡 𝛼𝑤𝑡
Γ ∑𝑡 𝛼𝑤𝑡 + 𝑤𝑖𝑗𝑡 𝑡
Γ(𝛼𝑤𝑡 + 𝑤𝑖𝑗𝑡)
Γ(𝛼𝑤𝑡 )
(4.9)
where 𝑏 is a normalisation constant. Since the Dirichlet distribution is the conjugate
prior, this integral is analytically tractable and samples can be drawn from this posterior.
The conditional distributions for the words given cluster 𝑘 and all other data points
except for 𝑤𝑖𝑗 is
𝑓 𝑤,−𝑤𝑖𝑗𝑘 (𝑤𝑖𝑗) = 𝑓 𝑤(𝑤𝑖𝑗|𝝓𝑤)d𝐻−𝑖𝑗,𝑘(𝝓) (4.10)
where 𝐻−𝑖𝑗,𝑘 is the posterior distribution of 𝝓 with the prior and all data points allocated
to cluster 𝑘 for which (𝑖 , 𝑗 ) ≠ (𝑖, 𝑗):
𝐻−𝑖𝑗,𝑘(𝝓) ∝
(𝑖 ,𝑗 )≠(𝑖,𝑗)
𝑧𝑖 𝑗 =𝑘
𝑓(𝑥𝑖 𝑗 |𝝓)(𝐻𝑤 × 𝐻 𝑟)(𝝓) (4.11)
Since clusters are shared, the parameters 𝝓 are shared between documents. 𝝓𝑘 factor-
ises into 𝝓𝑤𝑘 for the parameters for the distribution that is over the words and 𝝓𝑟𝑘 for the
remaining distribution over bigrams. Since the Dirichlet distribution is the conjugate
prior, the parameters can be integrated out so that, in terms of bookkeeping, only the
4.4 47
allocations of data points to clusters need to be kept rather than the cluster parameters.
We get the following conditional densities,
𝑓 𝑤,−𝑤𝑖𝑗𝑘 (𝑤𝑖𝑗) = 𝑏
Γ ∑𝑡 𝑠𝑘𝑡
Γ ∑𝑡 𝑠𝑘𝑡 + 𝑤𝑖𝑗𝑡 𝑡
Γ(𝑠𝑘𝑡 + 𝑤𝑖𝑗𝑡)
Γ(𝑠𝑘𝑡)
(4.12)
where 𝑏 is a normalisation constant and 𝐬𝑘 is defined as
𝐬𝑘 = 𝛼𝑤 +
(𝑖 ,𝑗 )≠(𝑖,𝑗)
𝑧𝑖 𝑗 =𝑘
𝑤𝑤𝑖 𝑗 (4.13)
which are the posterior parameters derived from (4.9) for the words in cluster 𝑘 with the
prior (𝐻𝑤 × 𝐻 𝑟) and all data points 𝑤𝑖𝑗 and 𝑎𝑖𝑗 that are assigned to cluster 𝑘 for which
(𝑖 , 𝑗 ) ≠ (𝑖, 𝑗). When cluster 𝑘 does not contain any words when sampling for a word
or any authors when sampling for an author, then I draw a sample from the posterior
distribution in (4.9) and similarly for the authors.
4.4.1 Nonparametric genera ve 𝑛-gram model
To model the corruption and variants of author names, a flexible model is needed that
can tolerate small changes in the name. A generative approach to this can be taken
following the bigram topicmodel (Wallach, 2006). The bigram topicmodel is restrictive
since like in the LDA model, it still requires the specification of the number of topics
to use for the model whereas the nonparametric model I describe in this section does
not require this to be prespecified. This allows the model to adapt to the complexity
of the data and use more or less topics as needed. In this chapter, I use 𝑛 = 2 for
the generative 𝑛-gram model. The likelihood model for the authors with this model
is 𝑓 𝑟(𝑎|𝜽) = ∏𝑛 ∏𝑚 𝜃
𝑎𝑚|𝑛
𝑚|𝑛 where 𝑚 and 𝑛 are character indices, 𝑎𝑚|𝑛 is the number of
times character 𝑚 has appeared after character 𝑛 in the author name 𝑎 and 𝜽 denotes the
distribution’s parameters.
The conditional distributions for the authors given cluster 𝑘 and all other data points
except for 𝑎𝑖𝑗 is
𝑓 𝑟,−𝑎𝑖𝑗𝑘 (𝑎𝑖𝑗) = 𝑓 𝑟(𝑎𝑖𝑗|𝝓𝑟)d𝐻−𝑖𝑗,𝑘(𝝓) (4.14)
4.4 48
Since the Dirichlet distribution is the conjugate prior, the parameters can be integ-
rated out and now we only need to Gibbs sample the cluster indicators rather than the
cluster parameters. We get the following conditional densities,
𝑓 𝑟,−𝑎𝑖𝑗𝑘 (𝑎𝑖𝑗) = 𝑏
𝑛
Γ(𝑢𝑘𝑛)
Γ(𝑢𝑘𝑛 + 𝑎𝑖𝑗𝑛) 𝑚
Γ(𝑢𝑘𝑚|𝑛 + 𝑎𝑖𝑗𝑚|𝑛)
Γ(𝑢𝑘𝑚|𝑛)
(4.15)
where 𝑏 is a normalisation constant, 𝑎𝑖𝑗𝑛 is the number of occurrences of the character
𝑛 in the author name 𝑎𝑖𝑗 , 𝑢𝑘𝑛 = ∑𝑚 𝑢𝑘𝑚|𝑛 and
𝑢𝑘𝑚|𝑛 = 𝛼𝑟𝑛 +
(𝑖 ,𝑗 )≠(𝑖,𝑗)
𝑧𝑖 𝑗 =𝑘
𝑎𝑖 𝑗 𝑚|𝑛 (4.16)
which are the posterior parameters for the authors in cluster 𝑘. Thus, in terms of book-
keeping for this author namemodel, a matrix of howmany times one character followed
another character in author names needs to be stored for each cluster.
These posterior parameters for the Dirichlet compound multinomial distribution in
(4.15) have the effect of ‘damping’ the word and bigram counts for cluster 𝑘 by the
addition of the concentration parameter 𝛼𝑟 and reducing the effect of large counts on
the likelihood of the author entity.
4.4.2 BOW 𝑛-gram model
An alternate model for the corruption or variation of author names is to use a bag-of-
words assumption with a set of 𝑛-grams. This model is degenerate in that it models
non-names where the trigrams don’t tile as well as full names but it is simpler to im-
plement. However, as described in Section 4.2, this model makes a false independence
assumption and so is probabilistically deficient. Each author name is represented as a
multinomial for a set of 𝑛-grams, where in the experiments, 𝑛 is set to 3. The likelihood
model for the authors with this model is 𝑓 𝑟(𝑎|𝜽) = ∏𝑛 𝜃
𝑎𝑛
𝑛 where 𝑛 indexes into the
𝑛-grams used for author names in the corpus and 𝑎𝑛 is the number of occurrences of the
𝑛-gram 𝑛 in the author name 𝑎 and 𝜽 denote the distribution’s parameters.
The conditional distributions for the authors given cluster 𝑘 and all other data points
except for 𝑎𝑖𝑗 is given by (4.14) again.
4.5 49
Since the Dirichlet distribution is the conjugate prior, the parameters can be integ-
rated out and now we only need to Gibbs sample the cluster indicators rather than the
cluster parameters. We get the following conditional densities,
𝑓 𝑟,−𝑎𝑖𝑗𝑘 (𝑎𝑖𝑗) = 𝑏
Γ(𝑢𝑘)
Γ(𝑢𝑘 + 𝑎𝑖𝑗) 𝑛
Γ(𝑢𝑘𝑛 + 𝑎𝑖𝑗,𝑛)
Γ(𝑢𝑘𝑛)
(4.17)
where 𝑏 is a normalisation constant and 𝑢𝑘 is defined as
𝑢𝑘𝑛 = 𝛼𝑟𝑛 +
(𝑖 ,𝑗 )≠(𝑖,𝑗)
𝑧𝑖 𝑗 =𝑘
𝑎𝑖 𝑗 𝑛 (4.18)
which are the posterior parameters for the authors in cluster 𝑘. The bookkeeping for
this author name model is simpler than the generative model as only a vector of counts
of trigram occurrences in author names needs to be kept for every cluster.
The posterior parameters in theDirichlet compoundmultinomial distribution in (4.17)
have the same effect as in the generative 𝑛-gram model.
4.5
Since calculating the exact posterior under DP models is intractable as described in
Section 3.8.6, I use approximate algorithms. Due to the popularity and ease of imple-
menting and verifying aMCMC approach for Dirichlet processes, I use collapsed Gibbs
sampling based on the Pólya urn scheme for inference in this model. In this section, I
describe two Gibbs sampling algorithms which arise from either integrating out the
global random measures or sampling them.
Inference in my model follows from the auxiliary variable Gibbs sampler in the
Chinese restaurant process (CRP) description of the marginal probabilities of the DP
(Teh, Jordan et al., 2006) as outlined in Section 3.8.6. For the HDP mixture, the CRP is
extended to the Chinese restaurant franchise (CRF) in which there is a set of Chinese
restaurants, one for each group of observations and in this case, each document. Cluster
assignments are done through two layers of the model, the table level and the data point
level. First, customers or data points, which may be authors or topics, are assigned to
tables. Each table is then allocated a dish, which corresponds to the parameters for that
table. Tables that have the same dish are essentially assigned to the same mixture com-
ponent or cluster. The number of unique dishes is then the number of latent clusters.
These clusters are shared between all the restaurants. The result is that data points at
the same table share the same cluster, which in my model is the author entity and topic
4.5 50
that generates the data points. In relation to the CRF, I refer to a table when referring
to an inferred grouping of data points in a single document and a group when referring
to a document.
The final inferred authors for a document are the clusters that have been allocated to
the author field data points. Each cluster, which is in the author × topic space, contains
the 𝑛-gram parameters and topic for an author entity. Those clusters that do not have an
assigned author can be thought of as function word clusters that are not specific to any
author.
The likelihood of the data given the other clusters comes from the CRP, which in-
duces a clustering of the data due to the DP prior. This can be seen from the connection
to the Pólya urn model (Blackwell and Macqueen, 1973). Since the parameters are ex-
changeable, I can reorder the current parameter to be the one that was most recently
sampled and draw from a distribution conditional on the previous data points. After
integrating out 𝐺𝑖, the likelihood of the data point conditional on it being assigned to a
new table, 𝑡new, is then
𝑝(𝑥𝑖𝑗|t−𝑖𝑗 , 𝑡𝑖𝑗 = 𝑡new,k) =
𝐾

𝛽𝑘𝛿𝝓𝑘 + 𝛽new𝐺0 (4.21)
(𝛽1, … , 𝛽𝐾 , 𝛽new) ∼ Dirichlet(𝑚⋅1, … , 𝑚⋅𝐾 , 𝛾) (4.22)
where 𝐺0 is the global measure, 𝐺0 is the posterior for 𝐺0, 𝑚𝑖𝑘 is the number of tables in
document 𝑖 allocated to cluster 𝑘 and k are the allocations of tables to clusters. Eq. (4.22)
represents samples from the posterior of the base distribution, 𝐺0, where 𝜷 are the
stick-breaking weights for the sampled 𝐺0. The parameters 𝝓𝑘 of each cluster are also
integrated out.
Each data point in document 𝑖, position 𝑗 is first allocated to a table 𝑡𝑖𝑗 proportional
to how many other data points have already been allocated to that table. Table 𝑡 in
document 𝑖 is then allocated to a cluster 𝑘𝑖𝑡 in the topic and author product space. I will
refer to this method of indirect cluster assignments as the CRF sampler. In this sampler,
both 𝐺0 and 𝐺𝑖 are integrated out so allocations of tables to clusters need to be tracked.
The cluster and table allocations are sampledwithout any distinction between authors
and words. Allocating words to a table is only affected by the posterior parameters with
respect to the other words on the table and not to any of the authors. Similarly, allocating
4.5 51
authors to a table is only affected by the posterior parameters with respect to the other
authors. This is a result of the factorisation of the base distribution.
4.5.1 CRF sampler
TheCRF sampler involves alternately sampling the table allocation for each observation
and the cluster allocation for each table. In this sampler, both 𝐺0 and 𝐺𝑖 are integrated
out.
1. For each document 𝑖,
a) For the 𝑗th word (𝑤𝑖𝑗) and author (𝑎𝑖𝑗) in document 𝑖, which is denoted as
𝑥𝑖𝑗 , sample 𝑡𝑖𝑗 for the table allocation, where 𝑛
−𝑖𝑗
𝑖𝑡 is the number of observa-
tions allocated to table 𝑡 in document 𝑖 excluding 𝑥𝑖𝑗 ,
𝑝(𝑡𝑖𝑗 = 𝑡|t−𝑖𝑗 , 𝑘𝑖𝑡 = 𝑘, 𝐤−𝑖𝑗)

𝜏 𝛾
𝑚−𝑖𝑗⋅⋅ +𝛾
𝑓new(𝑥𝑖𝑗), if 𝑡 = 𝑡new, 𝑘𝑖𝑡new = 𝑘new
(4.23)
where 𝑓 is the corresponding likelihood function for the word and author
name variant model and when a new table is chosen, a cluster (𝑘𝑖𝑡new) is
sampled for it according to the probabilities above. If a table becomes empty,
the table and its cluster allocation is removed since 𝑛−𝑖𝑗𝑖𝑡 = 0 so the table will
never be allocated to any observations in the future.
b) Sample 𝑘𝑖𝑡 for the table to cluster allocation, where 𝑡 ranges over the tables
in document 𝑖,
𝑝(𝑘𝑖𝑡 = 𝑘|t, k−𝑖𝑡) ∝
⎧⎪

(4.24)
In the CRF sampler, many data points can change cluster at the same time since
changing the cluster of one table changes the cluster of all the data points that are
allocated to that table. This can potentially help clusters to merge. However, since the
allocation of data points to tables are a result of their prior clustering due to the DP, the
probability that a table will change its cluster will often be small.
4.5 52
4.5.2 Direct sampler
In the CRF sampler, data points are indirectly allocated to clusters through first be-
ing allocated to tables and this requires significant bookkeeping. As described in Teh,
Jordan et al. (2006), in the direct sampler 𝐺0 is sampled from instead of integrated out
to reduce the bookkeeping that is required. Thus to represent the tables for each doc-
ument, only counts for the number of tables, 𝑚, allocated to each cluster are needed.
This can be used to sample the stick-breaking weights 𝛽 for each cluster. Data points
can then be directly allocated to clusters instead of needing to be allocated to tables
first. The direct allocation is done via a cluster indicator 𝑧 variable.
1. For each document 𝑖,
a) For each observation 𝑗 in document 𝑖, sample 𝑧𝑖𝑗 for the cluster allocation,
where 𝑛−𝑖𝑗𝑖𝑘 is the number of data points allocated to cluster 𝑘 in document 𝑖
excluding 𝑥𝑖𝑗 ,
𝑝(𝑧𝑖𝑗 = 𝑘|z−𝑖𝑗) ∝
⎧⎪

⎪⎩

𝑘 (𝑥𝑖𝑗), if 𝑘 = 𝑧𝑖 𝑗 for some (𝑖 , 𝑗 ) ≠ (𝑖, 𝑗),
𝜏𝛽new𝑓new(𝑥𝑖𝑗), if 𝑘 = 𝑘new.
(4.25)
This samples the cluster allocation proportional to the number of existing
data points allocated to the cluster plus a pseudo-count representing the
prior probability of selecting a new table that is allocated to that cluster
(𝜏𝛽𝑘). If a new cluster 𝑘new is sampled during one of the steps above, then
draw 𝑏 ∼ Beta(1, 𝛾), set the new weight 𝛽𝑘new = 𝑏𝛽new and set the new 𝛽new to
(1 − 𝑏)𝛽new. 𝑏 corresponds to the weight of the new atom that is instantiated
from the DP.
b) Sample 𝑚𝑖𝑘, where 𝑘 ranges over the clusters, by generating 𝑛𝑖𝑘 uniformly
distributed random variables 𝑢1, … , 𝑢𝑛𝑖𝑘 in [0, 1], and setting:
𝑚𝑖𝑘 =
𝑛𝑖𝑘
𝑚=1
𝟏 𝑢𝑚 ≥
𝜏𝛽𝑘
𝜏𝛽𝑘 + 𝑚
(4.26)
where 𝟏 is the indicator function. Intuitively this is sampling the number of
document-level clusters by counting howmany new document-level clusters
would be needed using the Chinese restaurant process. This is calculated for
all the data points for each document that are assigned to each corpus-level
cluster.
4.6 53
This gives the following distribution (Antoniak, 1974), where 𝑠(𝑚, 𝑛) are
unsigned Stirling numbers of the first kind,
𝑝(𝑚𝑖𝑘 = 𝑚|z,m−𝑖𝑘, 𝜷) =
Γ(𝜏𝛽𝑘)
Γ(𝜏𝛽𝑘 + 𝑛𝑖𝑘)
𝑠(𝑛𝑖𝑘, 𝑚)(𝜏𝛽𝑘)𝑚. (4.27)
2. Sample 𝜷 as in (4.22).
4.5.3 Parameter op misa on
I use Gamma priors for the concentration parameters 𝜏 and 𝛾 and sample from their
posteriors every iteration as part of Gibbs sampling by the auxiliary variable method
(Escobar andWest, 1995) as described in Section 3.8.4 and Section 3.8.7. I estimatedthe
parameters of the base distributions over topics via a fixed-point method (Minka, 2000),
which results in Dirichlet parameters that correspond to the frequently used TF-IDF
measure weighing rare words more heavily. However, that did not perform as well as
using a symmetric base distribution. I use an uninformative symmetric prior for the
𝑛-grams.
4.6
In comparison with the author-topic model described in Section 3.6, the author-topic
space model for disambiguation has a number of advantages. Chief among these is that
a training set is not needed and that the real authors of the documents do not need
to be known. As a result, a nonparametric model is needed to model the unknown
number of authors that exist in an unseen dataset. In addition, the author-topic space
model has no explicit model of author names so authors with slight differences in names
cannot be handled without preprocessing. My model can take into account changes at
the character level to author names so is more tolerant with regard to errors in author
fields. Since the 𝑛-gram based author name likelihood has a conjugate prior, inference
in the model is simpler than more complex name models.
The association of authors with topics are also handled differently in the two models.
The author-topic model associates authors with a distribution over topics whereas the
model described in this chapter associates each author with a unique topic. Modelling
an author as being associated with a range of topics results in a broader distribution
over the vocabulary, in contrast to modelling an author with a single topic. This broader
distribution would likely make it harder for authors to be disambiguated on the basis of
4.6 54
any distinctive vocabulary they use in documents. Modelling an author with a unique
topic also prevents an author from being allocated to function word topics. These topics
are ones that mostly contain words that are shared amongst almost all documents in the
corpus and no are not useful for discriminating between them. The author-topic model
does not explicitly model these words and so it is possible for function word topics to
be assigned to authors and so overweight authors which are prolific in the corpus.
Compared to the LDA-ER and similar models for citation matching described in
Section 2.1.1, the model I developed in this chapter mostly has an advantage in terms
of disambiguation. LDA-ER does not use the text of the document for disambiguation
and so it can be easy for different authors with the same name to be inferred to be the
same entity. LDA-ER also require the prior for the number of authors to be learnt in
advance on a separate training set. The model I described in this chapter samples from
the posterior over the concentration parameters and so a sufficiently broad prior means
those parameters do not need to be learnt from a training set. Finally, LDA-ER uses a
domain specific name variation model with no conjugate prior. The use of the conjugate
prior in my name variation model allows the model parameters to be integrated out so
that mixing is much faster. Their name variation model is also only for author names
while the 𝑛-gram model used in my model can be used for any string that becomes
corrupted or has variation at the character level such as titles, addresses or dates.
Finally, parallels can be drawn between my model and the Gaussian-multinomial
LDA (GM-LDA) model of David M. Blei and Jordan (2003). The goal of the GM-LDA
model is associating different regions in an imagewith words in the image caption. Each
word or region in an image is allocated to a cluster where the cluster for both types of
data points is chosen from a multinomial distribution. The model I described in this
chapter can be thought of as a similar model where the image regions are replaced with
author names and image captions with document text. My model is similar in that the
true cluster for the image regions and the image captions are unknown unlike in the
author-topic model or LDA-ER model. However, they focus on using their model to
model the probability of the caption given a set of regions whereas the focus in my
model is on disambiguating a set of authors rather than modelling text. They also use
a simple Gaussian model for the image regions rather than the string-level variation
model I use for author names. Additionally, their model requires specifying the number
of topics in advance since it is a parametric model.

4.7.1 B3 metric
The approach most commonly used for evaluation in coreference resolution is the B3
scoring algorithm (Bagga and Baldwin, 1998a). This algorithm can be used to calculate
precision and recall based on the presence or absence of authors in the equivalence class
of author entities averaged across all the author entities. The B3 algorithmwas proposed
as an alternative to the MUC algorithm for scoring clusters. An important reason is that
the B3 algorithm gives credit for separating singletons compared with pairwise scoring
or similar methods. The scoring algorithm is defined as follows where an entity in this
case refers to an instance of an author name:
• For each entity 𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑁 , let
– nCE be the number of correct entities in the cluster containing entity 𝑖,
– nE be the number of entities in the cluster containing entity 𝑖,
– nTE be the number of entities in the true cluster containing entity 𝑖,
– Precision𝑖 = nCEnE ,
– Recall𝑖 = nCEnTE .
• Then
– B3 precision = 1𝑁 ∑𝑁𝑖=1 Precision𝑖,
– B3 recall = 1𝑁 ∑𝑁𝑖=1 Recall𝑖.
For example, suppose author Al appeared in a corpus 4 times with the names Al,
Ai, Aj and A1 along with other authors. Then imagine that the output of the algorithm
was 2 clusters, one with the names Al, Ai, Aj and Bal and the other with just A1. The
calculation for the first entity Alwould be: 𝑛𝐶𝐸 = 3, 𝑛𝐸 = 4, 𝑛𝑇𝐸 = 4. So precision𝑖 =
3/4 = 75% and recall𝑖 = 3/4 = 75% for this entity. The B3 precision and B3 recall is
then the average of the individual recall and precisions for each of the other 5 entities:
Al, Ai, Aj, A1, Bal.
The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall: 2 precision⋅recallprecision+recall .
4.7.2 Pairwise clustering score
The pairwise clustering score is also used to evaluate clusterings by examining pairs of
author names that are clustered together.
4.8 56
For each possible pair of observed author names, where the true cluster is the true
author entity, define:
• 𝑎, the number of author pairs that are in the same cluster and the same true cluster,
• 𝑏, the number of author pairs that are in the same cluster and different true
clusters,
• 𝑐, the number of author pairs that are in different clusters but the same true cluster,
• 𝑑, the number of author pairs that are in different clusters and different true
clusters.
Then
• Recall = 𝑎𝑎+𝑐 ,
• Precision = 𝑎𝑎+𝑏 .
The F1 score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall as above: 2 precision⋅recallprecision+recall .
4.8
I used a set of documents from the CiteSeer database that have been hand labelled
with ground truth identities for the authors. This is a citation database which contains
papers on various computer science topics, often the papers and paper metadata are
extracted from scanned-in versions of the physical documents. The dataset includes
author names, some of which are corrupted due to errors in the OCR process. I re-
moved punctuation and other non alphanumeric characters from the documents. The
dataset was created by Giles, Bollacker and Lawrence (1998) and cleaned by Bhat-
tacharya and Getoor (2006). I retrieved the abstracts for each of the documents in the
dataset from the CiteSeer database. This set of documents contains 852 documents, 867
unique names, 706 underlying author entities and 1,680 author references. The abstracts
contain 42,507 words with a vocabulary size of 5,695 words. This is the same dataset
used in one of the experiments in Chapter 5. The words are lowercased, stemmed and
a standard stoplist is applied*. The 10 words appearing in the most documents are dis-
carded since these are usually function words or words that are standard to the domain
of the corpus. The 𝑛-grams extracted from author names are lowercased and include
beginning and end of name markers. These markers allow 𝑛-grams at the ends of a
name to be distinguished from those in the middle of a name.

Since the CiteSeer dataset has very little ambiguity and most of the authors can be
identified by an exact string match on their name, I created another separate dataset
where some of the authors are conflated together. This was done by discarding the last
names of the authors in the CiteSeer dataset. The process resulted in a dataset with 362
unique names or roughly 2 author entities for every unique author name. I will refer to
this as the ‘conflated CiteSeer dataset’.
The results of the experiments were evaluated with the commonly used B3 algorithm,
described in Section 4.7.1, used to evaluate coreference resolution systems. Ground
truth is available for the CiteSeer dataset and the scores are measured against that
ground truth.
I performed experiments with the two inference algorithms, the CRF sampler and the
direct sampler to compare their performance and convergence speed. These samplers
were used to infer the author entities and topics in the corpus. Each author and word was
initialised in its own cluster. The concentration parameter for the symmetric Dirichlet
prior for the 𝑛-gram distributions was fixed at 10−9 for the generative bigrammodel and
0.001 for the BOW trigram model, found from optimising the B3 F1 score by testing
different orders of magnitudes for the concentration parameter on 10% of the dataset.
The parameter for the symmetric Dirichlet prior for the topics, 𝛼𝑤, was set to 0.01 in
common with the author-topic model and other topic models. A Gamma(0.4, 0.0002)
prior was placed on the initial concentration parameters for the DP 𝛾 and a Gamma(1, 1)
prior on 𝜏. The concentration parameters were then sampled from their posteriors dur-
ing every iteration. The standard vague prior was used for 𝜏 because there are likely
to be very few tables or document-level clusters per document as many of the data
points in a document are expected to belong to the same cluster. Changing the prior
parameters by an order of magnitude do not significantly affect the results. The prior
for 𝛾 was found by minimising the KL-distance between the number of prior clusters
and a uniform distribution as in Section 3.8.4, seen in Figure 4.2b. Using a standard
Gamma(1, 1) prior for 𝛾 produced poorer results with lower precision since there is
a very high prior probability of having very few clusters as seen in Figure 4.2a. This
causes data points to be heavily overclustered so somewhat reduces the deduplication
performance as measured by F1 by a few percent and causes unrelated data points to
be clustered together. The prior effectively puts an unreasonable assumption for the
number of author identities.
Experiments were run on the remaining held-out dataset with the algorithms im-
plemented in C++. The diagnostic methods by Gelman and Rubin described in Sec-
tion 3.4.1 were used to assess whether the Markov chains have converged.

Results were collected after 100,000 iterations of sampling. This appears to be suffi-
cient for the direct sampler from examining the Gelman-Rubin potential scale reduction
factor (PSRF) plots for various posterior quantities including the number of entities, the
number of topics, the size of the biggest cluster, the hyperparameter values and the B3
and pairwise scores. These plots are in Figure 4.3. The plots show that using the dir-
ect sampler, the PSRF for the B3 F1 score appears to converge by 5,000 iterations as
it is close to 1.0, however, after that the PSRF grows to be 2.4 at 100,000 iterations.
This shows that the chains will have falsely appeared to converge if less than 10,000
iterations have been performed, which is typical in other experiments.
On the other hand for the CRF sampler in Figure 4.3, there is a similar dip in PSRF
at around 7,000 iterations, however, the PSRF grows and then declines to be around 1.5
at 100,000 iterations. This indicates that the CRF sampler is converging faster than the
direct sampler. An explanation for this is that since the global random measure 𝐺0 is
integrated out in the CRF sampler rather than sampled, the chain can mix faster. This
could be because the weights in 𝐺0 are only sampled after a round of sampling the
entity indicators for the corpus. Since the data points in the corpus can be frequently
reassigned, this slow updating of 𝐺0 can slow down the mixing of the chain.
Even though the PSRF for the B3 scores shows the chains have not fully converged
by 100,000 iterations, the trace plot in Figure 4.3 shows that running the sampler for
more iterations only improves performance by 0.5% in terms of the B3 F1 score. Thus,
due to the long time required for such long simulations, the results are given are for
chains that are run for 100,000 iterations. Using different initial states where the words
are all allocated to one entity cluster or all to individual clusters also resulted in very
similar results after 100,000 iterations showing that the initial state is not important.
4.8.1 Cita on dataset
The density of some of the main posterior quantities for the direct sampler across the
second half of 5 chains are shown in Figure 4.4. The densities are generally unimodal
and the density for the scores are generally Gaussian showing that the chains havemixed
well.
The performance of each inferencemethod on the CiteSeer dataset is given in Table 4.1.
The models generally have slightly higher scores when using the CRF sampler. This
can be explained by the faster convergence of the chains in the CRF sampler so that
they are less affected by the initialisation of the sampler. The difference, however, is
very small, and the increase in computation time and inference complexity is signific-

The slower convergence of the direct sampler is somewhat surprising since, in the
CRF sampler, the sampling between documents is coupled together. This means that
the allocation of entities in a given document is dependent on the counts for tables in
other documents being assigned to entities. However, one benefit is that the data points
on a table can all be reassigned to a different entity in one step, and this allows for larger
4.8 68
moves in the state space than the individual reallocations in the direct sampler. On the
other hand, the coupled sampling in the CRF sampler makes it difficult to extend the
model whereas sampling from 𝐺0 allows for more flexible models in the future. The
CRF also takes significantly more CPU time per iteration due to the extra level of latent
variables it needs to sample.
The generative bigrammodel for the author names has a significantly better B3 preci-
sion score than the BOW trigrams model, and this is likely due to the generative model
being more restrictive in terms of the name variants that can be assigned to a single
entity. As a result there is less overclustering and so the generative bigram model has a
more reasonable number of inferred author entities. Another contribution to the higher
precision score is that the generative bigram model is a better model for character se-
quences as it takes account of the marginal frequencies of each letter. On the other hand,
since the trigram concentration parameter is much higher than the bigram one, there is
more smoothing occurring in the BOW trigrammodel. Hence, the BOW trigrammodel
has a higher recall score though at a large cost to precision.
The BOW trigram model slightly outperforms the generative bigram model using
pairwise scoring where larger clusters have a much bigger impact on the score than
smaller clusters. Since author entities with many observed name variants must author
more documents, the lower recall score for the generative bigram model has a larger
effect when using pairwise scoring. This allows the BOW trigram model to have a
significantly better recall recall so that its F1 score is higher than that of the generative
bigram model.
Due to the better precision, there are more entities in the posterior of the generative
bigram model than in the BOW trigram model. During training I also observed even
with a range of magnitudes for the trigram concentration parameter, the precision for
the BOW trigrammodel never reached that for the generativemodel. I also found during
training that compared with the BOW trigram model, the generative bigram model is
much less sensitive to the concentration parameter. Setting the concentration parameter
to other values within two orders of magnitude did not significantly affect the results
whereas the results for the BOW trigram model rapidly degraded within one order of
magnitude.
Since the CiteSeer dataset contains very few ambiguous names in that the vast ma-
jority of identical names refer to only one entity, it is expected that my model does not
have a very high precision score. Since I use a uniform prior distribution for the number
of clusters, identical names will occasionally be split up into multiple entities because
of a strong association with their topics. This effect can be varied by adjusting the prior
for 𝛾 , which controls the number of clusters across the corpus. In the CiteSeer dataset,
4.8 69
the majority of authors are singleton authors so clustering any of those with another
author would lower the precision score. The size of each document can cause author
entities to be associated with highly popular topics depending on how well represented
an author is in the dataset. As a result, authors that have been associated with popu-
lar topics could be more likely to be assigned to other documents’ author fields even
if they do not share many 𝑛-grams. This is a result of the Dirichlet process prior and
likelihood weighting the words and author names equally for each author entity cluster.
This implies that the words and author names need to be weighted separately instead
of jointly to prevent the likelihood of the words dominating that of the author names in
the author entity clusters.
The results can be compared against a simple baseline of using exact string match to
assign identical author names to the same author entity. The results of an exact string
match and the leading LDA-ER model applied to this Citeseer dataset can be seen in
Table 4.2. This shows that the bigram model improves on the exact string match model
whereas the trigram model doesn’t. This is also likely due to the generative bigram
model being a better model for name variation than the BOW trigram model. The
However, even though the bigram and trigram models approach the performance of
LDA-ER, since neither of them use the domain specific name variation model in LDA-
ER they are not able to outperform it. I also performed preliminary experiments using
a simple baseline of clustering together names that were similar to each other by edit
distance within a certain threshold and found that this also didn’t perform as well as the
generative name variation model.
My model successfully assigns similar names to the same cluster along with a reas-
onable topic as seen in Table 4.3. The table also shows the five words that are most
allocated to each entity. Each author entity (separated by a horizontal line) is repres-
ented by a set of author names and words from the dataset. The names have various
errors such as a word being separated into two words when the small space between
characters is detected by an OCR algorithm as a full space. The topic that is inferred
for each author contains some function words that are not usually specific to a field
such as recognize, study and achieve. However, the author might prefer to use these
words to describe their findings over other more general function words so it may help
in disambiguating the author. Some words that are specific to the author’s field also
appear prominently in the author’s topic such as database, dynamic and vector, which
can disambiguate authors that work in different fields.
Below is an example of author/topic assignments to an abstract authored by David
Poole, Randy Goebel and Romas Aleliunas in the CiteSeer dataset. Each of the authors
in the author fieldswas allocated to the correct entity. These allocations are from a single

We provide3 an introduction1 to Theorist1, a logic1 programming1 system
that uses a uniform2 deductive3 reasoning1 mechanism1 to construct1 ex-
planations3 of observations3 in terms1 of facts1 and hypotheses1. Observa-
tions3, facts1, and possible hypotheses1 are each sets1 of logical1 formulas1
that represent1, respectively, a set3 of observations3 on a partial3 domain3,
a set3 of facts1 for which the domain3 is a model1, and a set3 of tentative3
hypotheses1 which may be required1 to provide3 a consistent1 explanation3
of the observations3. Theorist1 has been designed3 to reason3 in a fash-
ion3 similar1 to how we reason3 with and construct1 scientific3 theories1.
Rather than monotonically1 deduce3 theorems1 from a fixed3 logical1 the-
ory1, theorist1 distinguishes3 facts1 from hypotheses1 and attempts3 to use
deduction1 to construct1 consistent1 theories1 for which the observations3
are logical1 consequences1. A prototype1, implemented4 inProlog1, demon-
strates3 how diagnosis2, default1 reasoning1, and a kind3 of learning4 can
all be based4 on the Theorist1 framework.
The text indicated with a superscript 1 is assigned to the same cluster as the first
author who has the inferred name variants David Poole, D. Poole. The text indicated
with a superscript 2 is assigned to the same cluster as the second author who has the
inferred name variants: R. Goebel, Randy Goebel. The text indicated with a superscript
3 is assigned to the same cluster as the third author who has the inferred name variants:
R. Aleliunas, Romas Aleliunas. Finally, the text indicated with a superscript 4 is as-
signed to a cluster that does not appear in the author list and who has the name: F. Rossi.
The assignment of words to these clusters indicate that these are function words in this
document, especially since the words implemented, learning, based likely appear fre-
quently throughout this computer-science based corpus. The unlabelled words were
stripped from the dataset, either because they were in the stop word list or they only
appeared in one document.
In this document, Romas Aleliunas writes using general, non topic-specific words
such as provide, set and demonstrates. However, since he only authors one other docu-
ment in this corpus, the posterior distribution for his topic is quite broad and tends to be
over more general areas of expertise. This can be seen in Table 4.4. On the other hand,
David Poole’s topic in this document is specialised as he writes about them in three
other papers in the corpus. This seems a good indication of a topic that he specialises
on. His homepage indicates that he works on knowledge representation, computational
logic, reasoning about actions, similar to the inferred topic in his cluster. F. Rossi, who
is not an actual author of the paper but is allocated to some of the words in the document,
has a topic that is very broad and covers a number of function and general words used
4.8 72
in the corpus such as paper and problems. This is because his topic is the topic that is
allocated to the most words in the corpus. Thus in this sample and in other documents,
his topic serves as a function word topic that is allocated to words that are not specific-
ally related to the topics of the authors for the document. Ideally, this function word
topic would only be allocated to general function words and would not be allocated
to any authors at all, but building a more complex model with additional restrictions
such as that of David M. Blei and Jordan (2003) may slow down mixing. Instead, it is
reasonable to assume that for a document, words which are allocated to clusters that are
not allocated to any author fields are function words.

appeared in the example CiteSeer abstract. The last row indicates the number of
words allocated to that en ty across the corpus.

Decreasing the 𝛼𝑟 hyperparameter in the Dirichlet base measure prior for the 𝑛-grams
is sufficient to separate out individual author entities into differing clusters. However,
this parameter needs to be tuned to specify how similar two names need to be to likely
correspond to the same author entity. As 𝛼𝑟 → ∞, the probability mass corresponds to
an even proportion of all the different 𝑛-grams since the effect of large counts is reduced
and so a high number of unique 𝑛-grams per entity is favoured. However, when 𝛼𝑟 → 0,
the 𝑛-gram counts are squeezed to become zero or one so increasing the effect of large
counts. This results in the probability mass favouring a few number of unique 𝑛-grams
per author entity. As a result, decreasing 𝛼𝑟 increases the similarity needed between two
strings to be assigned to the same author entity (i.e. Manuela M. Veloso and Manuela
Veloso would not be allocated to the same entity) whereas increasing 𝛼𝑟 lowers the
4.8 73
similarity (i.e. Robert Veloso andManuela Velosomay be allocated to the same entity).
In the given results, 𝛼𝑟 is tuned on 10% of the dataset.
Reducing the base DP concentration parameter 𝛾 , as described in Section 3.8.4, re-
duces the number of clusters (author entities and topics) and so can allocate names that
are less similar to the same entity. On the other hand, it causes fewer words to be as-
signed to the actual authors of the document and more of them to be treated as function
words, which are assigned to no author.
The document level concentration parameter 𝜏 is important in determining the num-
ber of tables or number of document-level clusters to which a document is assigned.
Ideally, this would be related to the number of real authors in a document. However,
extra clusters are used for allocating function words and words not associated with
any particular author. In general, experiments suggest setting concentration parameters
based on the expected variance for author-topic relationships. For example, to asso-
ciate author entities with more specific topics, 𝛾 should be increased and to associate
author entities with more documents, 𝜏 should be increased. The experiments I per-
formed with the model used only a small portion of the dataset for training the name
variation model and no training was used for the DP concentration parameters, 𝜏 and 𝛾 .
The prior for these concentration parameters were set to result in a relatively uniform
prior distribution for the number of clusters.
When using 𝑛-grams to model author names, some of the names in my corpus are
not clustered correctly. The Dirichlet prior and multinomial likelihood does not capture
some intuitions with name matching. Names which have an abbreviated first name and
especially those which share the same last name, such as I. Fischer and R Fischer have
difficulties in my method and are commonly allocated together even though they are
likely different entities. This is probably a result of R Fischer having many more docu-
ments in the corpus than I. Fischer so I. Fischer has too broad of a topic distribution to
be identified as a separate entity. This could be mitigated by reducing the variance in
the start of name bigrams. An alternative approach is to model the spaces in names sep-
arately and utilise domain knowledge that a name is split up into different parts. Using
a HDP over the full name and the parts of the name is one way to better model the name
variation in different parts of the name. In Section 5.4.2, I describe a domain-specific
name variation that solves some of these problems.
4.8.2 Conflated cita on dataset
The results for the conflated dataset given in Table 4.5 show that the generative bi-
gram model has an even larger improvement over the BOW trigram model than in the
4.9 74
standard CiteSeer dataset. This is because since last names are discarded, the remaining
portion of the name is more important for separating out authors and thus two names
with minor differences are more likely to refer to two entities rather than being two vari-
ants of a given name. In this dataset, the generative bigrammodel performs significantly
better than an exact string match on author names whereas the low precision score for
the BOW trigram model means it is not sufficiently separating out entities based on
author name. The generative bigram model has higher precision than the exact string
match, indicating that topics are successfully being used to separate out authors with
identical names to their real entities. Both the trigram and generative bigram models
have a better pairwise precision and F1 score than the baseline.

bigrammodel. These aremeasured against the conflated CiteSeer dataset. A burn-in
of 5000 itera ons were used and the results from the last 5000 itera ons averaged
together. The number of en es only counts clusters that have authors allocated to
them.

I developed a nonparametric generative Bayesian model, the author-topic space model
for author disambiguation. Although there are related models that deal with cross-field
dependencies, they do not integrate a name variation model with a model of document
text as well as have the benefits of a nonparametric and generative model. This type of
model improves flexibility as the model complexity scales with the size of the dataset
and also potentially allows use of unlabelled data. The model is hierarchical and suc-
ceeds in sharing both topics and their authors among papers. Author entities are inferred
that correspond to real author identities and each entity is matched with a unique topic
4.9 75
or distribution over the vocabulary. This allows authors with distinctive styles of writ-
ing to be disambiguated with the aid of differences in vocabulary in documents. The
model is more general than similar citation matching models by allowing both authors
to have aliases and for authors to have a unique distribution over words in a document.
Experiments performed on a set of papers from CiteSeer with gold-standard hand
annotations used two different Gibbs sampling methods and yielded good results. The
experiments also showed that the CRF sampler, which is a result of integrating out the
global random measure 𝐺0, mixed faster than the direct sampler.
A deficiency of this model is that overclustering occurs due to the author names and
words being equally weighted in the likelihood. The high dimensionality of the words
also result in a much more peaked distribution compared to the authors so that the
words dominate in the posterior. An alternative model where the authors and topics are
generated using different processes is a different approach that would be interesting to
explore, however, sharing and inferring of topics may be more complex in this model.
Simply associating authors with multiple topics would not solve the problem since the
topics would be overweighted relative to the author names.
Another drawback is that the name variation model is restrictive in terms of the de-
grees of name variation it can represent since the namemodel needs to have a conjugate
prior for efficient inference. This makes it difficult to use domain-specific name vari-
ation models, for example, in languages where names are written using a very small
number of symbols from a vast dictionary, such as Chinese, a name variation model
based on the Pinyin or strokes of the name is more appropriate. Modeling a name based
on the different parts of a name separately, such as the first, middle and last name should
also improve performance. The namemodel also cannot represent names where the first
and last names have been switched and other similar problems, which require a more
domain-specific model.
The model is also unable to capture the co-occurrence relationships of document co-
authors, which can be a strong indicator of an author’s identity especially since most
papers have more than one author. For example, a graduate student often writes pa-
pers with their supervisor as a co-author. Finally, the model also requires associating
every word in the corpus with exactly one author. This is needed even when a word is
central to the document and would more accurately be modeled as originating from all
authors of the document or when a word is a stopword and is not predictive of an au-
thor. This contributes to the overclustering problems as described earlier and can also
result in some authors being associated with fewer topics than they should be as they
are underrepresented in the corpus.
4.9 76
I explore a model in Chapter 5 that is better able to associate topics with authors and
addresses some of the drawbacks of the model in this chapter such as the limitations of
the name variation model and name overclustering.
For future work, an extension of themodel tomore accuratelymodel the relationships
between authors in a single document could be to have a DP generate only the primary
author of a document allowing the modelling of common relationships such as student-
supervisor or theorist-experimenter. A more complex model for author names such as a
pair hidden Markov model to model string edit distances (Hall, Sutton and McCallum,
2008) would give a higher degree of control over the author clusters. However, these
models have the cost of not having a conjugate prior so inference would be relatively
inefficient. A dedicated ‘function word’ author could also be added to each document,
which is shared across all documents to explicitly cluster together function words.

THE GROUPED AUTHOR - TOP I C MODE L
In this chapter, I present the necessary changes to the model described in Chapter 4 to
take advantage of author co-occurrence relationships in documents and to better model
author name variants. The new model uses the additional concept of a latent group
that captures correlations among the latent entities. For each document, an abstract and
an author list are generated conditioned on a given group. As in Chapter 4, an author
reference, as it appears in an author list, is an author name that may be a variant of the
full name. An author identity is a real-world individual author and an author entity is
the latent representation of an author identity in the model. The task is then to infer
author entities from a corpus containing documents with author references.
As outlined in Chapter 2, the problem involves associating different references to a
real underlying identity. In the case of a corpus, the references are the literal names in the
author list for each document. The references may be written in differing forms or using
different methods of initialling; thus differing references may refer to the same person
(e.g. C. K. I. Williams or Chris Williams). The references may also have changed when
transliterating from the original language. Finally, there may be typographical errors
in the reference where letters may be exchanged or dropped altogether or misread due
to glyphs. As for ambiguity, identical references may refer to different identities. Many
people have identical names, and since people rarely use unique identifiers on their
papers or homepages, very little information is available to distinguish them.
5.1
The grouped author-topic model I present in this chapter captures author interdepend-
ence relations between authors for each document in a corpus, and models the genera-
tion of words in documents resulting from this authorial structure.
Themodel that I develop in this chapter improves on themodel in Chapter 4 in a num-
ber of ways. It integrates both topic and co-author information for tackling the task of
unsupervised identity resolution. Co-author information is captured through a concept
of research groups that forms part of the generative model. Topics are distributions over
the vocabulary and are described in detail in Section 3.5. Authors and topics are asso-
ciated with the latent research groups. Each research group also has a number of topics
77
5.1 78
on which they write. This integration of both topic and research group information en-
ables improved performance over methods that only consider individual information
sources. I also use a better name variant model and extend the inference algorithm to
handle inference for a wider range of name variant models. Like the model described
in Chapter 4, I make no assumptions regarding the equivalence of authors with names
that have the same transcription in the corpus. It compares well to the state of the art
generative unsupervised models and can both combine different references that refer to
the same identity as well as separate identical references that refer to different identities.
I associate groups of authors, rather than individual authors, with topics and generate
an entire abstract from one group thereby eliminating the difficult problem of matching
authors with topics when data is limited.
The remainder of this chapter is set out as follows. In Sections 5.2 and 5.3, I cover the
details of the nested Dirichlet process (NDP), the extension of it to the hybrid NDP-
HDP and my hierarchical extension of the hybrid NDP-HDP. The NDP (Rodriguez,
Dunson and Gelfand, 2008) and hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP), are both hier-
archical extensions to the Dirichlet process (DP), and enable structured forms of sharing
for grouped data such as documents. Section 3.8 covers the DP and the HDP in more
detail. Section 5.4 develops my framework to tackle this problem with a description of
the generative process. In Section 5.5, I describe inference in this framework. I then
describe results on toy data in Section 5.6.1 and on real world datasets in Section 5.6.2.
I conclude in Section 5.7 with a discussion of the benefits and disadvantages of my
framework.
The generative model I describe in this chapter is based on a hybrid NDP-HDP mix-
ture model. In the context of this entity disambiguation problem, a cluster is a set of
author names that belong to one entity. The DP suits the fact that an author may write
numerous documents in a corpus, and even though a variation of the author’s name
may not have been observed with that author, it should still have non-zero probability.
The HDP then allows entities in each latent group to be shared across the corpus. Two
HDPs are used, one for author entities and one for topics, for each group. This allows
authors to be allocated to entities and words to topics within the same latent group. The
HDP structure with the addition of groups is an extension of the NDP, where a draw
from one DP is used as the distribution over an infinite number of other DPs. With the
NDP, different documents can share the same distribution over author entities (and the
same distribution over topics) whereas in the HDP, different documents would always
have different distributions over entities and topics. Thus the NDP allows additional
clustering at the document level where two documents may come from the same latent
group and so share the same distributions over entities and topics. Finally in the NDP
5.2 79
each author entity can only be a member of one latent group and the hybrid NDP-HDP
removes that restriction.
5.2
Here I set out the nested Dirichlet process (NDP) as proposed by Rodriguez, Dunson
and Gelfand (2008). The nested Dirichlet process is a model for grouped data, such as
documents, and essentially is a hierarchical model that allows different groups of data
to share the same distribution. This avoids the alternatives of assuming each group has
the same distribution or that each group has a different distribution. By avoiding this,
the model allows information to be shared between the groups, similar to the goal of
the hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP). However, in the HDP, groups do not share
distributions only the underlying cluster locations. I will describe the model as applied
to a text corpus throughout to make the explanations clearer. To avoid confusion with
latent groups, each group of data will be referred to as a document. The observations
within each document will be words even though the model can be used with both
discrete and numerical data points.
The HDP uses a corpus-level random measure 𝐺0 that is distributed as a Dirichlet
process. This corpus-level randommeasure is used as the base measure for a document-
level Dirichlet process from which document-level random measures 𝐺𝑖 are drawn for
each document. In the NDP, the document-level random measure 𝐺𝑖 is instead chosen
from an infinite set of random measures 𝐺∗ so that two documents can share the same
random measure.
Assume a set of observations or words 𝑥𝑖𝑗 , where 𝑖 = 1, … , 𝐷 and 𝑗 = 1, … , 𝑁𝑖, are
grouped into 𝐷 documents with words indexed by 𝑗 within documents indexed by 𝑖 and
with 𝑁𝑖 words in document 𝑖. Also assume that the words are exchangeable within each
document. We represent samples from the Dirichlet process in stick-breaking form con-
sisting of masses (weights) and atoms (cluster locations) as described in Section 3.8.2.
5.2 80
Then a set of distributions 𝐹𝑖, where 𝑖 = 1, … , 𝐷, follows a nested Dirichlet process
mixture if
𝑥𝑖𝑗 ∼ 𝐹𝑖 (5.1)

where 𝛼 and 𝛽 are concentration parameters, 𝜃 depends on the application, 𝐻 is the base
measure and𝐰, 𝐮,𝝆, 𝐯 are positive randomvariables and correspond toweights from the
stick-breaking process. From the stick-breaking process, ∑∞𝑠=1 𝑤𝑘𝑠 = 1 and ∑∞𝑘=1 𝜌𝑘 =
1. For each cluster 𝑠, the parameters 𝜙𝑠 determine the distribution of words from that
cluster. Given a cluster, 𝜃 is the parameter for the distribution of each word and is equal
to one of the 𝜙. For example, in a model for continuous observations instead of words,
themodel for the observations could be aGaussian distributionwith unknownmean and
variance where 𝑝(⋅|𝜃) = N(⋅|𝜇, 𝜎2) and 𝜃 = (𝜇, 𝜎). 𝐻 could then be a Gaussian-inverse-
gamma distribution. In topic modeling, each cluster is referred to as a topic, which is
essentially a multinomial distribution over the vocabulary. The graphical model is given
in Figure 5.1.
As a result ℙ(𝐺𝑖 = 𝐺𝑖 ) = 1/(1 + 𝛼) > 0 so the probability of two documents
sharing a distribution over clusters or topics is non-zero. Any two documents which
don’t share that distribution also don’t share any of the topics. This induces clustering
in the distributions for documents, when 𝐺𝑖 = 𝐺𝑖 for some 𝑖 and 𝑖 . In contrast to the
NDP model, in the HDP model, each document has its own distribution over topics

where the topics are shared between all the documents and there is no latent structure
to model the case when two documents share the same distribution over topics.
The marginal distribution for the words in each document can be seen to be 𝐺𝑖 ∼
DP(𝛽𝐻). In the context of the grouped author-topic model, the structure that is induced
by the NDP where two documents share the same distribution over topics is advant-
ageous as it can model the case where two documents originate from the same research
group, where a research group is a distribution over topics.
The set 𝐺𝑖, where 𝑖 = 1, … , 𝐷, which is the mixing distribution, follows a NDP with
parameters 𝛼, 𝛽 and 𝐻 which is written as nDP(𝛼, 𝛽, 𝐻). * The above model can thus
be rewritten as
𝑥𝑖𝑗 ∼ 𝑝(𝑥𝑖𝑗|𝜃𝑖𝑗) (5.10)
𝜃𝑖𝑗 ∼ 𝐺𝑖 (5.11)
{𝐺1, … , 𝐺𝐷} ∼ nDP(𝛼, 𝛽, 𝐻). (5.12)
We say that two documents 𝑖 and 𝑖 are members of the same clusterwhen 𝐺𝑖 = 𝐺𝑖 =
𝐺∗𝑘 in (5.3) for some 𝑘 so that two documents 𝑖 and 𝑖 share the same distribution and

are allocated to the same latent cluster 𝑘. Two words 𝑥𝑖𝑗 and 𝑥𝑖 𝑗 are members of the
same cluster when 𝐺𝑖 = 𝐺𝑖 = 𝐺∗𝑘 and 𝜃𝑖𝑗 = 𝜃𝑖 𝑗 = 𝜙𝑙𝑘 in (5.11) for some 𝑙 so that the
words 𝑥𝑖𝑗 and 𝑥𝑖 𝑗 share the same distribution and are allocated to the same lower-level
latent cluster 𝑙 in latent cluster 𝑘. The first type of cluster of documents is referred to as
the distributional cluster and the second type of cluster of words as the observational
cluster in Rodriguez, Dunson and Gelfand (2008). In the following descriptions, I refer
to distributional clusters as research groups and observational clusters as topics to put
them in the context of the author-topic modeling problem.
5.2.1 Issues during inference
The NDP only allows words to be members of the same cluster when their respective
documents are clustered together. This creates problems for inference and restricts the
models that can be used to those where clusters need to be partitioned and separated. For
inference, this means that when sampling the research group allocation for a document,
the topic allocations for all the words within that document must be re-sampled. This
is because observational clusters are restricted to one research group. In the grouped
author-topic model, this would mean that a topic in the corpus could only be associated
with at most one research group, which is a very limiting assumption.
This assumption can slow down mixing and result in a high number of topics since
they will be partitioned into different research groups. In addition, many of the top-
ics may be very similar, as the partitioning induced by the research groups prevents
the sharing of information between the topics. As a result, a standard collapsed Gibbs
sampler is inefficient and instead truncated sampling must be used.
Truncation approximates a DP using a finite-mixture approximation of the Dirichlet
process. Truncation puts an upper limit on the number of clusters in the Dirichlet pro-
cess model so that as long as the posterior number of clusters does not approach that
limit, a good approximation to the posterior can be inferred. The good approximation
is a result of the geometric drop in cluster weights from the stick-breaking process. The
posterior under the truncation converges in distribution to the true posterior as the up-
per limit tends to infinity. In the NDP, there are two levels of clusters, and for inference
to be tractable, the research groups must be truncated. This is called a top-level trun-
cation and results in replacing (5.3) with 𝐺𝑖(⋅) ∼ ∑𝐾𝑘=1 𝜌𝑘𝛿𝐺∗𝑘(⋅) for finite 𝐾 . As long
as 𝐾 is chosen to be significantly higher than the number of research groups then a
good approximation will result. The topics can also be truncated to improve inference
performance further. A problem with truncated sampling, however, is that it can be
difficult to choose the correct truncation levels (𝐾) in advance.

In this section, I describe the hybrid NDP-HDP, which generalises upon the NDP. This
idea was briefly mentioned in comments made by Lancelot on Rodriguez, Dunson and
Gelfand (2008). The hybrid NDP-HDP model allows topics to be members of multiple
research groups. This allows for a wider range of models as any words in the whole
corpus can be members of the same topics. It also allows for simpler inference with
collapsed Gibbs sampling without the need for truncation. This is all achieved by using
a draw from a Dirichlet process as the base measure in the NDP. In stick-breaking form,
the model is
𝐹𝑖(⋅) = 𝑝(⋅|𝜃) d𝐺𝑖(𝜃) (5.13)
𝐺𝑖 ∼

𝑠=1
(1 − 𝑣𝑠) (5.22)
𝑣𝑘 ∼ Beta(1, 𝛼) (5.23)
where 𝛼, 𝛽 and 𝛾 are concentration parameters and 𝐻 is the base measure. With respect
to the NDP, the changes to the formulas are in (5.15) and the additional (5.16) used
5.3 - 84
to allow topics to be members of multiple research groups. There are also additional
stick-breaking weights (𝝅 and 𝐯∗) for each of these topics across the corpus so that
∑∞𝑠=1 𝜋𝑠 = 1. The changes for the weights are in (5.17), (5.18), (5.19) and (5.21).
The above can be rewritten concisely without using stick-breaking weights as
𝐺∗0 ∼ DP(𝛾, 𝐻) (5.24)
{𝐺1, … , 𝐺𝐷} ∼ nDP(𝛼, 𝛽, 𝐺∗0) (5.25)
Since the atoms 𝜙 in 𝐺∗𝑘 are limited to those in 𝐺∗0 , words in two documents can still
be members of the same topic even if the documents are members of different research
groups. In essence, topics can be members of multiple research groups. Documents are
clustered together when 𝐺𝑖 = 𝐺𝑖 = 𝐺∗𝑠 for some 𝑠 so that the two documents 𝑖 and 𝑖
share the same distribution and are allocated to the same research group 𝑠. The words
𝑥𝑖𝑗 and 𝑥𝑖 𝑗 can be clustered together when 𝜃𝑖𝑗 = 𝜃𝑖 𝑗 = 𝜙𝑘 for some 𝑘 so that the words
share the same distribution and are assigned to the same topic 𝑘, even if their documents
are not clustered together. The indicators 𝑔𝑖 = 𝑠 and 𝑧𝑖𝑗 = 𝑘 will be used when 𝐺𝑖 = 𝐺∗𝑠
and 𝜃𝑖𝑗 = 𝜙𝑘 respectively to indicate cluster membership during inference. A cluster
then consists of documents with identical 𝑔𝑖 values or words with identical 𝑧𝑖𝑗 values.
Research groups will also be referred to as latent groups in the remainder of the chapter.
5.3.1 Hierarchical extension
Finally, I propose a hierarchical extension to the hybrid NDP-HDP that can model a
document as a mixture of research groups. A hierarchical structure can be used not only
for the base measure of the nested Dirichlet process but also for the random measure
over the documents. In this case, a document is associated with a mixture of research
groups and allows for an even more flexible clustering. Each word is allocated to both
5.3 - 85
a research group and a topic. Briefly, in stick-breaking form without writing out the
weights, this model is written as
𝐺𝑖 =
∞
𝑘=1
𝜓𝑖𝑘𝛿𝐺∗𝑘 (5.26)
𝐺0 =
∞
𝑘=1
𝜌𝑘𝛿𝐺∗𝑘 (5.27)
𝐺∗𝑘 =
∞
𝑠=1
𝑤𝑘𝑠𝛿𝜙𝑠 (5.28)
𝐺∗0 =
∞
𝑠=1
𝜋𝑠𝛿𝜙𝑠 (5.29)
where the additional stick-breakingweights 𝜓 are defined similarly to (5.20). Compared
to the hybrid NDP-HDP, there is an additional corpus-level DP 𝐺0 and corresponding
changes to the model in (5.26) and (5.27). The graphical model is given in Figure 5.2.
To generate each observation in a document, first a research group is sampled and
then a topic is sampled conditional on the research group; finally the observation is
sampled given the topic’s parameters. Allowing a document to be allocated to multiple
research groups allows the document to have a broader distribution over observations by
combining the different research groups. This can be useful when it may not be the case
that a single research group is sufficient to model all the observations in a document.
5.3.2 Summary
In summary, the HDP, NDP, hybrid NDP-HDP and hierarchical extension to the HDP-
NDP are all models for grouped data and exhibit different sharing properties. The sim-
ilarities and differences between the mixture models can be seen more clearly through
thinking of the topics (atoms or cluster centres) and weights (cluster weights) that are
being shared.
For a corpus of documents, each document consists of a variable number of words.
The words in each document arise from a mixture, and so each word is allocated to a
topic. The distribution of the document can then be thought of as a series of topics and
weights from which the observations in the document arise.
Table 5.1 compares and contrasts the HDP and NDP mixture models and their ex-
tensions.
The model I describe in Section 5.4 is a model based on the hybrid NDP-HDP mix-
ture model with modifications for author-topic modelling with latent groups. The main

change is for modelling the two types of observations, words and authors, by mirroring
the NDP-HDP structure. This model’s graphical model is Figure 5.4b. I also perform
experiments with my hierarchical extension to the hybrid NDP-HDP mixture model
where a document is allocated to multiple research groups and group allocations are
made at the word level. This model’s graphical model is Figure 5.4a.
5.4 -
In this chapter, I aim to use as much of the commonly-shared information as possible
that is available for the purposes of entity resolution. This information is typically the
words in a title and abstract, as well as the author lists. This information is organised
via the concept of a research group (which characterises which authors might be co-
authors) along with topic information associated with each group (which helps disam-
biguate authors which could be members of a number of research groups). This leads
to a model which I call the grouped author-topic model. The rest of this chapter will
refer to a latent group of authors and topics as a group.
Each real-world author identity will be represented by a latent author entity. Al-
though a single entity, a real-world author may have a number of different names by
which he or she is referred. These are known as references or variants, as described in
Chapter 4. Different variants of the author’s name occur due to variation in initialling,
transcription errors, typographical errors, transliteration differences etc. These varying
forms can be viewed as being generated by a name variation process which, for each
author, modifies an underlying canonical name associated with that particular author.
I tested a nonparametric generative 𝑛-gram model and a bag-of-words 𝑛-gram model
in Chapter 4, and in this chapter, I test a previously-used domain-specific name vari-
ation model (Bhattacharya and Getoor, 2006). This is a string metric based model that
uses domain knowledge that author names are often written with first or middle names
initialled or middle name removed to calculate the probability of a name corruption or
name variant.
5.4.1 Combining modali es using groups
The problem being tackled is an unsupervised problem, and we wish to combine dif-
ferent modalities of data (author name and topics). Hence we need to combine the like-
lihood of the author entities with the likelihoods of the topics. This makes the prob-
lem similar to that of image annotation (David M. Blei and Jordan, 2003) in which the
problem is to combine image region and topic likelihoods in the same model. However,
5.4 - 89
models such as the author-topic model and the model in Chapter 4 are models where
entities are directly assigned to individual words in a document. This causes problems
in these models because in the posterior distribution of the authors, authors that are
assigned to many words will have a posterior that tends to be dominated by the topic
assignments. As a result, the evidence from the author names themselves is missed.
I explore several models for reducing the effect of abstract length on authors in Sec-
tion 5.4.3. The models explored in this chapter also allow the posterior distribution over
entities conditional on the group to be independent of the length of text in each docu-
ment. This is a result of associating topics with groups rather than individual entities.
An alternative model is to have topics be associated with entities and entities be
associated with groups. Since this model uses DPs where the cluster weights are inde-
pendent of whether the observation is a word or an author, known as single-𝑝 dependent
DPs, the posterior weight of an entity will be equally affected by the likelihood of all
observations rather than just those associated with authors or just words (Griffin and
Steel, 2006; MacEachern, 1999). The result of this is that the word counts in the pos-
terior would be overweighted relative to the author counts, and so topics would have an
overly large effect compared with author names for the entities.
5.4.2 Name varia on model
The domain-specific name variation model (Bhattacharya and Getoor, 2006) is sim-
ilar to a string metric and calculates the probability of one string being transformed
from another string. The model uses domain knowledge that names are commonly
split into three different parts (first, middle and last name) and that the first and middle
names are often initialled to assign different errors in different parts of the name varying
levels of significance. This ensures a better model of author name variation than simple
string based methods that do not distinguish name parts, such as the ones described in
Chapter 4.
The model gives the probability of an author’s canonical or full name being trans-
formed to a reference name. In this model, first, middle and last names are assumed to
be independent. The first name is initialled with probability 𝑝FI, missing with probab-
ility 𝑝FD and fully kept with probability 𝑝FR where 𝑝FI + 𝑝FD + 𝑝FR = 1 and similarly
for the middle name. The first and middle initials can also have the wrong initials with
a certain probability. Since the last name is always present, it is modelled by charac-
ters being inserted with probability 𝑝I, replaced with probability 𝑝R and deleted with
probability 𝑝D. The minimum number of character insertions, 𝑛I, replacements, 𝑛R, and
deletions, 𝑛D, needed to transform the author’s canonical name to the reference name
5.4 - 90
is calculated using a minimum edit distance algorithm. The probability of the author’s
referenced name given the author’s canonical name is then 𝑝𝑛II 𝑝
𝑛R
R 𝑝
𝑛D
D .
Compared to the name variant models in Chapter 4, this domain-specific model does
not have a conjugate prior so inference is more complicated. This model is also domain-
specific whereas the string-based models can be used in a wide range of areas.
5.4.3 Model descrip on
To describe the model I need to introduce two concepts, that of group and that of topic.
The idea of topic is described in Section 3.5, where a topic is a mixture component
defining a distribution of words. The content of an individual abstract will only contain
a small number of topics out of the total possible number. Intuitively, the idea of a group
conceptualises authors who work/publish together and the associated topics on which
they publish. The number and frequency of each group is not fixed but is given by a
stick breaking prior from the GEM distribution, which is defined in Section 3.8.2.
For each particular group, we sample from a Dirichlet process over author entities
(to capture the authors that work together), and over topics (to capture the topics the
group publishes on). This Dirichlet process is hierarchical with a base measure based
on a draw from a global author and topic DP. Hence author entities and topics can be
shared between groups so that an author entity has non-zero probability of occurring
in multiple groups, and similarly for the topics.
The grouped author-topic model can be written in stick-breaking form and is given
as a graphical model in Figure 5.4b.

the groups and 𝐺𝑔 is the mixing distribution for document 𝑔. 𝐸 and 𝑇 denote the ran-
5.4 - 91
dommeasures for the entities and topics respectively. 𝐻𝑎 denotes the base measure over
the author entities and 𝐻𝑤 denotes the base measure over topics. The correspondence
between this model and the hybrid NDP-HDP can be seen by matching up the formulas,
(5.30a,b) matches with (5.17), (5.31a,b) matches with (5.16), (5.32a,b) matches with
(5.15) and (5.33) matches with (5.14).
To complete the generative model, I need to describe the process of generating the
actual abstracts. Each abstract is associated with a group (again drawn from a multi-
nomial drawn from the group-level random measure). The group associated with the
document is used to determine which authors are potentially represented in a document
and which topics are written about (i.e. those given significant probability by the as-
sociated group). Intuitively, this can be thought of as a document being authored by a
single research group, which has a number of particular topics which they may choose
to publish on and which may be represented in the current document. Each group is
associated with an entity random measure and a topic random measure, which results
in a group having a distribution over topics and entities, and this gives rise to a nested
structure. Note that, under this model, only one group can contribute to a given docu-
ment. A variant of this model is to allow multiple groups to contribute to a document
as in the case of large-scale collaborations.
In the hybrid NDP-HDP mixture model, clusters can be members of multiple groups
so that an author entity may be a member of multiple groups. For ease of understanding,
I will subsequently represent the random measure over groups for each document in
terms of its stick-breaking weights, 𝜌𝑘, which weight each of the group-level random
measures over entities and topics (𝐸𝑘, 𝑇𝑘).
All the author entities and topics in the document are generated conditional on this
group. Since there is no knowledge a priori of how many components are in the group,
then a DP mixture model is an appropriate model.
Intuitively, a research group has a number of authors who share interests. In the
grouped author-topic model, in contrast to the author-topic model, the authors them-
selves are not associated with topics directly. As an illustrative example in Figure 5.3,
the authors D. Blei and T. Griffiths are members of the same group and so it is likely
that they co-author papers together. Since the co-authors and topics are so different
between the two groups, then given more examples, it is reasonable to infer that the two
T. Griffiths are different people. In the grouped author-topic model, 𝐻𝑤 = Dirichlet(𝜂)
denotes a prior distribution for the topic parameters where 𝜂 is usually the parameter
for a symmetric Dirichlet distribution. A topic is parameterised by a distribution over
the vocabulary of the corpus. Since this is conjugate to the likelihood (a multinomial
distribution), during inference 𝜃𝑤 can be integrated out. For the author name variation

model, there are multiple possible models but I use a relatively simple generative pro-
cess for changing an author name given its true name as described in Section 5.4.2.
The generative process for a whole corpus is as follows, where 𝛾 and 𝛼 denote con-
centration parameters for the global and lower level DPs respectively, the superscripts
𝑤 and 𝑎 denote the parameters or distributions for the topics and the author entities
respectively. 𝐻𝑤 denotes the base measure for the topics and 𝐻𝑎 denotes the base
measure for the author entities. GEM represents the distribution from the stick-breaking
construction. 𝜌𝑘 denotes the weight from the stick-breaking construction for each group
𝑘 = 1, … , ∞. These weights determine the group randommeasure over entities 𝐸𝑘 and
topics 𝑇𝑘. Finally, 𝜃 denotes the parameters for the likelihood models for the authors
and topics and 𝑓(𝑎|𝜃𝑎) is the probability the name reference 𝑎 is a variant of the canon-
ical (true) name 𝜃𝑎 under the name variation model. For brevity, I do not write out the
conditioning of 𝑓(⋅) on the name variation model parameters (𝑝I, 𝑝R, 𝑝D).
1. Draw (from their prior distributions) the concentration parameters for the global
DPs, 𝛾𝑤, 𝛾𝑎, 𝜏 for the topics, authors and groups respectively. Likewise, draw the
concentration parameters for the lower-level DPs, 𝛼𝑤, 𝛼𝑎 from their priors.
2. Draw a global distribution over topics 𝑇0 ∼ DP(𝛾𝑤, 𝐻𝑤) and author entities 𝐸0 ∼
DP(𝛾𝑎, 𝐻𝑎). Draw a distribution over groups 𝝆 ∼ GEM(𝜏).

3. For each group 𝑘, draw a distribution over topics 𝑇𝑘 ∼ DP(𝛼𝑤, 𝑇0) and author
entities 𝐸𝑘 ∼ DP(𝛼𝑎, 𝐸0).
4. Now for each document 𝑖,
a) Draw a group to generate the document 𝑔𝑖 ∼ 𝝆.
b) For each word 𝑤𝑖𝑗 ,
i. Draw a topic 𝜃𝑤𝑖𝑗 |𝑔𝑖 ∼ 𝑇𝑔𝑖 .
ii. Draw a word 𝑤|𝜃𝑤𝑖𝑗 ∼ Multinomial(𝜃𝑤𝑖𝑗 ).
c) For each author name 𝑎𝑖𝑗 ,
i. Draw an author entity 𝜃𝑎𝑖𝑗|𝑔𝑖 ∼ 𝐸𝑔𝑖 .
ii. Draw a (possibly modified) author’s name from the name variation
model 𝑎|𝜃𝑎𝑖𝑗 ∼ 𝑓(𝜃𝑎𝑖𝑗).
I also explore a similar model where each data point in the document is separately asso-
ciated with a group drawn from a document-level random measure over groups. In this
model, words and authors in a document can be allocated to different research groups
and are not restricted to one group. To investigate if there are significant differences to
assigning multiple research groups to a document, I also perform experiments on this
model, my hierarchical extension of the hybrid HDP-NDP. In this model, a document
no longer needs to be associated with one research group. A hierarchical structure is
used for groups and every document is composed of a mixture of groups.
5.5
Since calculating the exact posterior under DPmodels is intractable as described in Sec-
tion 3.8.6, I use approximate algorithms. Due to having a non-conjugate base measure
and the ease of implementing and verifying a MCMC approach, I use collapsed Gibbs
sampling based on the Pólya urn scheme for inference in this model.
Inference can be done using a Chinese restaurant process representation similar to
that described by Teh, Jordan et al. (2006) and involves Gibbs sampling while integ-
rating over conjugate distributions and the random measures 𝐸𝑘, 𝑇𝑘, 𝐺. 𝐸0 and 𝑇0 are
instantiated and sampled from. I avoid integrating over the global randommeasures, 𝐸0
and 𝑇0, since as shown in Chapter 4, doing this can slow down mixing of the Markov
chain as it would couple the sampling of multiple groups together.
For inference, the group allocations can be sampled given the word and author alloc-
ations, and then the word and author allocations can be sampled given the group. As
5.5 95
noted earlier, I integrate out the parameters for each topic, which are the multinomial
distributions over the words.
The true names in the corpus are represented in latent variables in the grouped author-
topic model. However, for practical purposes, to avoid the search over all possible ca-
nonical names, I make the computationally simplifying assumption that the true name
can be sufficiently well represented by one of the references in the corpus. Every unique
author name that appears in the corpus is, therefore, given an equal probability, 𝜂𝑎 of
being the canonical name for an entity so that 𝐻𝑎 = Multinomial(𝜂𝑎). This is equivalent
to using an empirical prior for the space of canonical names. However, in reality it is
unlikely for every unique name in the corpus to be equally likely to be a canonical name
since it is known that longer names are more likely to be full canonical names. It is also
probable that many canonical names do not exist in the corpus and ideally these should
be represented in 𝐻𝑎. This is because 𝐻𝑎 represents the probability of any author entity
having a particular canonical name. Therefore, if 𝐻𝑎 only put non-zero probability on
names observed in the corpus, then that assumes many entities in the corpus will share
the same name.
As a result, to fit the full name variant model, 𝜂𝑎 is learnt on a small training corpus
and a non-zero probability is put on names that are unobserved in the corpus. To ease
computation, these unobserved names will never be assigned as the canonical name of
an author in the corpus. In effect, this serves to reduce the number of final entities in the
model that share identical names and is necessary due to the use of this name variant
model and discrete base measure. In addition, since the base measure for the author
names is not conjugate to the name variation model, I use the non-conjugate auxiliary
variable sampling algorithm as described in Section 3.8.6 for the entity allocations.
This allows the name parameters for all names that are assigned to a single entity to be
resampled in a single step.
𝑤𝑖𝑗 denotes the 𝑗th word in the 𝑖th document and 𝑎𝑖𝑗 similarly denotes the 𝑗th au-
thor reference. Latent indicator variables are used to make inference easier. 𝑔𝑖 denotes
the group assigned to the 𝑖th document. 𝑧𝑖𝑗 denotes the author entity from which 𝑎𝑖𝑗 is
drawn and 𝑡𝑖𝑗 denotes the topic from which 𝑤𝑖𝑗 is drawn. So that 𝑧𝑖𝑗 = 𝑧𝑖 𝑗 = 𝑘 when
𝜃𝑖𝑗 = 𝜃𝑖 𝑗 = 𝜙𝑘. 𝛾 and 𝛼 denote the concentration parameters as described in the pre-
vious section. 𝝓 denotes the parameters for the distribution over words conditional on
each topic or over author references conditional on each author name. The conditional
distributions used for Gibbs sampling are given below.
The full process for sampling from the conditional posterior is enumerated below. 𝑛𝑔𝑠
is a count for the number of documents allocated to group index 𝑠. 𝑛𝑎𝑖𝑘𝑠 is a count for the
number of authors in the 𝑖th document being allocated to entity index 𝑘 and the group

index 𝑠. 𝑛𝑤𝑖𝑡𝑠 is a count for the number of words in the 𝑖th document being allocated
to topic index 𝑡 and group index 𝑠. Finally, 𝑛𝑣𝑡𝑤 is a count for the number of 𝑤 words
allocated to topic index 𝑡. In addition, ⋅ indicates marginalising over an index so that

where 𝑊 is the size of the corpus vocabulary, 𝑁𝑇 is the current number of instantiated
topics and 𝑁𝐺 is the current number of instantiated groups. A superscript −𝑖𝑗 indicates
that particular observation should be ignored. 𝛽𝑘 is the stick-breaking weight for the
respective component in the higher-level random measure and 𝛽new is the weight for a
new component. 𝜙𝑎𝑘 is the parameter for author entity 𝑘.
1. For each document 𝑖,
a) Sample the group allocation 𝑔 conditional on the topics and names in the
document. This indicates the group from which the document is generated.
After removing the current allocation 𝑔𝑖 from the counts 𝑛, the conditional
distribution is

where 𝑢 indexes into the topics and 𝑘 indexes into the entities. The values for 𝑢
where the topic is not associated with words in the current document and values
for 𝑘 where the entity is not associated with references in the current document
can be ignored to improve performance. The probability of sampling a group is
proportional to the number of times that group has been chosen for an author or
topic in the corpus.
5.5 97
b) For each author 𝑎𝑖𝑗 , sample the entity allocation 𝑧 for each author name.
After removing the current allocation 𝑧𝑖𝑗 from the counts 𝑛, the conditional
distribution is
𝑝(𝑧𝑖𝑗 = 𝑘|𝐳−𝑖𝑗 , 𝐠)
∝
⎧⎪

(𝑛𝑎⋅𝑘𝑔𝑖 + 𝛼
𝑎𝛽𝑎𝑘)𝑓(𝑎𝑖𝑗|𝜙𝑎𝑘), if 𝑘 = 𝑧𝑖 𝑗 for some (𝑖 𝑗 ) ≠ (𝑖, 𝑗)
𝛼𝑎𝛽𝑎new𝑓(𝑎𝑖𝑗|𝜙𝑎new), otherwise
(5.39)
The entity is chosen proportional to the number of times that entity is associ-
ated with the group that this author is currently assigned to. A new canonical
name 𝜙𝑎new is sampled from 𝐻𝑎, however, when the existing allocation 𝑧𝑖𝑗
is not shared with any other data points (i.e. 𝑧𝑖𝑗 is a singleton), 𝜙𝑎new is set
to be equal to 𝜙𝑎𝑧𝑖𝑗 .
When a new entity 𝑘new is sampled, then also draw 𝑏 ∼ Beta(1, 𝛾𝑎), set the
new weight 𝛽𝑎𝑘new = 𝑏𝛽𝑎new and set the new 𝛽𝑎new to (1 − 𝑏)𝛽𝑎new. 𝑏 corresponds
to the weight of the new atom that is instantiated from the Dirichlet process.
c) For each word 𝑤𝑖𝑗 , sample the topic allocation. After removing the current
allocation 𝑡𝑖𝑗 from the counts 𝑛, the conditional distribution is
𝑝(𝑡𝑖𝑗 = 𝑘|𝐭−𝑖𝑗 , 𝐠)
∝
⎧⎪

, if 𝑘 = 𝑡𝑖 𝑗 for some (𝑖 𝑗 ) ≠ (𝑖, 𝑗)
𝛼𝑤𝛽𝑤new 1𝑊 , otherwise
(5.40)
Similarly, the topic is chosen proportional to the number of times that topic
is associated with the group that this word is currently assigned to. If a new
topic is sampled in this step then draw the new weight for the topic as for
the authors.
d) Sample the document-level cluster counts via the Chinese restaurant pro-
cess where 𝑚𝑖𝑘 represents the number of ‘tables’ in document 𝑖 allocated
to cluster 𝑘, and accounts for the possibility that different allocations at the
document-group level can be assigned to the same entity at corpus level.
This represents the extra level of clustering induced by the HDP mixture
model at the document level. Sample 𝑚𝑎 conditional on the entity and group.
Sample 𝑚𝑤 similarly conditional on the topic and group.
5.6 98
Each 𝑚 count can be sampled by generating 𝑛𝑖⋅𝑘 uniformly distributed ran-
dom variables 𝑢1, … , 𝑢𝑛𝑖⋅𝑘 in [0, 1], so that:
𝑚𝑖𝑘 =
𝑛𝑖⋅𝑘
𝑚=1
𝟏 𝑢𝑚 ≥
𝛼𝛽𝑘
𝛼𝛽𝑘 + 𝑚
. (5.41)
where 𝟏 is the indicator function.
2. Sample the canonical string for each author entity:
𝑝(𝜙𝑘 = 𝑆|z) ∝
𝑧𝑖 𝑗 =𝑘
𝑝(𝑎𝑖 𝑗 |𝑆) (5.42)
where 𝑝(𝑎𝑖 𝑗 |𝑆) is calculated according to the name variation model. For altern-
ative models, any likelihood can be used here.
3. Sample 𝜷𝑎 from (𝛽𝑎1 , … , 𝛽𝑎𝐾 , 𝛽𝑎new) ∼ Dirichlet(𝑚𝑎⋅1, … , 𝑚𝑎⋅𝐾 , 𝛾𝑎) where 𝐾 is the
current number of instantiated author entities. Sample 𝜷𝑤 equivalently.
The concentration parameters are updated by sampling from their posteriors after
every round of Gibbs sampling following themethods in Section 3.8.4 and Section 3.8.7
adapted to sample different parameters for the entities, topics and groups following their
respective numbers of tables.
In identity resolution problems, the mode of the posterior can be more interesting
than the full posterior distribution that is sampled by the Gibbs algorithm. The sim-
ulated annealing schedule of Haghighi and Klein (2007) can be used, which samples
entities proportional to the entity posteriors exponentiated according to the current cycle
number. At the end of the preset number of cycles, a mode is found. In my case, I am
calculating the expected author identity for each author reference and the full posterior
distribution will be more useful as it can describe the confidence in the number of en-
tities, groups and topics.

The best parameters for the name variation model were found with a parameter sweep
on a 10% subset of the CiteSeer dataset. The model was then evaluated on both a small
set of generated toy data and on real-world datasets.
The diagnostic methods by Gelman and Rubin as described in Section 3.4.1 were
used to assess whether the Markov chains have converged.

5.6.1 Toy data
I initially tested the model on a synthetic corpus by checking the model posteriors. The
synthetic corpus was created using the generative procedure described in the previous
section and consisted of 50 documents, generated from 8 authors, 3 research groups, 9
topics and a vocabulary of 100 words. Two of the authors have exactly the same names.
Each author name had between 0 and 2 name variants. Each document consisted of 60
words and 2 authors drawn from one research group. A Gamma(1, 0.1) prior was placed
on 𝛼𝑎 while the other concentration parameters were given Gamma(1, 1) priors, 𝜂 set
to 0.1. The Gibbs sampler was used to infer the parameters used to generate the corpus.
The concentration parameters were updated by sampling from their posteriors during
inference.
Table 5.2 shows the posteriors for the inferred number of authors, groups and top-
ics. Figure 5.5 shows the posterior density of various inferred quantities for this toy
problem. The final inferred number of names and research groups is close to those used
during data generation; however, the number of topics is slightly overestimated. This
indicates that inferring the true number of topics is difficult due to the high dimension-
ality of the problem, especially as each topic has its own distribution over 100 words to
be estimated.
The plot of the scale reduction factor over a number of iterations in Figure 5.6 show
that the number of names converges by around 2,000 iterations. The scale reduction
factors for the other posterior quantities also indicate that the chain has mixed within
2,000 iterations, as best as these diagnostics can assess.
5.6.2 Cita on dataset
To experiment with real-world data, I tested the grouped author-topic model on the
author lists and abstracts from several publicly available citation datasets. Since their
ground truth is publicly available, I chose the the real-world CiteSeer and Rexa data-
bases. The CiteSeer dataset was created by Giles, Bollacker and Lawrence (1998) and

ments where the abstract could not be found, the dataset contained 1,680 references to
706 authors across 852 documents. There were a total of 42,507 words in the abstracts
for the documents. The Rexa dataset (Peng and McCallum, 2006) contains documents
from the Rexa citation database and is partially labelled by Culotta. Experiments are
run on the entire dataset with both labelled and unlabelled authors but only evaluated
using the labelled authors. The Rexa dataset contains 9,366 author references in total
with 1,972 of those labelled to 105 author identities and 20,600 words across 2,697
abstracts. Since only 20% of the references are labelled, I expect that the results will
be biased towards models that cluster many names together since each labelled author
will generally have many occurrences. On the other hand, the CiteSeer dataset contains
many more singleton author entities, authors that only appear once in the corpus. For
all datasets, I applied a standard stoplist and stemmed the words. For the Rexa dataset,
words which appeared less than 9 times were also removed. This resulted in a vocabu-
lary size of 790 for Rexa and 5,695 for CiteSeer.
I compare mymodel, the grouped author-topic model, with other similar approaches:
The grouped author-topic model where a document is
allocated to one group. This is the model shown in Figure 5.4b.
The grouped author-topic model where a hier-
archical model is used for the groups, so that a document is associated with a
mixture of latent groups. Words and authors can be allocated to different groups
within a document. This is the model shown in Figure 5.4a.
A model where words are allocated to author entities directly rather than
to groups. This is similar to the model in Chapter 4 with a non-conjugate base
measure and better name variant model. Figure 4.1 shows the model closest to
this one.
- A reimplementation of the LDA-ER model (Bhattacharya and Getoor, 2006),
which uses the concept of groups to perform disambiguation but does not use
any of the abstract or free-text and requires the number of groups to be fixed in
advance. This is one of the best performing unsupervised generative models used
for entity resolution.
This method assigns identical names to the same entity.
5.6 103
I sampled the entity, topic and group allocations in rounds. 𝜂 was set to 0.1 (similar
to the HDP-LDAmodel) as this was found to be the best setting after training on 10% of
the CiteSeer dataset. 𝜂𝑎 and the parameters for the name variant model were also trained
on the training dataset where the best value of 𝜂𝑎 was found by testing values at different
orders of magnitude. For the entities, I used an uninformative Gamma(1, 0.005) prior
for 𝛾 and 𝜏 and aGamma(1, 1) prior for 𝛼 and updated by sampling from their posteriors.
These priors and similar priors for concentration parameters were chosen via minim-
ising KL-distance to give a uniform prior distribution for the number of clusters, as in
Section 3.8.4. Changing the priors by an order of magnitude did not significantly influ-
ence the results. However, using a standard Gamma(1, 1) prior for 𝛾 produced poorer
results with lower deduplication performance as measured by F1 by a few percent as
overclustering occurs. This is because the standard prior for 𝛾 puts a very high prior
probability on a very small number of clusters which is an unreasonable assumption
for the number of author identities. I set the hyperparameters for the LDA-ER model
to be those that are used for the other models to ensure a uniform prior distribution for
the number of clusters.
I used the B3 algorithm to calculate precision, recall and F1 as defined in Section 4.7.1,
which is the standard algorithm used in coreference system evaluations. I also calcu-
late the pairwise duplicate recall, precision and F1 scores and these are displayed in
Table 5.3. However, pairwise scores underweight the performance of a model on entit-
ies that have few occurrences.
From the Gelman and Rubin potential scale reduction factor (PSRF) plots in Fig-
ure 5.7, it can be seen that the chains have appeared to converged after 100,000 it-
erations. The model is implemented using C++ and it takes around 4.5 hours to run
100,000 iterations running on a single core of a 3.00GHz Intel Xeon CPU for the Cite-
Seer dataset.
My results show that the grouped author-topic model performs better than other un-
supervised approaches including LDA-ER. The grouped author-topic model with only
one group per document performs best on the CiteSeer dataset, whereas the variant
model where multiple groups are allocated to each document performs best on the Rexa
dataset. This shows that which of the grouped author-topic models is better may depend
on the characteristics of the corpus. In the case of the variant that allows for multiple
groups per document, this may imply that there are weaker research group and coau-
thor relationships in the Rexa dataset. Another difference between the two variants of
the grouped author-topic model is that the model with multiple groups per document
learns fewer topics. This is most likely because each word and corresponding topic in
a document is more likely to be allocated to a group that already has instances of that

topic allocated to it. As a result, it is less likely for a topic to be allocated to a group
that does not have any similar topics and so it is less likely for new topics to be instanti-
ated. The increased flexibility of allowingmultiple groups to be allocated to a document
also means that there are more groups in general. These differences most likely contrib-
uted to the differing results for the two datasets so that the best variant of the grouped
author-topic model for a dataset depends on how flexible the model needs to be.
The LDA-ERmodel assumes that identical author references always refer to the same
author identity. Applying this assumption to mymodel requires that identical references
are assigned to the same entity. This effectively putting an upper limit on the number
of entities equal to the number of unique names in the dataset. Inference then involves
assigning an entity to each set of identical references simultaneously. However, this
would result in a model that would be unable to handle ambiguous names, a significant
advantage of my model over LDA-ER.
LDA-ER does not perform as well in the CiteSeer dataset as seen in Table 5.3, and it
can be seen that the posterior has more entities than the other models. The results show
that with the domain-specific name variant model, naively adding abstract information
results in worse performance than not using abstracts at all. My model succeeds in
integrating abstract and co-author information as seen in the results as compared with
results for the models which do not (LDA-ER and the no groups model). The model
without groups exhibits poorer performance than the model with groups, most likely
because the posterior of the DP overweights author entities with many assigned words
so that the name of the author has less effect. This can be seen by the lower precision in
the model without groups than the models with groups. The model without groups also
has significantly fewer topics and entities than the other models. The small number of
topics again indicate that some author entities are overweighted due to the number of
words allocated to them, making it unlikely that new entities are instantiated.
The grouped author-topic model also has better precision than the other models. This
is because the co-author information aids in separating out similar entities more than
the topics do. This can be valuable in certain applications where precision is more
important than recall when it would be a major error if the system confused two similar
but different entities. The F1 score in the results equally weights the recall and precision
scores.
The results for these models also improve on the results from Section 4.8. Much of
the improvement likely comes from using a better name variation model that is domain-
specific whereas in Chapter 4 a name likelihood model was used that had a conjugate
prior so allowing the name variation parameters to be integrated out. This allowed for
simple inference while allowing the name model to be quite general. These models also

significantly improve on the simple baseline of using an exact string match to assign
identical names to the same author identity. This is a reasonable approach to take when
the number of author identities are unknown andwhen there is no name variationmodel.
The inferred topics in Table 5.5 seem reasonable and fit the theme of the corpus,
which focused on computer vision, logic and reinforcement learning. An example of
an inferred research group is given in Table 5.4. This appears to be a reasonable group
consisting of people who collaborate on some of the papers in the corpus on various
clustering and kernel methods.
5.6.3 Conflated CiteSeer dataset
The CiteSeer and Rexa datasets have very little ambiguity. As seen in the results, per-
forming an exact string match on the author name results in 100% precision, which
means that two references of the same author name will always refer to the same entity.
Thus to better show the capabilities of my model in disambiguating entities, I created
another dataset where some of the authors from the CiteSeer dataset are conflated to-
gether. This is also the same conflated dataset used in Chapter 4. This is done by taking
the CiteSeer dataset and discarding the last names from the authors. The process results
in a dataset with 362 unique names or roughly 2 author entities for every unique author
name. 𝜂𝑎 was retrained on 10% of this conflated dataset and all the other hyperparamet-
ers were set to the same as those in the full CiteSeer dataset.
The results on this dataset are shown in Table 5.6. They show that the grouped author-
topic model where only one group is allowed per document performs significantly bet-
ter at disambiguating entities than the other models. In addition, with this dataset the
abstract information gives better precision than the model that does not use abstracts.
However, the model where multiple groups are allowed per document performs worse
than the other approaches. Looking more closely, there are many more groups in the
posteriors for this dataset than in the original CiteSeer dataset. A likely reason for this is
that, in this dataset, author names are more similar and provide less information about
author identity. As a result, having multiple groups per document leads to more groups

being used to explain the variation in the document abstracts. On the other hand, in the
original CiteSeer dataset, the groups were used to explain the variation in author refer-
ences and co-authors. This can be seen in the posterior where there are twice as many
groups as entities in the conflated dataset, whereas there are twice as many entities as
groups in the original dataset.
The results for these models compared to Section 4.8 have a much smaller advantage
from the name variation model since names are a smaller distinguishing factor in this
conflated dataset. This can be seen since only the model with one group per document
surpasses the best performing model in Section 4.8. This shows that modeling research
groups and having a model of one group per document is good for modeling corpuses
with high name ambiguity. The one group per document model also significantly im-
proves on the simple baseline of using an exact string match to assign identical names
to the same author identity, whereas the other models do not improve on this baseline.
5.6.4 John Smith ambiguity dataset
This dataset is one that LDA-ER cannot tackle due to its inability to disambiguate au-
thors with identical names. I ran experiments on the ‘John Smith’ corpus to determine
if the model can disambiguate authors based solely on document text without a name
variation model. The task is to disambiguate the name references using text in the docu-
ment. The corpus and hand-labelled ground-truth was provided by Bagga and Baldwin
(1998b). The corpus is an ambiguous set of 197 articles extracted from the 1996 and
1997 editions of the NewYork Times. The criteria for including an article was the pres-
ence of a string that matched the ‘/John.*?Smith/’ regular expression. This ensures that
the matched articles have name references for people with the first name John and last
name Smith but does not capture name variants. The dataset consists of 35 different
John Smiths, 24 of these were only mentioned in one article whereas the remaining 11
were mentioned in the other 173 articles. The background and profession of each of the
John Smiths varies greatly from a CEO to the former head of the Labor party.
Following Gooi and Allan (2004), I extracted a 55-word window of text centered
around the ‘John Smith’ reference in each document and used these in the experiments.
I removed the authorial part of the model so that each group is used to represent an
author entity and so an author entity is now a distribution over topics. I perform experi-
ments with uninformative priors on the concentration parameters and evaluate using the
posterior group allocations. The results are evaluated using the B3 score and compared
with a vector space model in Table 5.7. The agglomerative vector space model (Bagga
and Baldwin, 1998b) requires setting a similarity threshold above which two clusters

the vector space model. However, even though my unsupervised model is run fairly
with no tuning of the parameters, my model performs well compared with the best per-
forming agglomerative vector space model. Putting a smaller prior on the concentration
parameters may reduce the overclustering that happened during inference causing dif-
ferent people to be assigned to the same entity. This could be done by training 𝜂𝑎 or the
concentration parameters on a training dataset.
5.6.5 WePS 2 people clustering dataset
Finally, I show results on another disambiguation task. I ran experiments on the dataset
from the WePS 2 (Artiles, Gonzalo and Sekine, 2009) people clustering task. The goal
of the task is to disambiguate person names in web search results. 30 randomly chosen
names were searched for on an Internet search engine. The top 150 search results were
retrieved, and each document was hand annotated to match with a real identity. The
dataset is highly ambiguous with an average of 18 different people per name.
I extracted the words from each webpage, removed stopwords and ran the result
through the Stanford named entity recogniser (Finkel, Grenager andC.Manning, 2005).
I used the extracted named entities in place of the author references in my model and
used the Jaro-Winkler distance metric as the name variation model. This flexible model
was chosen to allow different ways of writing names, locations and organizations to be
matched together. I used the non-entity words as the observed words for each document.
I then performed experiments with priors on the concentration parameters that were
scaled logarithmically in proportion to the given real-world frequency of that name.
Since annotations are labelled at the document level, I evaluate my model using the

posterior group assignments. The results in Table 5.8 show that my unsupervised model
almost matches the performance of the supervised bag of words approach. The super-
vised bag of words approach represents documents as a bag of words weighted with
TF-IDF. The similarity between documents is calculated by cosine distance, and pairs
of documents above a set similarity threshold are assumed to refer to the same entity.
The supervised approach has the advantage of learning a similarity threshold from the
training set, which is fully labelled with the true identities. On the other hand, mymodel
does not make use of any of the training set. Results where the best threshold is found
on the test set is also given and acts as an upper bound. Many of the approaches used by
other participants in the task are reliant on learning a cutoff threshold from the training
data or using a supervised approach using additional features based on person attributes
or web search queries. The topics and inferred groups that are inferred by my model
could also be used as additional features in a supervised algorithm.
5.7
My grouped author-topic model models the authorship of a document through a hier-
archical model that combines a topic model with a multiple authorship model. This al-
lows information that comes from a document having multiple authors and the content
in a document to be leveraged to usefully disambiguate the authors that are represented
in the corpus. In this chapter, I have evaluated my unsupervised model against both
toy and real world data and shown that it performs well in the task of identity resolu-
tion compared against other state of the art approaches. The model shows significant
improvement over ignoring groups or abstracts in the citation database examples and
shows that it can perform well at disambiguating entities with identical names in a set
of documents. The results show that the best-performing method for disambiguation is
one in which the entities and topics in a document are explained through a single latent
variable, a latent group that gives a distribution over both entities and topics. This al-
5.7 113
lows the posterior distribution over entities conditional on the group to be independent
of the length of text in each document. However, in cases where there is little or no
ambiguity in the dataset then the variant of the model that allows for multiple groups
in the document performs better.
Each latent group in the grouped author-topic model essentially merges the doc-
uments allocated to that group into one super-document. This can aid in analysing
short documents, such as tweets and text messages where messages have strict char-
acter length limits. Standard topic models are typically unable to learn coherent topics
from the few words available in such short documents. Document merging can be done
but then it can be difficult to decide which documents should be merged. The grouped
author-topicmodel allows good topics to be learnt from the automaticallymerged super-
document. The super-document would be represented by the latent group, which could
be a collection of some of the related topical tweets by a group of related users or by one
user. This can also lead to detecting which messages have been split into a set of smaller
messages due to the message length limits. Finally, the model can also be reduced to a
typical HDP model by forcing each document to its own latent group.
My model is versatile in that it can disambiguate identical name references that refer
to different entities, as well as combine differing references to the same entity. The
model is fully automated in that it does not require pre-specification of numbers of
entities, research groups, topics, etc. This is a result of the model taking a Bayesian
nonparametric approach to the problem and allowing broad uninformative priors for
the number of entities, etc. while more informative priors for the number of entities can
be chosen if needed.
To accomplish inference, a Gibbs sampler is used to sample from the posterior. Al-
though the base measure for the entities is non-conjugate, using an auxiliary variable
Gibbs sampler still resulted in good performance. With the aid of various convergence
diagnostics, the sampler is also shown to converge quickly and mix well. The name
variation model is based on a domain-specific string metric, which allows the probab-
ilities of characters to be changed, inserted or deleted in a name to be specified a priori
or learnt from a training dataset.
There is room to explore other possibly faster sampling options such as a variational
inference procedure (Teh, Kurihara and Welling, 2008) although the non-conjugate
base measure complicates this. The name variation model could be changed to a 𝑛-
gram model or a discriminative name model to simplify inference or to use the model
in other areas. For example, the appropriate likelihood and base measure may allow the
modelling of co-entity relationships to be used for word sense disambiguation. The de-
pendent DP framework introduced in MacEachern (1999) could also be used to allow
5.7 114
for a set of dependent random measures that are marginally DPs, allowing the model to
be extended dynamically or use more complicated types of base measure. In the context
of my framework, this dependency can be viewed as an indicator variable indicating
whether an observation in a document is an author reference or a word and then using
the appropriate base measure. It would also be possible to model how research groups
change over time in terms of their member composition and the topics they write about.
This could be done by extending the model to integrate publication dates.

NONPARAMETR I C AND KEYWORD - SUPERV I S ED TOP I C
MODE L S
In this chapter, I develop two new supervised models that utilise topics, where topics
are distributions over the vocabulary and are described in Section 3.5. In addition, I
analyse their performance with experiments on regression and classification tasks. The
problems of regression and classification are fundamental in a variety of tasks and set-
tings from computer vision to natural language processing. These problems consist of
labelled examples where each example is a pair consisting of a predictor, also known
as input or independent variable, and a response, also known as output or dependent
variable. These examples are then used to predict the responses for unlabelled test data.
The new models are the nonparametric supervised HDP (sHDP) model and the para-
metric keyword-supervised topic model (ksLDA). The sHDP model is a nonparametric
extension of supervised latent Dirichlet allocation (sLDA) (David M. Blei and McAul-
iffe, 2007). The sHDP has an infinite number of topics, preventing the overfitting or
underfitting that can result from a fixed number of topics that is unsuitable for the data-
set. It is a supervised extension of the HDP mixture model described in Section 3.8.7.
The ksLDA model is an extension of sLDA where different words can have a more
direct effect on a document’s response and the effect of the words can be perturbed by
their context. In this chapter, I show that these new models perform better than sLDA.

Topic models, as described in Section 3.5, are an unsupervised model of the text in the
documents of a corpus. The latent topics that are learnt by the models are particularly
important when modelling large document collections as they can reduce the dimen-
sion of the data. These models define a topic as a distribution over words in the vocab-
ulary of the corpus. Each topic can be thought of as a group of semantically related
words, and these inferred topics shed light on the common themes that run through the
documents. The models have been successful in analysing collections of documents,
including citation databases and newsgroup corpora. They can also be used for a wide
range of applications including data exploration and information retrieval.

Recently, attention has turned to these models as ways of performing regression and
classification on collections of documents, where each document possesses an associ-
ated response. The response can be categorical, continuous, ordered or other types. For
example, the responses can be sentiment ratings or field categories. A simple approach
to this problem is to use topic models as a dimensionality reduction method and then
to regress on the lower dimension dataset. A set of topics is learnt for the corpus us-
ing a topic model (LDA) while ignoring the document responses. Then the document
responses are regressed on the empirical topic distribution for each document. But this
approach performs poorly in contrast to directly regressing on the empirical word dis-
tribution for each document. The topics that are learnt also often have no relation to
the responses that need to be predicted. As a result, words that cause positive responses
and words that cause negative responses end up being assigned to the same topic. This
has spurred interest in supervised topic models that can learn topics that are both good
models of document contents and are good predictors for document responses.
Supervised topicmodels such as supervised latent Dirichlet allocation (sLDA) (David
M. Blei and McAuliffe, 2007) are an extension of topic models. Topics that are learnt
are more useful than that obtained in unsupervised topic models such as LDA for pre-
dicting a document’s response. This is because the learnt topics are oriented around
words that relate to document responses. In contrast, unsupervised LDA learns topics
that are in line with the general theme of the documents, but are often unrelated to the
document responses. David M. Blei and McAuliffe (2007) found that the predictions
made by sLDA of the responses for an unseen test set were better than the predictions
made using the unsupervised topics inferred by LDA. However, they found that the
sLDA model only performed slightly better than LASSO regression (Tibshirani, 1994)
on the empirical distribution of words for each document.
Although these models perform well, they are limited as the number of topics in
the model must be fixed in advance. This can lead to overfitting if there are too many
topics or underfitting if there are too few topics where the learnt topics may poorly
represent the documents. A number of methods can be used to choose the number of
topics, including cross-validation and model comparison techniques; however, these
are often unsatisfactory and slow. Bayesian nonparametric methods, as described in
Section 3.7, have emerged as a good way to extend these models naturally to handle a
flexible number of topics.
In this chapter, I present the supervised HDP (sHDP) model as a generative super-
vised model that has an infinite number of topics (or clusters) used to predict a docu-
ment response and the keyword-supervised topic model (ksLDA) as an extension to the
sLDA model that allows different words to have a more direct effect on the document
6.2 117
responses and for the words’ context to perturb their effect. The rest of the chapter is
organised as follows. In Section 6.2, I briefly review some existing work on tackling
the supervised learning problem with nonparametric models and also approaches spe-
cifically for grouped data. Section 6.3 sets the problem and the form of the data for the
models proposed in this chapter. Section 6.4 gives an introduction to generalised linear
models, which are a class of models that generalise linear regression. I review the ex-
isting sLDA model in Section 6.5. I then introduce my two new models, the supervised
HDPmodel in Section 6.6 and the keyword-supervised topic model in Section 6.7. Sec-
tion 6.8 describes the Gibbs inference algorithms that are used to sample from the pos-
teriors of the newmodels. Finally, Section 6.9 covers experiments with these models on
real-world datasets consisting of both binary and continuous responses and compares
the new models to existing models.
6.2
Bayesian nonparametric models have more flexibility than that in parametric models.
Nonparametric models allow the number of utilised parameters in the model to grow as
more data is observed so that the structure of the model can adapt to the data. Dirichlet
process (DP) mixtures are a popular type of nonparametric model that can have an
infinite number of clusters. These models are commonly unsupervised and are used for
problems that require a model that can better adapt to the data.
Due to their flexibility, there has been interest in supervised nonparametric models,
such as the regression models of Gaussian processes (GPs) (Rasmussen and Williams,
2006) and Bayesian regression trees. Dirichlet processes have also been adapted for
supervised problems. An example of this is the DP multinomial logit model (dpMNL)
(Shahbaba and Radford M. Neal, 2009). In this generative model, each example is a
covariate with an associated response. The relationship between the covariates and re-
sponses are then modelled jointly using DP mixtures. Although within each cluster the
relationship is assumed to be linear, an overall nonlinear relationship occurs when the
model has more than one cluster. A multinomial logit is used to model the responses
conditionally on the covariates within each cluster. Thus, the regression parameters of
the logit model are different for each cluster. The predicted responses are conditional on
the parameters and the covariates. The dpMNL model was tested on protein fold clas-
sification, and compared with existing methods based on neural networks and support
vector machines. The results showed that the dpMNL model performed significantly
better.
6.2 118
The dpMNL has been extended to model additional response types with DPmixtures
of generalised linear models (DP-GLM) (Hannah, D. Blei and Powell, 2011). Whereas
the dpMNL only explicitly models discrete responses, the DP-GLM can generatively
model both continuous and discrete responses using different generalised linear models.
Again, the regression coefficients of the generalised linear models are different for each
cluster. Priors are also placed on the coefficients, resulting in a model for the response
that is similar to a regularised regression model. The model was shown to have weak
consistency by Hannah, D. Blei and Powell (2011), and the performance was shown to
be comparable to a Gaussian process model, which is a nonparametric model that is the
state of the art for regression.
Both kinds of approaches, however, have not yet been applied to grouped data such
as documents and the problem of predicting the responses of groups of observations.
Supervised latent Dirichlet allocation (sLDA) is one approach to tackling this prediction
problem for grouped data. sLDA learns topics that are able to model the document
responses more accurately. For example, in sentiment analysis tasks, the topics learnt
would consist of words that cause the document to have positive or negative sentiment.
Similarly, for financial news, the topics would consist of words that have positive or
negative effects in the market. The sLDA model has, however, limited flexibility since
the number of latent topics must be fixed in advance leaving it at risk of overfitting
or underfitting. The sHDP model I present in this chapter removes that limitation by
extending the HDP mixture model to supervised problems.
Hierarchical Dirichlet process (HDP) mixture models, described in Section 3.8.7,
are a type of Bayesian nonparametric model that can be used instead of LDA for topic
modelling. They are commonly used as the nonparametric analog to LDA, allowing for
flexible topic modelling without being restricted to a fixed number of topics. Though
inference is more complex, Gibbs sampling and variational Bayes techniques can still
be applied. Until now, HDP mixtures have not seen significant use in supervised prob-
lems and suffer the same problems as unsupervised LDA in that the topics learnt are
not necessarily predictive of the responses. The sHDP model I present in this chapter
extends the HDP mixture model to learn topics that are good predictors of document
responses.
Another problem with supervised topic models is that they model the effect of the
words on the document response only indirectly through topic allocations, and so they
are unable to model the magnitude of different words’ effect on the document response.
For example, stronger words such as funniest would be clustered into the same topic as
milder words such as fine and so end up having the same regression coefficient as other
words in the topic. I propose the ksLDA model that allows different words to have a
6.3 119
more direct effect on the response and for their effect to be influenced by the context of
the words. There has also been work on other methods of learning the regression coef-
ficients or other response types such as DMR (Mimno andMcCallum, 2008), DiscLDA
(Lacoste-Julien, Sha and Jordan, 2008), MedLDA (Zhu, Ahmed and Xing, 2009) and
labeled LDA (Ramage et al., 2009), however, these models still have a fixed number of
topics and do not directly model the effect of different words.
6.3
We assume that there is a set of data points divided into 𝐷 groups. To reduce com-
plexity, a bag of words model can be used for each group, amounting to assuming ex-
changeability among the observations within a group. Each group 𝑖 consists of both a
variable number of data points 𝑥𝑖𝑗 , 𝑗 = 1, … , 𝑁𝑖, which are the predictors, and a single
response 𝑦𝑖. In the case of document modelling, 𝐷 is the number of documents in the
corpus, each word uses one-of-𝑉 encoding 𝑥𝑖𝑗 ∈ {1, … , 𝑉} where 𝑉 is the size of the
vocabulary of the corpus. 𝑦𝑖 is the response for the document, such as a rating or a cat-
egory. In the rest of this chapter, the models will be described in terms of documents
and words, but the models can also be used on other kinds of grouped data. Given a set
of training examples with predictors and associated responses, the task is to predict the
responses on a separate test set.
6.4
Often when a response is not an unconstrained continuous variable, it is transformed
into one and a normal linear model is used for it. However, this may not always be
appropriate. A generalised linear model (GLM) expands the flexibility of linear mod-
els by being capable of analysing data where either there may not be a linear relation
between the covariates 𝑥 and the response 𝑦 or where a Gaussian assumption for 𝑦
is inappropriate. A generalised linear model is specified by a linear predictor which I
denote in this section by 𝜃, a link function 𝑔(⋅) that relates the linear predictor to the
mean of the response 𝜇 = 𝑔−1(𝜃) and a probability distribution from the exponential
family, described in Section 3.2, that gives the distribution of the response 𝑦 with mean
E(𝑦|⋅) = 𝜇. In this chapter, I only consider canonical link functions though others can
be used when needed. The canonical link function is the function of the mean parameter
that is in the exponent of the exponential family form of the probability density. The
6.5 120
distribution of the response may also be an exponential dispersion family that has an
additional dispersion parameter denoted as 𝛾 .
A generalised linear model that models a response 𝑦 is
𝑝(𝑦|𝜃, 𝛾) = ℎ(𝑦, 𝛾) exp 𝜃𝑦 − 𝐴(𝜃)𝛾 , (6.1)
where the distribution of the response is modelled by an exponential dispersion family
with natural parameter 𝜃. ℎ(𝑦, 𝛾) is the base measure, 𝑦 the sufficient statistic and 𝐴(𝜃)
the log-normaliser. The canonical parameter is 𝜃.
Different forms of responses can be modelled using different choices of ℎ and 𝐴. In
particular, there is a normal distribution on 𝑦,
𝑝(𝑦|𝜃, 𝛾) = 1
√2𝜋𝛾
exp − 12𝛾 (𝑦 − 𝜃)
2 (6.2)
when ℎ(𝑦, 𝛾) = 1/√2𝜋𝛾 e−𝑦2/2 and 𝐴(𝜃) = 𝜃2/2. This is a normal linear model with
a mean of 𝜃 and variance of 𝛾 .
When 𝑦 is binary, a binomial distribution can be used with the number of trials 𝑛 = 1,
so that 𝑦 is distributed as
𝑝(𝑦|𝜃) = 𝜃𝑦(1 − 𝜃)1−𝑦 (6.3)
which uses the canonical logit link function 𝑔(𝜃) = ln(𝜃/(1−𝜃)) and the binomial distri-
bution for 𝑦. This choice of distribution and link function results in a logistic regression
model.
6.5
Supervised latent Dirichlet allocation (sLDA) (David M. Blei and McAuliffe, 2007)
is an extension of LDA (described in Section 3.5) to supervised problems. It partially
overcomes the problem that the topics that are learnt cannot be controlled in the LDA
model. The learnt topics in LDA act to reduce the dimension of the data but may not
be predictive of a document’s response as they will correspond to the general themes
of the corpus rather than be predictive of document responses. sLDA overcomes this
problem by jointly learning topics and their regression coefficients for the document
responses. The response for a document is predicted by averaging over the empirical
topic allocations for a document.
6.5 121
The following generative process for each document 𝑖 is followed. Let 𝐾 be the fixed
number of topics, 𝑁𝑖 the number of words in document 𝑖, 𝝓1∶𝐾 the topics where each
𝝓 is a distribution over the vocabulary, 𝛼 a parameter for topic proportions, and 𝜂 and
𝛿 the response parameters.
1. Draw topic proportions 𝜃𝑖 ∼ Dirichlet(𝛼).
2. For each word,
a) Draw a topic assignment 𝑧𝑖𝑗 ∼ Multinomial(𝜃𝑖).
b) Draw a word 𝑤𝑖𝑗|𝑧𝑖𝑗 ∼ Multinomial(𝜙𝑧𝑖𝑗 ).
3. Draw the document response 𝑦|𝑧𝑖,1∶𝑁𝑖 , 𝜂, 𝜎
2 ∼ GLM(⋅| ̄𝑧𝑖, 𝜂, 𝛿)where ̄𝑧𝑖 = 1/𝑁𝑖 ∑
𝑁𝑖
𝑗=1 𝑧𝑖𝑗 .
The linear predictor in the GLM model for the response is 𝜂⊤ ̄𝑧 where ̄𝑧 are the em-
pirical frequencies of the topics in the document and 𝜂 are the regression coefficients.
Since the GLM model conditions on the unobserved empirical topic assignments, the
document’s response is non-exchangeable with the topic assignments. As a result, the
document’s contents are assumed to be generated first and then the document’s response
is chosen conditional on those contents. This is a reasonable assumption tomake asmost
labels for documents are chosen post-hoc after the document has been written, such as
a document’s category. An alternative to this model is one where 𝑦 is regressed on the
topic proportions for the document 𝜃, which is the limit of ̄𝑧 being averaged over an
infinite number of iterations. However, this may result in some topics being estimated
that just explain the response variables while other topics only explain the document
words.
In the sLDA model, the parameters 𝛼, 𝜙1∶𝐾 , 𝜂 and 𝛿 are treated as constants to be
estimated. Approximate maximum-likelihood estimation is then performed with a vari-
ational expectation-maximisation (EM) method, similar to that for LDA.
The models I propose in this chapter solve two of the problems in this model. One
problem with sLDA is that the number of topics must be fixed from the start. This
can result in overfitting or underfitting if the number of topics is unsuitable for the
dataset. Though the number of topics can be chosen based on a training set, it may
be time consuming and the number is dependent on the size of the dataset. Another
problem with sLDA is that the words in a document only have an effect on the model
of a document’s response through the words’ topic allocations. The model effectively
averages the effect on a document response across words in the same topic, thus the fact
that some words have a stronger effect and others have a weaker effect on a document’s
response gets lost.

The supervised HDP (sHDP) model proposed in this chapter can automatically learn
the necessary number of topics to model the responses of documents on training data.
It is a Bayesian nonparametric model so that a potentially infinite number of latent
clusters can be used for prediction. The sHDP model extends the HDP mixture model
to learn clusters that align with document responses. The relationship between the data
points and the responses is modelled with a generalised linear model on the clusters
to which the data points in a document have been allocated. A regression coefficient is
associated with each cluster, and the document’s response is regressed on the average
of these coefficients.
In the sHDP model, unlike sLDA, the number of topics does not need to be fixed in
advance. This is beneficial in supervised problems since it is unclear how many latent
topics will be necessary to model the data and the response conditional on the docu-
ment. The response is modelled by a generalised linear model (GLM) conditioned on
the topics that have been assigned to the observations in the document. Since the number
of instantiated topics can vary and each topic has a regression coefficient, the number
of instantiated regression coefficients also varies given the current number of instanti-
ated topics. In the generative process, a regression coefficient is sampled for each topic
in addition to sampling a distribution over the vocabulary. In effect, a product base
measure is used for the topics where one component is a prior over the vocabulary and
the other is a prior for the regression coefficient. This treats the regression coefficients
as random variables, whereas in sLDA, the regression coefficients are treated as con-
stants. This modelling of the regression coefficients effectively results in a regularised
regression model for the response variables. Each topic can also be assigned a vector
of regression coefficients, which can be used when there are categorical responses.
The model is thus
𝐺0 ∼ DP(𝛾𝐻) (6.4)
𝐺𝑖 ∼ DP(𝛼𝐺0) (6.5)
𝜃 = (𝜃𝑋𝑖𝑗 , 𝜃𝑌𝑖𝑗 ) ∼𝐺𝑖 (6.6)
𝑥𝑖𝑗|𝜃𝑋𝑖𝑗 ∼𝑓(𝜃𝑋𝑖𝑗 ) (6.7)
𝑦𝑖|𝜃𝑌𝑖⋅ ∼ GLM(⋅|𝜃𝑌𝑖⋅ ) (6.8)
where 𝜃𝑌𝑖⋅ = (1/𝑁𝑖) ∑𝑗 𝜃𝑌𝑖𝑗 is the linear predictor for the GLM, 𝑖 ranges over each doc-
ument, 𝑗 ranges over each observation in that document, 𝛾 denotes the concentration
parameter for the corpus-level DP and 𝛼 denotes the concentration parameter for the
6.6 ( ) 123
document-level DP. The base measure 𝐻 = 𝐻𝑌 × 𝐻𝑋 consists of a measure for the re-
gression parameters 𝜃𝑌 ∼ 𝐻𝑌 and another measure for the topic parameters 𝜃𝑋 ∼ 𝐻𝑋 .
𝐺0 is the corpus-level random measure that acts as the base measure for the document-
level random measure 𝐺𝑖.
Due to the clustering property of the DP, some data points will share the same para-
meters 𝜃, which can be represented as those data points being assigned to the same topic.
The prior density for the regression parameters, 𝜃𝑌 ∈ ℝ, is typically 𝐻𝑌 = N(0, 𝜁)
where 𝜁 is the variance of the parameters. For topic modelling, the documents consist
of words, and the prior density for the cluster parameters is 𝐻𝑋 = Dirichlet(𝛼𝑤), where
𝛼𝑤 is the parameter for a symmetric Dirichlet distribution and so 𝜽𝑋 ∈ ℝ𝑊 where 𝑊 is
the size of the vocabulary. I found that changing these priors by an order of magnitude
did not significantly change the results. 𝑓 is the likelihood of 𝜃𝑋 given the observations
𝑥. In a topic modelling problem, 𝑓(𝜃𝑋) = Multinomial(⋅|𝜃𝑋). When coupled with its
conjugate prior, the Dirichlet distribution, the topic parameters 𝜃𝑋 can be integrated
out, allowing for collapsed Gibbs inference to be performed by just keeping track of
the word to topic allocations and the regression coefficients for the topics. The GLM
model for the responses allows the responses to be continuous, ordinal, categorical and
other types depending on the form of the GLM. When the base measure for the coeffi-
cients 𝐻𝑌 is a Gaussian distribution, the maximum a posteriori (MAP) solution for the
coefficients is similar to the solution for 𝐿2 penalised logistic regression with a logistic
GLM and for ridge regression with a Gaussian GLM. A graphical model is shown in
Figure 6.1.
The generative process for the full model is:
1. Draw (from their prior distributions) the concentration parameters for the global
DPs 𝛾 . Likewise, draw the concentration parameters for the lower-level DPs 𝛼
from their priors.
2. Draw a global distribution over topics and their regression coefficients 𝐺0 ∼
DP(𝛾, 𝐻).
3. Now for each document 𝑖,
a) Draw a distribution over topics 𝐺𝑖 ∼ DP(𝛼, 𝐺0).
b) For each word 𝑤𝑖𝑗 ,
i. Draw a topic (𝜽𝑋𝑖𝑗 , 𝜃𝑌𝑖𝑗 ) ∼ 𝐺𝑖.
ii. Draw a word 𝑤 ∼ Multinomial(𝜽𝑋𝑖𝑗 ).
c) Draw a response for the document 𝑦 ∼ GLM(𝜃𝑌𝑖⋅ ) where 𝜃𝑌𝑖⋅ = (1/𝑁𝑖) ∑𝑗 𝜃𝑌𝑖𝑗 .
6.6 ( ) 124
Figure 6.1: The supervised HDP model.
The sHDP learns topics that both model document contents well and are predictive
of document responses without the need to choose a fixed number of topics beforehand.
This structured approach to supervision allows the model to be easily extended to incor-
porate additional information from documents to aid in predicting the response such as
the authors of a document or the research group which authored a document, which can
be inferred through the model described in Chapter 5. For example, the problem of pre-
dicting the venue where a paper is published by learning the venues where the research
group has previously published. Another example could be the problem of predicting a
set of keywords or categories for a paper by learning which categories have previously
been picked by the research group for those topics. Allowing for the topics to be super-
vised could also allow users of the model to control the types of topics that are learnt by
the sHDP in case the unsupervised topics learnt are not along the lines of what the user
would like to explore. Finally, the sHDP model allows for unlabelled data to be used as
part of the training set in semi-supervised problems. This allows supervised topics to
be learnt that take into account the content of unlabelled documents so that the learnt
topics can better model the entire corpus instead of just the labelled documents.
6.7 - ( ) 125

A problem with the supervised topic model is that it smooths over the effect of different
words in a document on the document’s response. A document’s response has an indir-
ect relationship with the words via the topic allocations in the document. As a result,
it is possible for both strongly positive and weakly positive words to be allocated to
the same topic resulting in them having the same regression coefficient in the model of
the response. An alternative approach is to allow different words to have a more direct
effect on a document’s response using the keyword-supervised LDA (ksLDA) model
proposed in this section.
The ksLDA model extends the sLDA model so that the response for each document
is modelled both by the empirical distribution over topics in each document and by the
actual words in each document. The response is modelled with a GLM that is condi-
tioned on both the topics that have been assigned to the words in the document and the
words in the document themselves. Experiments with a non-parametric variant of this
model where the number of topics was not fixed showed results similar to the paramet-
ric model (as discussed in Section 6.9) so I present the parametric variant here for ease
of understanding and implementation.
The following generative process for the full model is followed. Let 𝑧𝑖𝑗 denote the
topic indicator for word 𝑗 in document 𝑖, 𝜙𝑘 denote the parameters for topic 𝑘 and
𝜼 = (𝜼𝑡, 𝜼𝑤) denote the regression parameters for the GLM.
1. Draw (from their prior distributions) the concentration parameter 𝛼 for the topics.
2. Draw (from their prior distributions) the regression coefficients 𝜼𝑡 for each topic
and the regression coefficients 𝜼𝑤 for each word.
3. Now for each document 𝑖,
a) Draw a distribution over topics 𝜃𝑖 ∼ Dirichlet(𝛼).
b) For each word 𝑤𝑖𝑗 ,
i. Draw a topic 𝑧𝑖𝑗 ∼ Multinomial(𝜃𝑖).
ii. Draw a word 𝑤𝑖𝑗|𝑧𝑖𝑗 ∼ Multinomial(𝑤𝑖𝑗|𝜙𝑧𝑖𝑗 ).
c) Draw a response for the document 𝑦 ∼ GLM(𝐳𝑖, 𝐰𝑖⋅, 𝜼𝑡, 𝜼𝑤) where 𝐰𝑖⋅ =
(1/𝑁𝑖) ∑𝑗 𝑤𝑖𝑗 and 𝐳𝑖 = (1/𝑁𝑖) ∑𝑗 𝑧𝑖𝑗 .
The prior density for the regression parameters is typically 𝜼𝑡 ∼ N(𝟎, 𝜁 𝑡𝐈) and 𝜼𝑤 ∼
N(𝟎, 𝜁𝑤𝐈). In a topic modelling problem, the likelihood 𝑓 , of the topic parameters is
the multinomial distribution so the prior for the topic parameters can be chosen to be
6.8 126
Figure 6.2: The keyword-supervised LDA model.
the conjugate prior 𝜙𝑡 ∼ Dirichlet. This allows the topic parameters 𝜃 to be integrated
out, allowing for inference to be done using cluster indicators. The GLM model allows
the responses to be continuous, ordinal, categorical and other types depending on the
form selected. The linear predictor for the GLM uses the word distribution of the doc-
ument and is (𝜼𝑡, 𝜼𝑤)⊤(𝐳𝑖, 𝐰𝑖⋅). During learning, 𝜼𝑤 is estimated once at the start of the
process and is then kept fixed. This is because re-estimating it during sampling can
cause the effects of the words to be reassigned to the topics since the topics are collec-
tions of words. This decreases the regression parameters of the words and lowers the
impact of strong words. 𝜼𝑡 is re-estimated during sampling since the topics consantly
change. When the prior for the coefficients is chosen to be a Gaussian distribution, the
maximum a posteriori (MAP) solution is similar to the solution from a 𝐿2 penalised
logistic regression with a logistic GLM and from a ridge regression with a Gaussian
GLM.
A graphical model is shown in Figure 6.2.

Since posterior inference is intractable in both DP-based models and LDA, approxim-
ations must be used. Collapsed Gibbs sampling is the most common technique used to
sample from the posteriors of these models, and it can also be applied to the models
described in this chapter. For topic modelling problems and word-based datasets, the
Dirichlet base measure for each topic is conjugate to the multinomial likelihood for
the words. This enables the topic parameters, which are distributions over the vocab-
ulary, to be integrated out. Thus at each iteration and based on the Chinese restaurant
6.8 127
process, collapsed Gibbs sampling can be used to sample the topic allocations. I estim-
ate the maximum a posteriori (MAP) regression coefficients instead of sampling from
their posteriors to reduce computation time. The following sections describe inference
in both the proposed sHDP and ksLDA models. A latent indicator variable 𝑧 indicates
to which topic a word is allocated.
6.8.1 The sHDP model
Since the base measure for the topic regression coefficients will not in general be con-
jugate to the GLM response model, the non-conjugate auxiliary variable sampling al-
gorithm (alg. 8) described by Radford M. Neal (2000) is used to sample the topic alloc-
ations. The main difference from inference for the HDP mixture model is in sampling
the topic allocation variable and estimating the topic regression coefficients. The con-
ditional distribution for the topic allocation has an additional term for the conditional
likelihood of the topic parameters given the document response. Gibbs sampling pro-
ceeds as below.
1. For each document 𝑖,
a) For each word 𝑤𝑖𝑗 , sample 𝑧𝑖𝑗 for the topic allocation, where 𝑛𝑖𝑘 is the num-
ber of words in document 𝑖 allocated to topic 𝑘 and a superscript −𝑖𝑗 for a
variable denotes the variable while ignoring the current allocation 𝑧𝑖𝑗 ,
𝑝(𝑧𝑖𝑗 = 𝑘|𝐳−𝑖𝑗 , 𝑤𝑖𝑗 , 𝜷)

the other words allocated to topic 𝑘 and 𝑓new is the probability of the word in an
empty topic.
If a new topic 𝑘new is sampled during one of the steps above, then draw 𝑏 ∼
Beta(1, 𝛾), set the new weight 𝛽𝑘new = 𝑏𝛽new and set the new 𝛽new to (1 − 𝑏)𝛽new. 𝑏
corresponds to the weight of the new atom that is instantiated from the Dirichlet
process. Also, set 𝜼 to the value of 𝜼new.

b) Sample 𝑚𝑖𝑘, where 𝑘 ranges over the topics, by generating 𝑛𝑖𝑘 uniformly

For a continuous response assuming 𝛾 = 1,
𝑝(𝑦𝑑|𝐳, 𝜼) ∝ exp(−(𝑦𝑑 − 𝜼⊤ ̄𝐳)2) (6.11)
and for a binomial response where 𝑦𝑑 ∈ {0, 1},
𝑝(𝑦𝑑|𝐳, 𝜼) = (𝜼⊤ ̄𝐳)𝑦𝑑 (1 − 𝜼⊤ ̄𝐳)1−𝑦𝑑 . (6.12)
During prediction, the posterior of ̄𝐳 is needed over the test documents. This is cal-
culated by removing the terms that depend on the response 𝑦 from the conditional dis-
tributions so that inference on the test documents is identical to unsupervised sHDP.

and sampling the allocations and counts for the test documents.
6.8.2 The ksLDA model
For the keyword-supervised LDA (ksLDA) model, the coefficients for the words 𝜼𝑤
are first estimated while the topic coefficients 𝜼𝑡 are set to 0 and 𝜼𝑤 is then fixed. Dur-
ing sampling, 𝜼𝑡 is estimated after several rounds of sampling the topics. This allows
the coefficients 𝜼𝑤 to be learnt for the effect of the different words on the documents
response and then for the topic coefficients 𝜼𝑡 to be learnt to perturb the effects of the
words according to the context of the document. The initial word coefficients can be
learnt through a 𝐿2 or LASSO regression of the document’s response on the empir-
ical word distribution. The topics can be learnt with either collapsed Gibbs sampling
6.8 129
or variational mean field inference. For a Gaussian model for the document’s response
this turns out to be equivalent to learning a regression model and then modeling the
residuals using the topics. However, this may not be the case for other document re-
sponses.
Gibbs sampling proceeds as in unsupervised LDA with an additional term for the
document’s response.
1. For each observation 𝑗 in document 𝑖, sample 𝑧𝑖𝑗 for the topic allocation, where
𝑇 is the number of topics, 𝑉 is the size of the vocabulary, 𝑛𝑖𝑘 is the number of
words in document 𝑖 allocated to topic 𝑘, 𝑛𝑤𝑤𝑘 is the number of times word 𝑤 has
been allocated to topic 𝑘, 𝛼𝑤 is the concentration parameter for the prior Dirichlet
distribution for the topic parameters and a superscript −𝑖𝑗 denotes the variable
while ignoring the current allocation 𝑧𝑖𝑗 ,

For a continuous response assuming 𝛾 = 1,
𝑝(𝑦𝑑|𝐳, 𝜼) ∝ exp(−(𝑦𝑑 − 𝜼𝑡⊤ ̄𝐳 − 𝜼𝑤⊤𝐰𝑑)2) (6.15)
and for a binomial response where 𝑦𝑑 ∈ {0, 1},
𝑝(𝑦𝑑|𝐳, 𝜼) = (𝜼𝑡⊤ ̄𝑧 + 𝜼𝑤⊤𝐰𝑑)𝑦𝑑 (1 − 𝜼𝑡⊤ ̄𝐳 − 𝜼𝑤⊤𝐰𝑑)1−𝑦𝑑 . (6.16)
During prediction, as for the sHDP, the posterior of ̄𝑧 is needed over the test docu-
ments. The inference process for these test documents is identical to unsupervised LDA.
The posterior for the test documents can be sampled by replacing (6.14) with
𝑝(𝑧𝑖𝑗 = 𝑘|𝛼, 𝜼, 𝑤, 𝐳−𝑖𝑗) ∝

(6.17)
and sampling the allocations and counts for the test documents.
6.8.3 Parameter es ma on and predic on
The topic regression coefficients are estimated after each round of sampling the topic
assignments. I also performed experiments where the topic assignments were sampled
for several rounds in between estimating the regression coefficients. But this made little
6.8 130
difference to prediction performance. The topic coefficients can be updated in the same
way for both ksLDA and sHDP by regressing only on the topics that are allocated to
at least one observation in the sHDP. I will describe cases for a Gaussian and binary
response in this section, though other models for the response can be used too.
Gaussian model
To improve computation speed, instead of fully sampling from the posterior of the
regression parameters, I optimise the parameters and find the maximum a posteriori
(MAP) values. This can be found by rewriting the model response as
𝐲 = 𝐗𝜼 + 𝐜 (6.18)
where 𝐲 is a length-𝐷 vector of document responses, 𝐗 is a 𝐷 × ∞ matrix of cluster to
document allocation counts, 𝜼 is a vector of regression parameters for each topic and 𝐜
are the residuals. Let 𝐗 be the matrix where row 𝑑 is the empirical topic distribution for
document 𝑑. Since only a finite number of topics have non-zero counts in the corpus, the
columns in 𝐗 that have zero counts and their corresponding 𝜼 entries can be ignored,
so making the optimisation tractable. For ksLDA, 𝐗 is a 𝐷 × 𝐾 matrix where 𝐾 =
𝑇+𝑉 . I found in preliminary experiments that in calculating 𝐗 for ksLDA, averaging the
empirical topic distribution for each document across 𝑀 samples produces much better
predictions of the document response than using the empirical distribution derived from
a single sample.
The MAP solution for the parameters 𝜼 while minimising 𝐜 can be calculated numer-
ically by
𝜼 = 𝐗⊤𝐗 + 𝜁𝐈 −1 𝐗⊤𝐲 (6.19)
where 𝜁 is the prior variance for the concentration parameters and I denotes the identity
matrix. When 𝜁 = 0, this reduces to standard least squares. From preliminary experi-
ments, I found that increasing 𝑀 improves the estimation of the coefficients.
For prediction, topics are sampled for test documents as in (6.13) for sHDP and (6.17)
for ksLDA. The empirical topic distribution is sampled over a number of iterations with
any topics that are instantiated or any topics that are removed during this period ignored.
The remaining empirical topic distributions for each document are averaged and used
to calculate the expectation of the response.
For the sHDP model, this is calculated as
E[𝐲|𝐳, 𝜼] ≈ 𝜼⊤ E[ ̄𝐳]. (6.20)
6.8 131
For the ksLDA model, the empirical word distributions are also used for prediction:
E[𝐲|𝐳, 𝐰, 𝜼] ≈ 𝜼⊤(E[ ̄𝐳], 𝐰). (6.21)
Binomial model
For the logistic regression GLMmodel, we seek to find the parameters 𝜼 which maxim-
ises the objective (likelihood function). The likelihood in the case of the sHDP model
is
𝑙(𝜼) ∝ −
𝐷
𝑑=1
log(1 + exp(−𝑦𝑑𝜼⊤ ̄𝐳𝑑)) −
𝜁
2𝜼
⊤𝜼. (6.22)
The gradient is
∇𝜼𝑙(𝜼) =
𝑑
(1 − 𝜎(𝑦𝑑𝜼⊤ ̄𝐳𝑑))𝑦𝑑 ̄𝐳𝑑 − 𝜁𝜼 (6.23)
where 𝜎(⋅) is the sigmoid function,
𝜎(𝑥) = 11 + exp(𝑥) . (6.24)
A similar objective with the addition of the words and coefficients in the linear pre-
dictor is used for estimating the ksLDA parameters. Since the objective function is
not analytically tractable, the limited-memory BFGS algorithm can be used to find the
MAP estimate of the parameters (Minka, 2003). This is a quasi-Newton optimisation
method that approximates the inverse Hessian matrix by analysing gradient vectors.
For prediction, topics are sampled for test documents as in (6.13) for sHDP and (6.17)
for ksLDA as for the binomial model.
For the sHDP model, the distribution of the response is given by
𝑝(𝑦𝑑 = 1|𝐳, 𝜼) ≈
exp(𝜼⊤ E[ ̄𝐳])
1 + exp(𝜼⊤ E[ ̄𝐳]) (6.25)
and similarly for the ksLDA model, it is given by
𝑝(𝑦𝑑 = 1|𝐳, 𝐰, 𝜼) ≈
exp(𝜼⊤(E[ ̄𝐳], 𝐰))
1 + exp(𝜼⊤(E[ ̄𝐳], 𝐰))
. (6.26)

I conducted experiments on four real-world problems. Firstly, the problem of classify-
ing financial newswires based on their effect on the direction of change of the closing
prices of a set of stocks. Secondly, the problem of classifying movie review sentences
based on whether the review was classified as positive or negative. Thirdly, the re-
gression problem of predicting a rating for a full movie review and finally the regres-
sion problem of predicting the popularity of a document. Following David M. Blei and
McAuliffe (2007), the datasets were preprocessed to keep the words with the highest
total TF-IDF score. TF-IDF is a measure of how important a word is for a document
in a corpus. The score is calculated as tf (𝑤) × log 𝐷/𝑛𝑤 where tf is the frequency of
the word 𝑤 in the document, 𝐷 is the number of documents and 𝑛𝑤 is the number of
documents where the word 𝑤 occurs. This is summed across all the documents for each
word, and the highest scoring words are kept.
The newswire dataset consists of a set of real-world newswires extracted from Reu-
ters about the stocks in the S&P 500 on different days over a year up to May 2011. The
newswires were labelled with the companies that were mentioned in the wire. These
labels were used so that only newswires whose stocks on days that had more than an 8%
positive change or 3% negative change from the previous day were considered. These
cutoffs were chosen so that the numbers of declining stocks were similar to the number
of rising ones, and to ignore minor changes of prices due to other factors. This resulted
in a dataset of 1,518 documents and a vocabulary of 1,895 words. The review snippet
classification dataset (Pang and L. Lee, 2005) consists of reviews from the Rotten To-
matoes website with reviews that were marked as fresh labelled as positive reviews and
reviews that were marked as rotten labelled as negative reviews. The dataset contains
5,331 positive snippets with the same number of negative ones and a vocabulary of
4,310 words.
The review snippet regression dataset (Pang and L. Lee, 2005) consists of reviews
written by four film critics where the writer additionally assigned a rating to his or her
review. The ratings were normalised to be between 0 and 1. Following David M. Blei
and McAuliffe (2007), any words that appeared in more than 25% of the documents
were removed as were any words that appeared fewer than 5 times. Only the remaining
top 2,179 words by TF-IDF score were then kept. The ratings for each document were
preprocessed to normalise the scores by applying a logit transform. There was a total
of 5,005 documents with a vocabulary of 2,179 words. The document popularity re-
gression dataset is a dataset of submission descriptions from the Digg website with the
6.9 133
associated number of votes that each submission received. The number of votes were
again normalised by applying a logit transform.
Experiments were performed with the sHDP model, the keyword-supervised LDA
model and the sLDA model.
The accuracy for classification problems and predictive 𝑅2 for regression problems
after five-fold cross-validation were calculated. Predictive 𝑅2 is defined as
𝑝𝑅2 = 1 −
∑𝑑( ̂𝑦𝑑 − 𝑦𝑑)2
∑𝑑(𝑦𝑑 − ̄𝑦)2
, (6.27)
where 𝑦𝑑 are the observed responses, with 𝑑 ranging over the documents, ̂𝑦𝑑 is the
response predicted by the model and ̄𝑦 = 1/𝐷 ∑𝐷𝑑=1 𝑦𝑑 is the mean of the observed
responses. This value gives the proportion of variability in the data set that is accounted
for by the model and is often used to evaluate the goodness of fit of a model. A value
of 1.0 is obtained when the regression line perfectly fits the data.
In the experiments, the prior standard deviation of the parameters 𝜁 was tested with
several values on the training set and the best one chosen. For ksLDA, the best value
for 𝜁𝑤 was found on the training set using a penalised regression of the response on the
empirical word distributions. 𝛼 for the ksLDA model was set to 50/𝐾 , where 𝐾 is the
number of topics, similar to previous experiments with LDA. 𝛼𝑤 for the sHDP model
was set to 0.01 similar to previous experiments with HDP. In the sHDP, the stand-
ard prior Gamma(1, 1) was placed on 𝛼 and 𝛾 and these are sampled during inference.
For ksLDA, the regression coefficients were optimised after every round of sampling
the topic allocations for a total of 20,000 iterations. From looking at the residuals and
weights of the regression coefficients, the Markov chain appears to have converged
after this many iterations. For sHDP, learning took place over 2,000 iterations with the
coefficients being optimised every iteration. For predicting the responses of the test
documents in ksLDA and sHDP, 500 iterations of topic sampling were used to allow
the inferred topics to converge. The number of iterations was chosen by looking at the
trace plots of the residuals, which appeared to converge by that number of iterations.
To compare my models, I also carried out experiments using supervised LDA with
40 topics. This number of topics was found by splitting the training set in each cross-
validation fold into further smaller training and testing sets. Different numbers of topics
were tested on these smaller training and testing sets to avoid leaking information from
the test sets. The models with 40 topics most often produced the best predictions on
the training set. Since in the HDP and the sHDP, the posterior distribution over topics
for each document is different than in LDA and sLDA, regression performance may be
different between these models even if the posterior number of topics is the same.

6.9.1 Results
Table 6.1 shows that my supervised HDP (sHDP) model performs somewhat better
than the sLDA model on the classification tasks. It performs roughly similar to sLDA
on the regression tasks. The better performance of sHDP for classification is likely due
to the increased flexibility of the model and faster mixing during inference. The in-
creased flexibility comes from the model having an infinite number of topics to model
the documents and responses. The faster mixing is because the inference process allows
the model to instantiate clusters or remove unneeded clusters during sampling. Since
newly instantiated clusters are empty, it is easier for words to change topic and be al-
located to a new cluster. In contrast, in sLDA each topic almost always has a significant
number of words allocated to it, making it difficult for the distribution of a topic to
change. This has the effect of smoothing over word contributions for each topic. For
regression, this is less important for sHDP as smoothing over word contributions af-
fects performance less than the hard boundaries used in classification. Thus, the more
specific topics in the sHDP model helps to improve classification performance.
From the combination of relatively low accuracy scores and large standard devi-
ations, it can be seen that the newswire dataset is much harder than the movie review
dataset. The standard deviations for the newswire scores imply that the data is much
more noisy since newswires only indirectly influence stock movements. In addition,
only closing stock prices were available, which means that it is possible there were
changes in the stock price from the general movement of the industry or the market.
The performance increase with ksLDA compared with sHDP is less for the newswires
than with the movie reviews, implying that the words used in newswires are not very
indicative of stock movement direction as compared with the words in movie reviews
being indicative of the movie rating.
The keyword-supervised LDA (ksLDA) model performs much better than sLDA on
both the regression and classification tasks. This is because the topics learnt by sLDA
are too broad to pin down the contributions to document responses from individual
words. Examining the coefficients for individual words shows a wide range between
words that have the largest and smallest coefficients, whereas in sLDA, word contribu-
tions are smoothed out over the other words in the document that happen to be assigned
to the same topic.
The prediction results of sLDA and ksLDA with different amounts of training data
are shown in Table 6.2. Reducing the amount of training data significantly reduces the
performance of sLDA, whereas there is a much smaller effect on the performance of
ksLDA. In addition, ksLDA trained on a small subset of the training set can outperform

sLDA trained on the full training set. This shows that many fewer documents are needed
to learn the effect of words on document responses than are needed to learn a set of
topics and the effect of those topics on document responses. This is likely because
similar positive words and negative words are being used by the authors across the
corpus allowing the effect of the words to be learnt from a relatively small dataset.
On the other hand, a small dataset is insufficient to learn specific enough topics that are
predictive of the document response. A dataset such as the document popularity dataset
would probably have a greater effect on ksLDA as the size of the training set shrinks.
ksLDA improves faster than sLDA as the training set grows because a larger training
set means that the model will observe more of the vocabulary in the corpus that affect
document responses. As more of the relevant vocabulary is observed, the improvement
in performance diminishes. On the other hand, sLDA’s performance increases much
more slowly since topic models typically require a large number of documents to learn
good topics. This is a harder problem as every topic in themodel has its own distribution
over the vocabulary.
A comparison of the effect of different numbers of topics for the two parametric
models is shown in Table 6.3. In ksLDA, as different words in a document have a direct
effect on the document’s response, fewer topics are required to explain the remaining
variation in the response. This can be seen in the results since the number of topics
affects the performance of sLDA more significantly than ksLDA. Decreasing the num-
ber of topics in the model affects the performance of both models more than reducing
the amount of training data, showing that training set size is still much more important
for model performance than model complexity. sLDA is much more prone to underfit-
ting if there are insufficient topics to model the documents. The result of this is most

likely that the words which have the biggest effect on the document response are mixed
with words which have a small effect since there are not enough topics to separate them,
causing the word effects to be smoothed over. Increasing the number of topics increases
iteration time and increasing to more than 40 topics does not improve the results and
increasing past that gradually degrades the results.
Additionally, I carried out experiments with the method of inference used in the ori-
ginal sLDAmodel, variationalmean field inference, instead of collapsedGibbs sampling.
I found, however, that this produced slightly poorer results than Gibbs sampling.
6.9.2 Analysis of strong topics and words
For the sHDP model, the top positive and negative topics, in terms of their regression
coefficients and their most frequent words for the movie review problem, are shown
in Table 6.4. The topics do not generally correspond to themes such as film genre or
style. Instead of this, the topics contain names and other unrelated words such as the
function words instead and appear. This is because the flexibility of a nonparametric
model means that the top positive and negative topics consist of very few words and are
allocated to actors and directors that are consistently reviewed well or poorly. This flex-
6.9 137
ibility results in strong topics that are grouped along consistently performing actors or
directors but which are less coherent since they are associated with so few documents.
Topics that consist of more words, even if those are strong words, generally have smal-
ler regression coefficients since the effect of the different words is averaged over other
words in the same topic. Strong words are spread among the top positive and negative
topics, for example, positive topic 5 contains the positive word charming and negative
topic 2 contains many negative words such as unfortunately, worse and problem. Since
many of the topics have actor and director names such as Tom Hanks in positive topic
2 and the Coen brothers: Ethan and Joel in positive topic 4, it can be seen that spe-
cific actors and directors are associated with consistenly better or poorer movie review
scores.
The top positive and negative topics for the newswire problem and their most fre-
quent words are given in Table 6.5. These topics are more cohesive than those for the
movie review dataset. The top positive topic contains very strong positive words such
as higher, strong, rise and record, which all imply good stock performance. The top
negative topic also contains strongly negative words such as cut, fall, decline and drop,
which clearly indicate bad performance. Similarly to the top topics for the movie re-
view dataset, it can be seen that some industries consistently have better or poorer stock
performance. For example, negative topic 2 consists of companies such as prudential
and metlife along with words such as insurers and insurance that indicate this industry
is performing badly. Positive topic 2 with words such as defense, military and share-
holders indicates that companies involved with the military and defence are performing
well.
For the ksLDA model, the words with the largest regression coefficients 𝜂𝑤 for the
movie review regression dataset are given in Table 6.6. These coefficients were estim-
ated at the start of inference and then kept fixed. This categorisation of the words can
be seen to be much clearer and more accurate than the topics learnt in the parametric
models where word contribution is not directly modelled. For example, the strongest
negative words worst, awful, dull and unfortunately are words that can typically be ex-
pected in bad reviews and the strongest positive words perfect, hilarious, brilliant and
stunning are words that are typically expected in good reviews. The word cinemato-
grapher: unexpectedly appears as one of the strongest negative words but this is likely
due to an error in the dataset. For example, negative reviews may be parsed wrongly
and so include some metadata fields like cinematographer as part of the review text.
Some words that are typically associated with a particular genre may have higher coef-
ficients than expected when that genre has its own vocabulary for judging the merits of

a movie. An example is the word hilarious, which is the second strongest positive word
most likely because it only appears in reviews for comedies.
An interesting distinction between these words and those in the top positive and neg-
ative topics in Table 6.4 is that both strong negative words such as worse and unfor-
tunately and weaker negative words such as problem and flat are assigned to the same
topic and therefore have the same coefficient in the parametric models. This shows that
these models smooth over the effect of different words on the document response. Inter-
estingly, the strongest positive and some of the strongest negative words do not appear
in the top words for the top negative and positive topics, which again indicates that
those word effects are being smoothed. On the other hand, the words in the top topics
for sHDP seem to correspond to people with names such as cameron and miller with
only one topic focusing on words that intuitively should have a strong contribution to
a movie rating. This shows that the topics being learnt are divided into those that cor-
respond to the content of the corpus and those that are more focused on general words
that affect the rating of a movie.
The top topics and their most frequent words that are learnt from the ksLDA model
are shown in Table 6.7. These topics are muchmore focused aroundmovie genres rather
than words that indicate a movie rating, except for negative topic 1. One reason for this
is that the regression coefficients for these topics act as a perturbation on the effect
of the words in the topic on the document’s response. This means that a topic with a
high regression coefficient does not indicate that the topic will predict a high posit-
ive response. This is because the response will also be affected by the word regression
6.9 141
coefficients for the different words in that topic. The effect of these topic coefficients
can be thought of as perturbing the effect of the words on the response according to the
context of the words. The top positive topic shows that movies about families adjust the
rating positively compared to the individual words allocated to the topic. For example,
words in the topic such as children and father, which are relatively neutral when taken
across all contexts, have a much more positive effect on the review score in the context
of a movie about a family, which are associated with words such as lives, tragedy and
powerful. Negative topic 1 mostly consists of words that would be expected to indicate
a bad movie, however, even in this case, normally neutral words such as watch and say
have a much more negative effect on the review score in the context of other negative
words such as awful and worst. This change in the effect of a word depending on con-
text is not as obvious from the sHDP model where the most positive topic and negative
topics have no association with film genres and is more concentrated on specific actors,
which are more likely to perform consistently. On the other hand, the most negative
topic learnt in ksLDA has no genre association. The other topics learnt by ksLDA have
genre associations such as the drug culture in positive topic 2 and the horror genre in
negative topic 2, indicating that these genres have a more positive and more negative
effect on the review rating compared to the individual words in the topics. This shows
that ksLDA was successful in learning both the effect of different words on the doc-
ument responses and the context of words that push the rating in a direction such as
those for certain genres.
The words with the largest learnt regression coefficients from the Reuters dataset are
given in Table 6.8. It can immediately be seen from the coefficients that performance
was poor in the third-quarter of the financial year and good in the fourth quarter and
september. These words likely appear in the most negative and positive words as they
are often used when a company publishes their quarterly reports, one of the most sig-
nificant events that affect a company’s stock price. Other negative words such as fall,
lower and weak indicate a company is performing poorly whereas raised, strong and
jumped indicate a company is performing well. More general words such as bank and
news are also in the list of most positive and negative words indicating that stock price
movements are relatively noisy as expected. In addition, news releases usually affect
stock prices the most within an hour of when they are first released whereas only clos-
ing stock prices are available so often a newswire does not directly affect the movement
of the stock price or may be reporting past movement of the price and the price may
instead be affected by the general market or industry trends.
The topics that are learnt through ksLDA for the Reuters dataset shown in Table 6.9
are more general and less coherent than those in the movie rating dataset. The top posit-

ive topic consists of words that mention drugs and the drug industry such as treatment
and medical. It also has words such as people and health, which would normally be
treated as negative words outside a drug context, whereas in this case, their association
with this industry has a small positive change on the effect of the words. The top neg-
ative topic is focused on banks and loans with words such as assets, loan, losses and
bank. Interestingly, the company citigroup is also included in this topic, whereas across
all contexts, citigroup would have a positive effect on stock price. This indicates that
the mentioning of citigroup in association with other banks, assets and loans will likely
have a negative change on the effect of the word and shows how the effect of words
can change in different contexts. The topics learnt are very focused on industries and
markets such as the oil industry in positive topic 3, manufacturing industry in positive
topic 4 and credit cards in negative topic 5 instead of words which are particularly pos-
itive or negative. The global economy was in general recovery near the start of 2011
so this positive topic 5 caused a slight positive change in word effects. Similarly to the
movie rating dataset, this shows that ksLDA can learn markets, industries and contexts
that trend in a certain direction with respect to their constituent words. The word coef-
ficients are more indicative of the direction of a stock rather than the context as can be
seen by the low topic coefficients, this again is likely due to the noisy dataset.
In general, the topics learnt from ksLDA are more genre and content oriented than
that in sHDP and indicate a perturbation on the effect of a word on the response de-
pending on the word’s context. As a result, the topics and topic coefficients have a
slightly different interpretation to sHDP and sLDA as they are more dependent on the

constituent words of the topics. sHDP learns strong topics that are assigned to fewer
words and indicate trends and tendencies at a lower level, for example, on the level of
actors instead of genres. For ksLDA, changing the prior variance of the word and topic
coefficients can change the balance of the effects from words and their contexts. This
can be used if it is known that few of the words in a dataset can be directly related to
a document’s response, such as documents written to be subtle or with a wide vocabu-
lary. In this case, the prior variance of the word coefficients can be reduced and that of
the topic coefficients increased. On the other hand, if a set of documents is known to
consist mostly of indicative words, such as when categorising documents according to
their field, then the field-specific words in the document are likely to be more significant
to the document’s category than the mixture of topics in the document. In this case, the
prior variance of the word coefficients can be increased and that of the topics reduced.
This allows the model to be very flexible in combining the two sources of information.
In addition, existing sources of knowledge such as the dictionaries that are used in
sentiment analysis problems can be easily incorporated into the ksLDAmodel by using
them to set the word coefficients or to offset the coefficients based on the dictionary
entries. The sHDP model can be useful when more specific trends or tendencies are
sought and when there is a possibility of overfitting or underfitting due to the number
of topics. Finally, preliminary tests with a non-parametric version of ksLDA did not
have a significant difference in performance to ksLDA. This is likely because ksLDA
is less sensitive to the number of topics in the model than sLDA.

I have presented a supervised Bayesian nonparametric model that handles grouped data.
Each group of data has an associated response such as sentiment ratings or document
popularity. The supervised HDP (sHDP) model learns latent topics that are predictive
of document responses without having to choose a fixed number of topics, a deficiency
in previous models such as supervised LDA. In those models, overfitting or underfitting
can occur if the number of topics is unsuitable for the dataset. The strongest topics learnt
in the sHDP are relatively low-level and are associated with fewer topics allowing their
effect on the document response to be learnt easily. Regression and classification ex-
periments were performed on real-world datasets and showed that the model performs
better than supervised LDA on classification but similarly on regression. Inference in
the sHDP remains simple and is an adaptation of that used in the HDP. The flexibility
and ease of inference of the sHDP means it has potential uses in many applications. A
more Bayesian approach can be taken by sampling over the posterior of the parameters
6.10 146
using Hamiltonian MCMC. Other inference techniques to improve performance can be
explored such as variational inference (Asuncion et al., 2009). While the sHDP does
not explicitly handle categorical outcomes, extra regression parameters for each topic
can be added to do so.
I also presented a supervised Bayesian parametric model for grouped data that dir-
ectly models the effect of different words on the document response. The keyword-
supervised LDA model (ksLDA) learns latent topics and the effect of those topics
and individual words on document responses. This prevents the effects from individual
words being smoothed out among other words in the same topic as in supervised LDA.
As a result, the topics learnt by ksLDA match the content of the corpus well, and the
topics learnt perturb the effect of their constituent words on the document responses. In
contrast, in sHDP and sLDA, topics are learnt that both describe document themes and
consist of words that have a large effect on document responses. The ksLDA topic coef-
ficients also allow a word to have different effects on the document response depending
on the word’s context. The model can also be easily extended to incorporate additional
information such as authors, titles or other metadata. Inference can be performed us-
ing Gibbs sampling, an easier alternative to the original variational inference method
used for supervised LDA. The model is also more resilient to different numbers of top-
ics compared to sLDA so that a nonparametric extension of ksLDA does not produce
significantly different performance. Finally, the model performs better at classification
and regression tasks than the state of the art sLDA model.
The supervised models can also be applied to the unsupervised models in Chapters 4
and 5. For example, if additional document metadata is available such as the venue
where a paper is published or the institution of the first author then these can be used to
learn topics and research groups that are more distinguished along venue or institution
lines. It may also be possible to use the latent group structure to help with general doc-
ument metadata prediction by learning groups that are predictive of document labels.
For example, a set of films that are distributed by a particular company may each have
the same common mix of themes but expressed in diferent ways. In this case, the user
may wish to predict the box office performance of a film which will be affected both
by the mix of themes and the distributor of the film. Finally, if unique identifiers are
available such as the email addresses of some of the authors, this could futher improve
deduplication performance of the model by learning topics that are more predictive of
the authors.
While sentiment analysis models such as Pang and L. Lee (2005) have a similar goal
of predicting document labels, the models I propose in this chapter are more general
than typical sentiment analysis models and do not require any bootstrap dictionary or
6.10 147
labels for the words. My models can additionally deal with a wide range of document
response types through a generalised linear model and can easily incorporate additional
information into its generative process. The models in this chapter are not restricted to
document datasets as they can be used on other kinds of data. For example, topic models
have previously been used on extracted image patches or image features by treating
the patches or features as words selected from a dictionary of patches. Similarly, the
models in this chapter can be used to predict the keywords of an image or the theme of
an image by directly modelling the effect of individual patches and their contexts and
by not requiring the number of topics to be fixed in advance.

COMPAR I SON OF MODE L S
The unsupervised and supervised models described in the previous chapters all involve
the joint modelling of topics and document metadata. The metadata often consists of a
list of author names but could also consist of labels such as categories and ratings. In
this chapter, I will explore some of the differences between the models I proposed in
earlier chapters.
7.1
Each of the models I presented treats document metadata in different ways. In the
author-topic models, the document metadata are variable-length lists of names that
refer to latent entities. The proposed author-topic space model in Chapter 4 uses 𝑛-
gram name variation models that have conjugate priors. This enabled relatively simple
inference compared with the more complex domain-specific name variation model in
Chapter 5. This domain-specific name variation model has the advantage of being able
to infer canonical names for each entity. This is not possible when the name variation
parameters are integrated out, such as in the 𝑛-grammodels. The domain-specificmodel
additionally allows easier incorporation of knowledge of how common a name is a
priori. Information about the commonality of a name is important in determining the
ambiguity of a name. For example, John Smith is a much more ambiguous name than
Alan Turing. The grouped author-topic model additionally models the co-occurrence
of these names and topics and so performs better than models that do not model their
co-occurrence. In the proposed sHDP and ksLDA models in Chapter 6, the document
labels are modelled with generalised linear models, allowing for a range of label types.
Such labels are modelled by a function of the regression coefficients for each topic
and in the ksLDA model also by a function of the word coefficients. Parallels can be
drawn between the supervised models and the author-topic model for disambiguation
where names are modelled as a function of the name parameters for each entity. A
key difference is that in the supervised models, the labels are modelled as being non-
exchangeable with the words and are conditional on the empirical topic distribution for
each document. In the author-topic space model for disambiguation, the labels (names)
and words are assumed to be exchangeable. This difference means that some authors
148
7.2 149
are not associated with any words and some words are not associated with any authors.
On the other hand, in the supervised models, the topics all have an effect on the model
of the document label.
The topics that are learnt in each of the Bayesianmodels are also different. In Chapter 4,
each author entity had their own individual topic. We saw that this can cause problems
both when an author is a prolific writer and when an author writes rarely. In these cases,
the probability of each author being allocated to an author entity can be dominated by
the number of words that are allocated to that entity so that the name of the author has
little effect. In these situations, an author can also end up being allocated to many func-
tion words and so ends up being allocated tomanywords in the corpus. In Chapter 5, the
number of topics learnt can vary significantly depending on the structure of the model.
For example, the number of topics is usually fewer in the model where a document can
be allocated to multiple latent groups than in the model where a document can only be
allocated to a single group. This effect is the result of allowing words within the same
document to be allocated to different groups. This flexibility means that a given word
is preferentially allocated to latent groups that already have that word’s topic allocated
to them, and therefore new topics are rarely instantiated to explain that word. In both
the models in Chapters 4 and 5, the topics that were allocated to the latent groups are
relatively good indicators of the topics on which the group of authors write. Finally, the
model without any groups has the fewest topics as there are no latent groups to help sep-
arate the topics. In Chapter 6, the topics learnt in the sHDP model are oriented around
document labels. Since the topics are supervised in contrast to the previous models, the
contents of the topics are affected by document labels. In the sHDP model, the super-
vised topics consist of both words based around themes (such as comedy) that tend to
affect the document label and unrelated words (such as excellent) that also affect the
document label but may not be coherent with the rest of the topic. In contrast, the su-
pervised topics in the ksLDA model are based around themes that affect the document
label, since the effect of the different words is modelled separately. This produces more
coherent topics and allows the effect of different words on the document response to be
dependent on context.
7.2
Even though the Bayesian nonparametric models are based upon the hierarchical Diri-
chlet process mixture model, the grouped author-topic model I presented in Chapter 5
used the nested Dirichlet process to add a layer of nesting. This extra layer is power-
ful because it allows random measures to be clustered, where the random measures
7.3 150
are over topics or entities. Each latent group in the grouped author-topic model can be
viewed as a merge of the documents allocated to that group into one super-document.
This can be useful for short documents, such as tweets, which are a type of message
with strict character length limits. Topic models typically have difficulties in learning
coherent topics from the few words available in such short documents. On the other
hand, in the grouped author-topic model, good topics would in effect be learnt from
the super-document, which could be a collection of some of the tweets by one person.
The grouped author-topic model can represent a typical hierarchical Dirichlet process
model by assigning each document to its own latent group. More complex methods of
nesting can also be used when there is a priori knowledge of the relationships between
the documents.
7.3
Posterior inference in the models presented is performed using approximate methods
since it is infeasible to sum over all possible cluster assignments. In the case of the
nonparametric models, collapsed Gibbs sampling is used after marginalising out the
document-level random measures. I also investigated the effect of marginalising out
the global random measure in Chapter 4 and found that this allowed the chain to mix
faster than when the global random measure was sampled. However, there is a greater
computational cost as both table and cluster allocations must be sampled for each data
point. The other new models I proposed in Chapters 5 and 6 all sampled the global
random measure instead of marginalising it out, making inference easier and faster.
Variational mean-field inference for existing models such as sLDA and HDP could also
be adapted for the supervised models in Chapter 6. Variational inference could result
in faster inference; however, the method would introduce new problems such as local
minima, which need to be tackled with random restarts.
Most of the parameters in the models I proposed were given a Bayesian treatment.
Hyperparameters for the concentration parameters were chosen to have an a priori uni-
form distribution for the number of entities in the models. For the topic concentration
parameters, standard hyperparameters were used so that there is a high probability of
relatively few topics compared with the number of words in the corpus as in previous
work with HDP-LDA. Concentration parameters were updated by sampling from their
posterior distributions during inference. In Chapter 6, however, the generalised linear
model parameters were optimised and set to their maximum a posteriori (MAP) values
instead of being sampled. This was done to speed up model inference. I expect that this
will not significantly influence the results compared with a fully Bayesian treatment.
7.4 151
An empirical Bayes approach was taken in Chapter 5 to set the prior probability that a
name in the corpus is a canonical name for a real person.
7.4
The models I proposed were all evaluated on real-world datasets. But due to the lack of
publicly available disambiguation datasets, the models in Chapters 4 and 5 were also
evaluated on artificial datasets made by conflating the names of a real-world citation
database. The evaluation results showed that the proposed models perform better than
some of the existing leading unsupervised approaches for name disambiguation. The
proposed supervised models in Chapter 6 were also evaluated on real-world publicly
available classification and regression datasets, though one of the classification datasets
(the newswires dataset) was manually built from real-world data. The prediction scores
from the evaluation showed that these proposed supervised models perform better than
one of the leading supervised topic models.
7.5
Even though all the experiments performed with the proposed models involved docu-
ments and their free-text, it would be possible to apply these models to other types of
data and problems. For example, for images, the analog of words in a document would
be the image feature vectors in an image. The proposed models could then be used to
analyse image metadata in the same way as document metadata, such as for predicting
image labels or resolving ambiguous names or labels of objects in the image to real
entities. The models can also be applied to documents where the metadata is not read-
ily available but instead inferred from the text. This is often the case for named entity
resolution, word sense disambiguation and coreference resolution problems.
A summary of the differences between the proposed models and some existing mod-
els is given in Table 7.1.

CONC LUS IONS AND FUTURE WORK
With the quickly growing number of documents and document collections now avail-
able, there is an increasing need to be able to analyse them automatically. Probabilistic
topic models are one approach which have had successes in many fields and applica-
tions, even for non-textual data. However, documents rarely consist of just free text and
often come with additional metadata such as author information and labels. Instead of
analysing this metadata separately from the text, it is becoming increasingly import-
ant to analyse the metadata and the text together so that inferences about one can help
the other. This can uncover useful insights into the document collection. The problem
of analysing and integrating multiple sources of information is further related to the
field of multi-modal integration (Al-Hames and Rigoll, 2005). In this field, a Bayesian
approach has a number of advantages, including being able to integrate different in-
formation easily where the prior accuracy or confidence for each source needs to be
accounted for when making inferences.
In this thesis, I proposed several novel Bayesianmodels for name disambiguation and
supervised learning. These models all utilise document metadata to both improve the
topics that are inferred and predict document labels and authors. Three of the proposed
models used Bayesian nonparametric techniques, allowing the model’s complexity to
adapt to the data and have an infinite capacity for authors or topics. The fourth model
used words in addition to topics to model a document’s label, allowing words to have
different effects on the model of the label according to their context. The models were
all evaluated on real-world collections, showing that the combination of models for text
and metadata gives good results and has fruitful opportunities.
In Chapter 4, I developed the author-topic space model for disambiguation. This is
a new Bayesian nonparametric model that integrates a name variant model and a topic
model to perform the difficult task of resolving names into authors in the presence of
name ambiguity and name variation. I explored a character-based bigram topic model
and a bag-of-words trigram based model to model name variation and found that the bi-
gram model performed better. I also compared the CRF with the direct Gibbs sampling
inference methods and found that CRF performed slightly better at the cost of greater
computational time. The author-topic space model can utilise the free text of a docu-
ment in contrast to other existing disambiguation models.
153
154
There is much opportunity for further work with this proposed model. For example,
the author list is modelled as an exchangeable list, which is rarely the case in most
documents. To weaken that assumption, an additional Dirichlet process could be used
to model the first author of documents differently from the rest of the authors. Ideas
from the dynamic topic model could also be used to analyse how the position of an
author in their author lists changes over time, for example, new professors gradually
move to the end of author lists as they become more senior. The model could also be
extended to different kinds of data, for example, replacing words in an image with bag-
of-words image features and replacing authors with common keywords or categories.
This allows the model to resolve the keywords with the aid of the image features, for
example, the model can resolve the sense of the word bank based on the presence of a
river bank or a high-street bank in the image.
In Chapter 5, I developed the grouped author-topic model, an extension of the work
in Chapter 4. I also described the hybrid NDP-HDP, an extension of the NDP, and pro-
posed the hierarchical extension to the hybrid NDP-HDP. These were used to develop
the grouped author-topic model. This allows the model to have latent groups, each of
which models the co-occurrence of latent author entities and topics. The model allows
topics and author entities to be members of multiple latent groups, which the original
NDP does not allow. The latent group structure can be thought of as research groups
where a research group consists of a number of authors working on a set of topics and
where these authors and topics may also be involved with other research groups. This
prevents authors who write many documents in the corpus from being overweighted in
the posterior. The model also uses a non-conjugate and domain-specific name variation
model so that names are better modelled than in the 𝑛-gram models. Using this name
variation model allows inferring which of the names in the corpus is the canonical name
for an author entity. The grouped author-topic model was shown to perform better than
models that do not take into account the co-occurrence of entities and was shown to
perform well at name disambiguation.
For future work, other name variation models can also be explored as well as more
principled ways of learning these variation models from training data. Canonicalisation
can be improved by merging different names from the corpus into a canonical name or
using methods to detect canonical names. This would be necessary, for instance, when
the author’s full name does not appear all at once in a document but is instead some-
times initialled in the corpus. In this case, the canonical name needs to be inferred from
the supplied names. The proposed model can also be extended dynamically using de-
pendent Dirichlet processes, to model the movement of author entities and topics in
the latent research groups. For example, authors can move between different research
155
groups or institutions, or become a less prominent contributor in one research group.
Authors interests can also change which may also be a result of moving to a different re-
search group or a result of the research group changing its topic focus. Finally, research
groups can be come more or less prominent over time and may also experience splits or
merges with other research groups. The model can be applied to other applications such
as named entity recognition or more general types of coreference resolution. In these
settings, the names and references need to be extracted directly from the document text
rather than already being available. It can be useful to explore the modelling of the co-
occurrence of names, references and topics in latent groups and use them to improve
results on those problems. It can also be useful to model types of data such as image and
annotation data where there is a need to model the co-occurrence of image features or
annotations. Finally, the research groups can be modelled using the Indian buffet pro-
cess (IBP) (Tom L. Griffiths and Ghahramani, 2006). The Indian buffet process allows
for models where objects such as latent research groups are represented with infinitely
many binary features. In the context of the author and research groupmodels, this would
prevent the number of authors or topics in a latent group from overly influencing the
probability of the group. This is because the research group would be represented by
the presence or absence of the authors or topics rather than the number of times the
author or topic has been allocated to that research group. This can be a better model
for real research groups where high-quality publications that are important to a field or
topic are more important than the number of publications.
In Chapter 6, I proposed two novel generative models for supervised learning with
topic models. The supervised HDP (sHDP) model uses supervised topics to predict
document labels without worrying about underfitting or overfitting due to a fixed num-
ber of topics. The keyword-supervised LDA (ksLDA) model better predicts document
labels by directly modelling the effect of words on document labels. The ksLDAmodel
performs better than the sHDP and sLDAmodel in classification and regression, though
both sHDP and ksLDA perform better than sLDA at classification. The direct model-
ling of words in ksLDA also reduces the importance of the number of topics. The sHDP
model performs better than sLDA at classification problems as these problems may be
more sensitive to the number of topics. The ksLDA model learns topics that show how
the context of different words changes the effect they have on document labels by mod-
elling the effect of different words directly.
There are many opportunities for new applications and future work in these new
models. For example, it would be interesting to see how different labels can influence
the kinds of topics that are learnt in a document collection. This can be useful when
the users of a topic model wish to learn topics around specific themes in the collection
156
where there are no existing labels corresponding to those themes. It would also be
interesting to investigate more situations in which the direct modelling of the words
has an advantage over using just the topics or just the words to prediction document
labels. For example, for image problems, the direct modelling of the effect of image
features on the image label may not give much of a benefit over modelling the effect of
the topics to which the images are allocated. It would also be interesting to investigate
a nonparametric ksLDA model to see if any of the advantages of the sHDP’s flexibility
can be carried over to the ksLDA. In addition, it would be interesting to see if adding
unlabelled data to train the model can result in better topics and thus improve label
predictions.
Supervised learning can be applied to the unsupervisedmodels described in Chapters 4
and 5. This would allow more ways for document metadata to be used to perform name
disambiguation. For example, the institution of authors, if available during training can
help to learn topics and groups that improve disambiguation performance. Addition-
ally, latent groups can be learnt that are more predictive of certain document metadata
or that are more closely aligned with the kind of groups that the user wishes to dis-
cover, such as latent groups based around the type of publication (journal, conference,
technical report), etc.
The use of Bayesian nonparametric mixture models in general and the advantages
that they bring with their infinite capacity also brings risks. The two main parameters
that influence the number of clusters in the models are the concentration parameter and
the base measure. A naive uninformative prior on the concentration parameter, for in-
stance, can result in a very informative prior for the number of clusters in the models.
This may be suitable for topic models where only a small number of topics relative to
the number of observations is preferred but becomes unsuitable when there may be a
very high number of latent clusters compared to the number of observations. If this is
the case, the prior can cause overclustering and it can be necessary to search for an
alternative prior that puts a relatively uniform distribution on the number of clusters.
The base measure also affects the number of clusters. For example, in topic modelling,
the symmetric Dirichlet base measure for the topics influences the number of resulting
topics. When the Dirichlet component values are high, topics are preferred that place
mass on many words and few topics are needed to represent the corpus. On the other
hand, when the component values are low, topics are preferred that place mass on few
words and many topics are needed to represent the corpus. Convergence can also be
an issue for inference in general Bayesian nonparametric models. Though these models
can take many iterations to converge, for my models for name disambiguation, the dis-
ambiguation performance stabilises well before sampling has converged. This means
157
that it is beneficial to run preliminary experiments with a small number of iterations
and to report results using the full set of iterations. Variational inference techniques
may also improve the speed of inference with these models but is more complex to
implement and only gives an approximation to the posterior.
The exchangeability assumptions on the authors and words are unrealistic but are ap-
propriate for the purpose of disambiguation, especially since a name’s position in the
author list would not be helpful in disambiguation. However, the models I proposed
assume a priori that each author contributes to a document equally whereas it is more
likely that authors earlier in the author list should be more closely associated with the
topics in the document. In general, the likelihood model for the names (or metadata
in general) made the biggest impact on performance. But it can still be important to
separate words and authors so that in the posterior, the words in the document can-
not dominate the authors in the author list. More methods of integrating free text and
metadata would probably yield fruitful results as would more work on choosing the cor-
rect base measure for a model. The models I proposed can be applied more generally to
resolution problems especially in cases when free text and metadata (or other extracted
information) need to be analysed together.
