Abstract. Statistical methods have been widely employed to study the fundamental
properties of language. In recent years, methods from complex and dynamical systems
proved useful to create several language models. Despite the large amount of studies
devoted to represent texts with physical models, only a limited number of studies
have shown how the properties of the underlying physical systems can be employed
to improve the performance of natural language processing tasks. In this paper, I
address this problem by devising complex networks methods that are able to improve
the performance of current statistical methods. Using a fuzzy classification strategy, I
show that the topological properties extracted from texts complement the traditional
textual description. In several cases, the performance obtained with hybrid approaches
outperformed the results obtained when only traditional or networked methods were
used. Because the proposed model is generic, the framework devised here could be
straightforwardly used to study similar textual applications where the topology plays
a pivotal role in the description of the interacting agents.

1. Introduction
The human language represents a major factor responsible for the success of our species;
and its written form is one of the main expression used to convey and share information.
Owing to the ubiquity of language in several contexts, many linguistic aspects have been
studied via the application of methods and tools borrowed from diverse scientific fields.
As a consequence, several findings related to the origins, organization and structure
of the language have been unveiled. One of the most fundamental patterns arising
from statistical analysis of huge amounts of text is the Zipf’s law, which states that
the frequency of the words decreases inversely to their rank [1–3]. Other fundamental
recurrent pattern is the Heap’s law, which states that the vocabulary size grows slowly
with the number of tokens of the document [4–6]. More recently, concepts from Physics
have been applied to model several language features. For example, with regard to long-
scale properties, concepts from dynamical systems have successfully been employed to

compare the burstiness of the spatial disbribution of words in documents [7, 8]. In a
similar fashion, the spatial distribution of words in documents and analogous systems
have also been studied in terms of level statistics [9], entropy [10] and intermittency
measurements [11]
A well-known approach to study written texts is the word adjacency network
model [12–14], which considers short-scale textual properties to form the networks.
In this representation, relevant words conveying meaning are modeled as nodes
and adjacency relationships are used to establish links. Using this model, several
characteristics of texts and languages have been inferred from statistical analyses
performed in the structure of networks [15]. Language networks have been increasingly
employed to understand theoretical linguistic aspects, such as the origins of fundamental
properties [16] and the underlying mechanisms behind language acquisition in early
years [17]. In practical terms, networks have been applied in the context of
machine translations [18], autommatic summarization [19], sense disambiguation [20,21],
complexity/quality analysis [22,23] and document classification [24]. Despite the relative
success of applying networks concepts to better understand language phenomena, in
many real-world applications attributes extracted from networked models have not
contributed to the advancement of the state of art. For example, when one considers
the document classification task, a strong dependency of network features on textual
characteristics have been observed. However, the best performance are still achieved
with traditional statistical natural language processing features. In this context, the
present study address this problem by devising methods that effectively take advantage
of network properties to boost the performance of the textual classification task. Here
I focus on the text classification based on stylistic features, where a text is classified
according to stylistic marks left by specific authors [25] or literary genres [26]. Upon
introducing a hybrid classifier relying on the fuzzy definition of supervised pattern
recognition methods [27], I show that the performance of style-based classifications
can be significantly improved when topological information is included in traditional
models. Given the generality of the proposed method, the framework devised here
could be applied to improve the characterization and description of many related textual
applications.
2. Representing texts as networks
There are several ways to map texts into networks [12,15,19,28–30]. The most suitable
form depends on the context of the application. In occasions where the semantics is
relevant, the words sharing some semantical relationship are linked [20, 22, 31–33]. In
a similar fashion, other semantic-based models link the words appearing in a given
context [34, 35] (e.g. in the same sentence or paragraph). A general model for
establishing significant “semantical” links between co-occurring elements was devised
in [36]. More specifically, the model considers the existence of a set of elements V =
{v1, . . . , vn}, which may occur in one or more sets of a given collection ξ = {S1, . . . , SN}.
3
Given two elements α ∈ V and β ∈ V , the model computes the probability p that more
than r sets in ξ contain both elements α and β as
pt =
∑
j≥r
p(j), (1)
where p(j) is the probability that α and β co-occur exactly j times in the same set.
Given a confidence level p0, the strength of the link between α and β is s = log(p0/pt).
In applications where the style (or structure) plays an important role, the links
among words are established according to syntactical relationships [19,30]. A well-known
approach for grasping stylistic features of texts is the word adjacency model [13,37,38],
which basically connect adjacent words in the text. Differently from the model devised
in [36], the word adjacency model captures the stylistic features of texts [39]. It has
been shown that the adjacency model is able to capture most of the syntactical links
with the benefit of being language independent. Despite being a simplification of the
syntactical analysis, the adjacency model has been employed in several contexts because
the topological properties of word adjacency and syntactical networks are similar. Such
high degree of similarity can be explained by the fact that most of the syntactical
links occurs among neighbouring words [30]. In the current paper, the traditional word
adjacency representation was adopted.
Before mapping the text into a word adjacency network, some pre-processsing steps
are usually applied. First, words conveying low semantic content, such as articles and
prepositions, are removed from the text. These words, referred to as stopwords, are
disregarded because they just serve to link content words. As a consequence, they can be
straightforwardly replaced by network edges. The remaining words are then lemmatized,
i.e. they are transformed to their canonical forms. To assist the lemmatization process,
all words are labeled with their part-of-speech tags. Particularly, in this study, I used
a model based on maximum entropy [40]. To exemplify the construction of a word
adjacency network, I show in table 1 the pre-processing steps performed in a short text.
The corresponding network is shown in figure 1.
3. Topological characterization of networks
A network can be defined as G = {V,E}, where V denotes the set of nodes and E
denotes the set of edges, which serve to link nodes. An unweighted network can be
represented by an adjacency matrix A = {aij}, where each element aij stores the
information concerning the connectivity of nodes i and j. If i and j are connected, then
aij = 1. Otherwise, aij = 0. Note that, in a undirected network devoid of self loops,
AT = A. Currently, there are several network measurements available to characterize
the topology of complex networks [41]. Here, I describe the main measurements applied
for text analysis:
• Degrees: the degree (k) is the number of edges connected to the node, i.e.
ki =
∑
j aij. A relevant feature related to the degree that has been useful for

remaining words are mapped to their canonical form via lemmatization. Note
that transformations fatigued 7→ fatigue and retinas 7→ retina occur during the
lemmatization step. The network obtained from the poem is illustrated in figure 1.

In text networks, both k(n) and ∆k(n) have been useful to quantify the structural
organization of texts [42].
• Accessibility: the accessibility measurement is a extension of the node degree
centrality [43]. It is defined as a normalization of the diversity measurement [43],
which quantifies the irregularity of a accessing neighbors through self-avoiding
random walks [43]. To define the accessibility, let Ph(i, j) be the probability
of a random walker starting at node i to reach node j in exactly h steps.
The heterogeneity of access to neighbors can be quantified with the diversity
measurement:
δ
(h)
i = −
∑
j
Ph(i, j) logPh(i, j), (4)
Given eq. 4, the accessibility (α) is computed as
α
(h)
i = exp(δ
(h)
i ). (5)
It can be shown that the accessibility is bounded according to the relation 0 ≤
α(h) ≤ nh, where nh is the number of nodes at the h-th concentric level [44]. An
example of the computation of the accessibility in a small network is shown in
figure 2. In the example, nodes 2, 3, 4 and 5 belong to the first concentric level and
nodes 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 belong to the second concentric level. When one considers a
regular access to the second level (red configuration), the accessibility corresponds
to the total number of nodes located at the h-th concentric level. When some
nodes are more accessed than others, the accessibility decreases because less nodes
are effectively accessed.
In textual networks, it has been shown that the accessibility is more advantageous
than other traditional centrality measurements as it is able to capture more
information at further hierarchical levels [44]. This measurement has been
successfully applied to detect core concepts in texts [19]. Furthermore, it has
also been employed to generate informative summaries [19]. A dependency of the
distribution of this measurement with stylistic features of text was observed in [45].
• Betweenness: the betweenness is a centrality measurement that considers that a
node is relevant if it is highly accessed via shortest paths. If nsit is the number of
geodesic paths between s and t passing through node i; and nst is the total number
of shortest paths linking s and t, then the betweenness is defined as:
Bi =
1
N2
∑
s
∑
t

(6)
In word adjacency networks, high frequent words usually take high values of
betweenness. However, some words may act as articulation points whenever
they link two semantical contexts or communities [46]. It has been shown that

Figure 2. Probabilities of transition from node 1 considering h = 2 steps for two
distinct configuration of links. The first configuration considers only the red edges and
the second one considers both red and blue edges. Note that, in the first configuration,
the probability to reach any node at the second level is the same. In this case,
α
(h=2)
1 = 5. When blue edges are included, nodes 7 and 9 tend to receive more visits
than the other nodes, according to the considered probabilities. For this reason, the
effective number of accessed nodes drops to α

1 = 4.71.
the betweenness is able to identify the generality of contexts in which a word
appears [47]. More specifically, domain-specific words tend to assume lower values
of betweenness when compared with more generic words.
• Assortativity: several real-world networks are formed of nodes with a specific
type of classification. For example, in social networks, individuals may be classified
by considering their age, sex or race. When analyzing the connectivity patterns
of networks, it might be relevant to study how distinct classes connect to each
other. This type of analysis is usually performed with the so-called assortativity
measurement [48]. The assortativity can be computed as the Pearson correlation
coefficient (r):

where e is the total number of edges. In word adjacency networks, the assortativity
quantifies how words with distinct frequency appear as neighbors.

• Clustering coefficient: the clustering coefficient (C) quantifies the local density
of neighbors of a given node. The local definition of the clustering coefficient is
given by the fraction of the number of triangles among all possible connected sets
of three nodes:
C = 3
∑
k>j>i
aijaikajk
[ ∑
k>j>i
aijaik + ajiajk + akiakj
]−1
. (8)
Similarly to the betweenness, the clustering coefficient is useful to detect words
appearing in generic contexts [47]. However, differently from the betweenness, the
clustering coefficient analyzes only the local neighborhood of nodes.
• Average shortest path length: the average shortest path length (l) is the typical
distance between any two nodes in the network. This measurement was used in this
paper because it has been useful in stylistic-based applications [47]. In texts, the
average shortest path length quantifies words relevance. More specifically, according
to this measurement, the most relevant words are those that are close to the hubs.
Most of the measurements described in this section are local measurements, i.e.
each node i possesses a value X̃i, where X̃ = {k, k(n),∆k(n), α, B, C, l}. For the
purposes of this paper, it is necessary to sum up the local measurements. The most
natural choice is to characterize the documents by computing the average 〈X̃〉, where
〈. . .〉 = N−1
∑N
i=1 . . . stands for the average computed over the N distinct words of the
text. A disadvantage associated with this type of summing procedure is that all words
receive the same weight, regardless of their number of occurrences in the text. To avoid
this potential problem, I also computed the average value 〈. . .〉∗ = η−1
∑η
i=1 . . . obtained
when only the η = 50 most frequent words are considered. The standard deviations ∆X̃
and the skewness γ(X̃) were also used to characterize the documents.
A drawback associated to the computation of local topological measurements in
word adjacency networks is the high correlation found between these measurements and
the node degree (i.e. the word frequency). To minimize this correlation, the following
procedure was adopted. Each of the measurements was normalized by the average
obtained over 30 texts produced using a word shuffling technique, where the frequencies
of words are preserved. If µ(X̃(R)) and σ(X̃(R)) are the average and deviation obtained
over the random realizations, the normalized measurement X and the error (X) related
to X are
X =

4. Traditional stylistic features
Frequency of words and characters
Traditional methods usually perform statistical analysis using specific textual
features [49]. An important contribution to the stylometry was introduced by Mosteller
and Wallace [50], which showed that the frequency of function words (such as any, of, a
and on) is useful to characterize the style in texts. Frequent words have also been used
in strategies devised by physicists where the distance of frequency ranks was used to
compute the similarity between texts [51–53]. Another relevant feature for characterizing
styles in texts is the frequency of character bigrams (i.e. a sequence of two adjacent
characters). These attributes have proven useful e.g. to detect the stylistic marks of
specific authors [54].
Intermittence
The uneven spatial distribution of words along texts is a feature useful for characterizing
the style of texts [10]. The quantification of the homogeneity of the distribution of words
along texts can be performed by using recurrence times, a standard measure employed
to study time series [55]. In texts, the concept of time is represented in terms of the
number of words occuring in a given interval. For each word i, the recurrence time
Tj is defined as the number of words appearing between two successive occurrences of
i plus one. For example, the recurrence times of the word “stone” in the lemmatized
text shown in table 1 are T1 = 1, T2 = 3, T3 = 3, T4 = 11, T5 = 1 and T6 = 5. If
a word i occurs Ni times in a text comprising NT words, it generates a sequence of
Ni − 1 recurrence times {T1, T2, . . . , TNi−1}. In order to consider the time Tf until the
first occurrence of i and the time Tl, the number of words between the last occurrence
of i and the last word of the text, the recurrence time TN = Tf + Tl is added to the
set of recurrence times of word i. As such, 〈T 〉 = NT/Ni, where 〈·〉 is the average over
distinct Tj’s. Note that the average recurrence time 〈T 〉 does not provide additional
information, since it only depends on the frequency. The intermittence (or burstiness)
of the word i is obtained from the coefficient of the variation of the recurrence times:
I = σT/〈T 〉 =
[
〈T 2〉
〈T 〉2
− 1
]1/2
. (11)
It has been shown that the intermittence has been useful to identify core concepts in
texts, even when a large corpus is not available. Relevant words usually take high values
of intermittency, i.e. I  1. Stopwords, on the other hand, are evenly distributed along
the text [45]. To illustrate the properties of the intermittency measurement, figure 3
shows the spatial distribution of the words long and Hobson in the book “Adventures of
Sally”, by P.G. Wodehouse. The frequency of these words are similar, yet their values of
intermittency are quite different. Note that, while the distribution of long is relatively
homogeneous, Hobson is unevenly distributed along the text. Because bursty concepts

are the most relevant words [10], in the example of figure 3, Hobson would be considered
a relevant character in the plot.
5. Supervised classification
In this section, I describe the two methods employed to combine distinct strategies of
classification. The objective here is to combine evidences from both traditional and
CN-based methods. Before introducing the methods for combining classifiers, the main
concepts concerning the supervised learning task are presented.
In a typical supervised learning task, two datasets are employed: the training and
the test dataset. The training dataset Xtr = {(x1, y1), (x2, y2), . . . , (xl, yl)} is the set
of instances whose classes are known beforehand. The first component of the tuples
xi = (f1 = a1, f2 = a2, . . .) represents the values of attributes used to describe the
i-th instance. The second element yi ∈ Y = {y1, y2, . . .} represents the class label
of the i-th training instance. In the supervised learning task, the objective is to
obtain the map x 7→ y. The quality of the map obtained is evaluated with the test
dataset Xts = {(xl, yl), (xl+1, yl+1) . . . , (xl+u, yl+u)}. The technique used to evaluate
the performance of the classifiers used in this study is the well-known 10-fold cross-
validation [56].
An usual procedure in classification tasks is the quantification of the relevance of
each attribute for the task. To quantify the relevance of attributes to discriminate the
data, several indices have been proposed [56]. A well-known index, the information gain,
quantifies the homogeneity of the set of instances in Xtr when the value of the attribute
is specified [57]. Whenever a single class prevails when the value of an attribute fk is
specified, the information gain associated to fk takes high values. Mathematically, the
information gain Ω is defined as
Ω(Xtr, fk) = H(Xtr)−H(Xtr|fk) (12)
where H(Xtr) is the entropy of the training dataset Xtr and H(Xtr|fk) is the entropy
10
of the training dataset when the k-th attribute is specified. The quantity H(Xtr|fk) is
computed as
H(Xtr|fk) =
1
|Xtr|
∑
v∈V (fk)
|{x ∈ Xtr|fk = v}| H({x ∈ Xtr|fk = v}) (13)
where V (Fk) is the set comprising all values taken by fk in Xtr.
Hybrid classifier
To define this classifier, consider the following definitions. Let mij be the strength
associating the i-th instance to the j-th class, where 0 ≤ mij ≤ 1. The term mij,
henceforth referred to as membership strength, can be interpret as the likelihood of
instance i to belong to class j. Note that the quantification of mij depends on the
classifier being used. A detailed description of methods for computing the membership
strength can be found in [27, 58–61]. Let m
(R)
ij be the membership strength obtained
when topological features of complex networks are used and m
(T )
ij the membership
strength obtained when traditional statistical features are analyzed. According to the
hybrid strategy, the combination of both topological and traditional methods is achieved
according to the following convex combination
m
(H)
ij = λm
(R)
ij + (1− λ)m
(T )
ij , (14)
where λ ∈ [0, 1] accounts for the weight associated to the topological strategy. Note that
the combination of evidences performed in equation 14 yields a membership strength
m
(H)
ij ranging in the interval [0, 1]. The final decision is then made according to the rule
ỹi = max
j
m
(H)
ij , (15)
where ỹi ∈ Y denotes the correct class label associated to the i-th test instance. In
practical applications, a screening on the λ can be useful to find its best value. However,
this process might be computationally unaffordable for very large datasets. In this case,
the process of finding the adequate value of the parameter can be made via application
of optimization heuristics [62,63].
To illustrate how the decision is performed with the hybrid algorithm, figure 4
shows the classification of a text modeled as a network. In the top panel, the central
network is the text whose class is to be inferred. The left and right networks represent
two networks in the training dataset. The node color denotes the node label, i.e. the
word associated to the node. In this example, two texts are semantically similar if they
share the same words. In the central panel, the scenario where the hybrid classified is set
with λ = 0.15 is considered. Because λ is close to zero, the classification is mostly based
on the number of shared words. In fact, the decision boundary in this case is created so
that the test instance is classified in the same class as the right training instance. The
bottom panel illustrates the decision made with λ = 0.85. Now, the topological features
of the text is the most prevalent feature used for the classification. As a consequence,
the boundary decision moves to the right side so that the test instance is classified as

the network r? might assume two possible classes: c1 and c2. An example for each of
these classes is provided (see networks r1 and r2). In the central panel, the decision
boundary obtained for λ = 0.15 is shown. Because λ takes a low value in this case, the
decision is mainly based on the number of shared nodes (words). As a consequence, r?
is classified as belonging to class c2. For higher values of λ, the topological features of
texts takes over. In the bottom panel, r? is classified as belonging to class c1 because
r? and r1 are topologically similar.
the same class as the left training instance. Note that, the test instance as belonging to
class c1 because the r1 and r? are topologically similar.
Tiebreaker classifier
Similarly to the hybrid classifier, this classification scheme uses as attributes both
traditional and topological features of texts modelled as networks. The objective of this
approach is to use the topological attributes only when the classification performed with

the gray instances are the test instances that should be classified with the class labels

the square is significantly far from the decision boundary (dashed line). Therefore, the
classification of this instance does not demand the use of topological features because
∆ ≥ θ in equation 16. Differently, the pentagon is located on the decision boundary.
Because ∆ < θ in this case, topological attributes are used to perform the classification.
According to the topological attributes (see right panel), the test instance represent

is shown in figure 5.
6. Results and discussion
The effectiveness of the combination of traditional textual features and topological
measurements of networks was evaluated in the context of two natural language
processing tasks. Both tasks rely upon the characterization of stylistic marks of texts.
The studied tasks were the authorship attribution and genre detection problems. The
13
classifiers chosen to compound the combining techniques were: kNN, Support Vector
Machines (SVM), Random Forest (RFO) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP). These
classifiers were chosen because they usually yield good accuracy rates with default
parameters [64].
6.1. Authorship recognition
In the authorship attribution task, the objective is to identify the authors of texts
whose identity is lacking [65]. The dataset employed here comprises books written
by eight authors: Arthur Conan Doyle (ACD), Bram Stoker (BRS), Charles Dickens
(CHD), Thomas Hardy (THH), Pelham Grenville Wodehouse (PGW), Hector Hugh
Munro (HHM) and Herman Melville (HME). To show how the topological properties of
the networks modelling books can be useful to improve the characterization of authors’
styles in texts, the following combination of attributes were considered:
• INT+CN: the intermittence of stopwords were considered along with the
topological measurements of the network modeling the text. As stopwords, I
considered all the words that appeared at least once in all books of the dataset.
According to the dataset, there is a total of 340 stopwords.
• FR+CN: the frequency of stopwords were considered along with the topological
attributes of the networks.
• BG+CN: the frequency of character bigrams were considered along with the
topological attributes of the networks. All the possibilities of character bigrams
(634) were considered in this analysis.
For each combination of attributes, the gain in performance when the topology is
considered as an additional feature is represented as:
∆Γ(x) =
ΓH(x)− ΓT
ΓT
, (17)
where ΓH(x) denotes the accuracy rate obtained with either the hybrid or tiebreaker
classifier and x is the corresponding parameter employed, i.e. λ for the hybrid classifier
and θ for the tiebreaker classifier. Figure 6 shows the values of ∆Γ(λ) when the kNN
is used to compose the hybrid classifier. The results obtained for additional values of
the parameter k are shown in table 2. Figure 6 also shows the maximum accuracy rate
obtained with the variation of λ:
∆Γmax = max
λ∈[0,1]
∆Γ(λ). (18)
With regard to the INT+CN combination, the addition of topological features of
texts yielded accuracy rates much higher than the ones obtained with intermittency
features alone, since ∆Γmax > 2 for k = {3, 4, 5}. Note that, in this case, the
network approach alone performed better than the method based solely on intermittency
features, because ∆Γ(λ = 1) > 1. This observation might explain the high gain
obtained when networks are included as an additional feature. As for the FR+CN
14
combination, the highest gain in performance was ∆Γmax = 1.197, which was obtained
for k = 5. The lowest gain in accuracy occurred for the BIG+CN combination. In
this case, the maximum gain was ∆Γmax = 1.070 for k = 5. When other classifiers
were used to compose the hybrid classifier, similar results have been found (see table
3): the highest and lowest improvement in performance occurred for the INT+CN
and BIG+CN combinations, respectively. In general, the hybrid classification that
combined traditional statistical features and topological measurements of networks
improved the classification performance in the authorship recognition task. Interestingly,
in several cases, the combination outperformed the accuracy rates obtained when the
compounding strategies were analyzes separately, i.e. ΓH(λ ∈]0, 1[) > ΓH(λ = 0) and
ΓH(λ ∈]0, 1[) > ΓH(λ = 1).

performance was observed in all three combinations of attributes. Finally, the tiebreaker
classifier built with the MLP only provided a gain in accuracy for the combination
INT+CN. While providing a gain in performance in several scenarios, the tiebreaker
technique usually performed worst than the hybrid classifications performed with the

The results in tables 2-5 confirms that the topology of networks modeling texts is
able to improve the characterization of texts because such textual description grasps
relevant patterns that are mostly disregarded by traditional statistical approaches.
This can be confirmed by optimized results obtained for λ∗ > 0 and θ∗ > 0. To
better understand the factors behind the discriminability power of the network model,
the relevance of each topological for discriminating authors was computed with the
information gain criterion. The best topological features were the standard deviation
of the accessibility at the third level (Ω(∆α(h=3)) = 1.07), the standard deviation of the
average neighboorhood degree (Ω(∆k(n)) = 1.05) and the average clustering coefficient
(Ω(〈C〉) = 0.60). An example of discriminability provided by the topological strategy
is shown in figure 8.

complement the traditional textual characterization for the style identification task [66].

Figure 8. Discriminability of authors obtained with two topological features of
complex networks modelling texts. Note that, using only two features, it was possible
to separate e.g. Alger from Melville. According to the information gain criterion, the
most relevant network features for the authorship identication task were the standard
deviation of the accessibility computed at the third level (Ω(∆α(h=3)) = 1.07) and the
standard deviation of the average neighboorhood degree (Ω(∆k(n)) = 1.05).
The dataset used was the Brown corpus [67], which comprises documents that are
classified either as informative prose (e.g. press reportage, popular folklore and scientific
manuscripts) or imaginative prose (e.g general fiction, romance and love stories).
Differently from the authorship attribution task, the objective here is to cluster together
documents written using the same style, regardless of their authorship.
The results obtained for the style identification in the Brown corpus using the
hybrid technique are shown in tables 6 and 7. Considering the INT+CN combination,
the highest gain in performance were 29.0% and 25.8% for the kNN (k = 4) and
SVM methods. Minor improvements in accuracy were observed for other combinations,
which might be explained by the high discriminability rates observed for the traditional
techniques based on the frequency of stopwords (Γ = 95.6%) and character bigrams
(Γ = 94.05%). The results obtained with the tiebreaker technique were inferior to those
obtained with the hybrid technique (results not shown). All in all, the results confirm
that the inclusion of topological attributes might also improve the characterization of
documents in the context of stylistic-based classification tasks. In this task, the most
relevant topological features were the skewness and deviation of the clustering coefficient
(Ω(γ(C)) = 0.172 and Ω(∆C) = 0.157). A visualization of the discriminability provided
by topological features is shown in figure 9.

7. Conclusions
In this study, I have shown that the styles of texts can be captured by measuring the
topological properties of the corresponding network representation. More important
than just to note a dependency between the structure of networks and stylistic
features of texts, this study devised techniques to combine traditional and topological
20
features, which were found to be of paramount importance to enhance the quality of
current classification strategies. Two traditional stylometry tasks were studied: the
authorship attribution and genre identification problems. In both tasks, the addition of
topological features provided an improvement in classification performance. The highest
improvement occurred with the hybrid classifier, which uses a linear convex combination
of features from distinct textual evidences. The different nature of the quantities used to
characterize texts suggests a complementary role in capturing distinct aspects of written
texts. Because the adequate choice of parameters for the proposed technique is far from
being a trivial task, I intend, as a future work, to devise a method that automatically
assigns a value of λ and Θ for each test instance.
