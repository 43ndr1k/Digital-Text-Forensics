Abstract
We study rank-frequency relations for phonemes, the minimal units that still relate to linguistic
meaning. We show that these relations can be described by the Dirichlet distribution, a direct
analogue of the ideal-gas model in statistical mechanics. This description allows us to dem-
onstrate that the rank-frequency relations for phonemes of a text do depend on its author.
The author-dependency effect is not caused by the author’s vocabulary (common words
used in different texts), and is confirmed by several alternative means. This suggests that it
can be directly related to phonemes. These features contrast to rank-frequency relations for
words, which are both author and text independent and are governed by the Zipf’s law.
Introduction
Language can be viewed as a hierarchic construction: phoneme, syllable, morpheme, word . . .
Each of these objects expresses meaning or participates in its formation, and consists of ele-
ments of the previous level, i.e. syllable consists of phonemes [1–3].
The lowest hierarchic level is phoneme, which is defined to be a representative for a group
of sounds that are not distinguishable with respect to their meaning-formation function in a
concrete language. For instance /r/ and /l/ are different phonemes in English, e.g. because row
and low which differ only by these phonemes are different words; see S1 Appendix for a list of
English phonemes. But they are the same phoneme in Japanese, since in that language there is
no danger of meaning-ambiguity upon mixing /r/ with /l/. (Different speech sounds that are
realizations of the same phoneme are known as allophones.) Thus the meaning is crucial for
the definition of the phoneme, although a single phoneme does not express a separate meaning
[1–3]. The next hierarchic level (syllable) indirectly participates in the definition of the pho-
neme, since the syllable bounds phonemes, i.e. there cannot be a phoneme which belongs to
two different syllables; e.g. diphthongs belong to the same syllable [1, 2].
The history of phoneme is a rich and complex one. It appeared in Greek and Indian linguis-
tic traditions simultaneously with atomistic ideas in natural philosophy [4–6]. Analogies
between atom and phoneme are still potent in describing complex systems [7, 8]. Within the
Western linguistic tradition the development of phoneme was for a while overshadowed by
related (but different) concepts of letter and sound [1, 2]. The modern definition of phoneme

goes back to late XIX century [2]. While it is agreed that the phoneme is a unit of linguistic
analysis [3], its psychological status is a convoluted issue [9–13]. Different schools of phonol-
ogy and psychology argue differently about it, and there is a spectrum of opinions concerning
the issue (e.g. perception of phonemes, their identification, reproduction etc) [12, 13]; see [9–
11] for recent reviews.
For defining a rank-frequency relation, one calculates the frequencies fr of certain constitu-
ents (e.g. words or phonemes) entering into a given text, lists them in a decreasing order
f1  f2  :::  fn; ð1Þ
and studies the dependence of the frequency fr on the rank r (its position in Eq (1), 1 r n).
This provides a coarse-grained description, because not the frequencies of specific phonemes
are described, but rather the order relation between them, e.g. the same form of the rank-fre-
quency relation in two different texts is consistent with the same phoneme having different fre-
quencies in those texts. The main point of employing rank-frequency relations is that they (in
contrast to the full set of frequencies) can be described via simple statistical models with very
few parameters.
Rank-frequency relations are well-known for words, where they comply to the Zipf’s law;
see [14, 15] for reviews. This law is universal in the sense that for all sufficiently long texts (and
their mixtures, i.e. corpora) it predicts the same power law shape fr / r−1 for the dependence of
the word frequency on its rank. It was shown recently that the representation of the word fre-
quencies via hidden frequencies—the same idea as employed in the present work—is capable
of reproducing both the Zipf’s law and its generalizations to low-frequency words (hapax lego-
mena) [16]. Due to its universality, the Zipf’s law for words cannot relate the text to its author.
The rank-frequency relation for morphemes and syllables was so far not studied systemati-
cally. Ref. [17] comes close to this potentially interesting problem, since it studies the rank-fre-
quency relations of Chinese characters, which are known to represent both morpheme and
syllable (in this context see also [18–20]). This study demonstrated that the Zipf’s law still
holds for a restricted range of ranks. For long texts this range is relatively small, but the fre-
quencies in this range are important, since they carry out’ 40% of the overall text frequency.
It was argued that the characters in this range refer to the most polysemic morphemes [17].
There are also several works devoted to the rank-frequency relations of phonemes and let-
ters [21–27]. One of first works is that by Sigurd, who has shown that the phoneme rank-fre-
quency relations are not described by the Zipf’s law [21]. He also noted that a geometric
distribution gives a better fit than the Zipf’s law. Other works studied various few-parameter
functions—e.g. the Yule’s distribution—and fitted it to the rank-frequency relations for pho-
nemes of various languages; see [27] for a recent review of that activity.
The present work has two motivations. First, we want to provide an accurate description of
rank-frequency relation for phonemes. It is shown that such a description is provided by postu-
lating that phoneme frequencies are random variables with a given density. The ranked fre-
quencies are then recovered via the order statistics of this density. This postulate allows to
restrict the freedom of choosing various (theoretical) forms of rank-frequency relations, since
—as developed in mathematical statistics [28, 29]—the idea of the simplest density for proba-
bility of probability allows to come up with the unique family of Dirichlet densities. This family
is characterized by a positive parameter β, which allows quantitative comparison between pho-
neme frequencies for different authors. From the physical side, the Dirichlet density is a direct
analogue of the ideal gas model from statistical mechanics, while β relates to the inverse tem-
perature. Recall that the ideal-gas model provides a simple and fruitful description of the
coarse-grained (thermodynamic) features of matter starting from the principles of atomic and
Rank-Frequency Relations for Phonemes

molecular physics [30]. Thus we substantiate the atom-phoneme metaphor, that so far was
developed only qualitatively [7, 8].
Our second motivation for studying rank-frequency relations for phonemes is whether they
can provide information on the author of the text, and thereby attempt at clarifying the psycho-
logical aspect of phonemes. As seen below, the Dirichlet density not only leads to an accurate
description of phoneme rank-frequency relations, but it also allows to establish that the fre-
quencies of phonemes do depend on the author of the text. We corroborate this result by an
alternative means.
The closest to the present approach is the study by Good [22] which was developed in Refs.
[23–25]. These authors applied the same idea on hidden probabilities as here, but they
restricted themselves by the flat density, which is a particular case β = 1 of the Dirichlet density
[22–24]. Superficially, this case seems to be special, because it incorporates the idea of non-
informative (unknown) probabilities (in the Bayesian sense) [31]. However, the development
of the Bayesian statistics has shown that the β = 1 case of the Dirichlet density is by no means
special with respect the prior information [31]. Rather, the whole family of Dirichlet densities
(with β> 0 being a free parameter) qualifies for this role [32].
This paper is organized as follows. Next section discusses the Dirichlet density and its fea-
tures. There we also deduce explicit formulas for the probabilities ordered according to the
Dirichlet density. Then, we analyze the data obtained from English texts written by different
authors and show that it can be described via the Dirichlet density. There we also demonstrate
(in different ways including non-parametric methods) that rank-frequency relations for pho-
nemes are author-dependent. Next, we show that the author-dependency effect is not caused
by common words used in different texts. We summarize in the last section.
Materials and Methods
Ideal-gas models
The general idea of applying ideal-gas models in physics [30] is that for describing coarse-
grained features of certain physical systems, interactions between their constituents (atoms or
molecules) can be accounted for superficially (in particular, neglected to a large extent). Instead,
one focusses on the simplest statistical description that contains only a few parameters (e.g. tem-
perature, volume, number of particles etc) [30]. In physics this simplest descriptions amounts to
the Gibbs density [30]. Its analogue in mathematical statistics is known as the Dirichlet density,
and is explained below. Ideal gas models in physics are useful not only for gases—where interac-
tions are literally weak—but also for solids, where interactions are important, but their detailed
structure is not, and hence it can be accounted for in a simplified way [30].
Following these lines, we apply below the Dirichlet density to phoneme frequencies observed
in a given text. More precisely, the ordered frequencies generated by the Dirichlet density are
compared with observed (and ordered) frequencies of phonemes in a given text. This ordering
of frequencies amounts to a rough and simplified account of (inter-phoneme) interactions, and
suffices for an accurate description of the rank-frequency relations for phonemes; see below.

The random variables Θ1, . . .,Θn (with realizations θ1, . . ., θn) are independent modulo the
constraint that they sum to 1; see Eq (2). In this sense Eq (2) is the simplest density for proba-
bilities. Now Eq (2) for a particular case βk = β (which is most relevant for our purposes) can be
given the following statistical-physics interpretation: if ln 1yk
 
is interpreted as the energy of k
[33–35], then β − 1 becomes the inverse temperature for an ideal gas. It is useful to keep this
analogy in mind, when discussing further features of the Dirichlet density.
Consider the subset (θ1, . . ., θm) (m< n) of probabilities (θ1, . . ., θn). If (θ1, . . ., θm) should
serve as new probabilities, they should be properly normalized. Hence we define new random
variables as follows:
ð~y1; :::; ~ynÞ ¼ ðŷ1; :::; ŷm; ymþ1; :::ynÞ; ŷk ¼
ykPm
i¼1 yi
; k ¼ 1; :::;m: ð3Þ
The joint probability Pð~y1; :::; ~ynÞ now reads from Eq (2):
Pð~y1; :::; ~ynÞ ¼ Dðŷ1; :::; ŷmjb1; :::; bmÞXðymþ1; :::; ynÞ; ð4Þ
where the precise form of X is not relevant for the message of Eq (4): if we disregard some
probabilities and properly re-normalize the remaining ones, the kept probabilities follow the
same Dirichlet density and are independent from the disregarded ones [28]. This means that
we do not need to know the number of constituents before applying the Dirichlet density. This
feature is relevant for phonemes, because their exact number is to a large extent a matter of
convention, e.g. should English diphthongs be regarded as separate phonemes, or as combina-
tions of a vowel and a semi-vowel.
Condition Eq (4) (called sometimes neutrality), together with few smoothness conditions,
determines the shape Eq (2) of the Dirichlet density [29].
Assuming n free parameters βk for n phoneme frequencies does not amount to any effective
description. Hence below we employ Eq (2) with
bk ¼ b; ð5Þ
for describing the ranked phoneme frequencies. This implies that the full vector (β1, . . ., βn) is
replaced by a certain characteristic value β, which is to be determined from comparing with
data. To provide some intuition on β, let us note from Eq (2) that a larger value of β leads to
more homogeneous density (many events have approximately equal probabilities). For βk! 0
the region θk’ 0 is the most probable one.
Distribution of ordered probabilities (order statistics)
The random variables Θ1, . . .,Θn (whose realizations are θ1, . . ., θn in Eq (2)) are now put in a
non-increasing order:
Yð1Þ  :::  YðnÞ: ð6Þ
This procedure defines new random variables, so called order statistics of the original ones
[36]. We are interested by the marginal probability density of Θ(r). It is difficult to obtain this
object explicitly, because the initialΘ1, . . ., Θn are correlated random variables. However, we
can explicitly obtain from Eq (2) a two-argument function that suffices for calculating the

In the next section we shall see that the sequence of ordered probabilities fr [cf. Eq (1)] can
be generated via Eq (7). To this end, the empiric quantities fr will be compared to f̂ r ¼ hyðrÞi;
cf. Eq (9). The rationale for using the average is that for parameters we are interested in—
where n’ 40 − 50 (for English phonemes n = 44) and 0.5 β 1—we get from Eqs (7)–(9)
that relative fluctuations around the average f̂ r  hyðrÞi are small. Namely, εr  ðhy2ðrÞi 
hyðrÞi2Þ=hyðrÞi2≲0:02 for all values of r, excluding r n, i.e. very low frequency phonemes. This
is shown in Fig 1 for a particular value β = 0.8. Note that εr is not a monotonic function of r: it
is smallest for middle ranks. (Even for those values of r, where εr ’ 1, f̂ r ¼ hyðrÞi can still
describe the empiric frequencies fr, as seen below.) Now there is a simpler approximate formula
for f̂ r ¼ hyðrÞi that is deduced from Eq (9) [see S2 Appendix]:

Fig 1 shows that f̂ r obtained from Eq (10) indeed approximates well hθ(r)i for almost all
ranks r.
Results and Discussions
Fitting rank-frequency relations to the Dirichlet distribution
We studied 48 English texts written by 16 different, native-English authors; see Table 1 and S3
Appendix. For each text we extracted the phoneme frequencies ffrgnr¼1 and ordered them as in
Eq (1); the list of English phonemes is given in S1 Appendix. The transcription of words into
phonemes was carried out via the software PhoTransEdit, which is available at [37]. This is a rela-
tively slow, but very robust software, since it works by checking each word in the phonetic dictio-
nary. Thus it can err only on those unlikely cases, when the word is not found in the dictionary.
It is important to specify from which set of words (of a text) one extracts the phoneme fre-
quencies. Two natural choices are possible here: either one employs all words of the text, or dif-
ferent words of the text (i.e. multiple occurrences of the same word are neglected). We shall
study both cases. For clarity reasons, we shall present our results by focussing on the three
authors mentioned in Table 1; see also Tables 2 and 3 in this context. Three texts by three authors
is in a sense the minimal set-up for described effects. We stress that other texts we studied fully
corroborate our results; they are partially described in Table 4 below and in S3 Appendix.
The ordered set ffrgnr¼1 of phoneme frequencies for each text was compared with the predic-
tion ff̂ r ¼ hyðrÞignr¼1 of the Dirichlet density [see Eq (9)]. Here the parameter β [cf. Eqs (2) and

A good fitting means that R2 is close to 1. We found that (as functions of β) SSerr and 1 − R
2
minimize simultaneously.
Examples of fitting curves for phoneme rank-frequency relations are presented in Fig 2.
The fitting parameters are given in Tables 2 and 3. Note that the fitting values of R2 are good.
The group of most frequent eight phonemes reads [see S1 Appendix]: /ı/, /ə/, /n/, /s/, /t/, /l/,
/d/, /r/. The concrete ranking between them depends on the text, but the most frequent one
is normally /ı/.
Tables 2 and 3 show that the texts by the same author have closer values of β than those
written by different authors; see also Figs 3 and 4. This can be quantified via the following three

where A, D and T refer, respectively to Austen, Dickens and Tolkien [see Table 1]. The indices i
and j run over the texts by the same author, while k refer to different authors, e.g. i, j = {1, 2, 3}
(Austen) and k = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} (not Austen). The minimization (or maximization) in Eqs
(14)–(16) goes over indicated indices.
Eqs (14)–(16) hold both for phoneme frequencies extracted from different words and from
all words of a text; cf. Tables 2 and 3. For instance, b[all words](A) = 0.02, b[all words](D) = 0.02,
b[all words](T) = 0. The latter is the only minor exclusion from Eqs (14)–(16).
Thus the set fbig9i¼1 fragments into three clusters that refer to different authors. Note that
b½diff : wordsðaÞ > b½all wordsðaÞ; a ¼ A; D; T: ð17Þ
Hence different words display the author-dependency in a stronger form; this is confirmed
below by other methods.
The author-dependency of phoneme rank-frequency relation is unexpected, because the rank-
frequency relation for words (which consists of phonemes) follows the Zipf’s law whose shape is
independent of the author [14–16]. Note that the few most frequent phonemes and the least fre-
quent ones appear to fit best the theoretical prediction; cf. Fig 2. This feature again contrasts the
rank-frequency relation for words, where it is known that high-frequency words—these are
mostly the functional words, e.g. and, or—do hold the Zipf’s law worst than other words [16]. On
the other hand, the moderate-frequency phonemes deviate most from the prediction of the
Dirichlet curve; cf. Fig 2. This effect is not statistical, since fluctuations around the average are
most suppressed for moderate-frequency phonemes; see after Eq (9) and Figs 1 and 2.
Another pertinent result is that [see Tables 2 and 3]
b½diff : wordsi > b
½all words
i ; i ¼ 1; :::; 9; ð18Þ
i.e. the phoneme distribution obtained from different words is more homogeneous [see our dis-
cussion after Eq (5)], because for all words the frequency of high-rank phonemes is amplified
due to multiple usage of frequent words.
Note that the above three texts belong to one genre (novels) and concern only three authors.
Hence we studied other 13 native-English authors who created in XIX’th and the first half of
Fig 2. Rank-frequency relation (black circles) and the fitting with Dirichlet distribution (red line). (a) Left figure: text TC, where frequencies were
extracted from all words. (b) Right figure: text PP, where different words were employed; see Table 1 for the description of texts.

particular, Table 4 presents the values of β extracted from different texts of 5 authors. These
authors were selected so that their language differences due to social, temporal and professional
backgrounds are minimized. In addition, we selected 4 of them to be professional scientists,
since the language of scientific works is normally more unified. Lyell, Darwin, Wallace, and
Spenser were naturalists, while the fifth author (H.G. Wells) held a PhD in biology and wrote a
lot about scientists. Lyell strongly influenced Darwin, while Darwin andWallace were close col-
leagues. All these three naturalists influenced Spenser andWells. However, Table 4 shows that
the values of β for these 5 authors are clearly different and hold analogues of Eqs (14)–(16).
We want to stress that β anyhow changes in a bounded interval: 0.5 < β< 1. Hence if one
takes sufficiently many authors, their values of β will start to overlap. In our study of (overall)

16 authors we confirmed this expectation; see S2 Appendix. However, these overlaps are acci-
dental, i.e. the overlapping authors can be easily distinguished by alternative means. In partic-
ular, their phoneme distributions can be robustly distinguished via distances, as described
below.
Distance between phoneme frequencies
The author-dependency of phoneme rank-frequency relation is corroborated by looking
directly at suitable distances between the ranked phoneme frequencies in different texts. We
choose to work with the variational distance
r1ðijÞ ¼
1
2
Xn
k¼1
j fk½i  fk½j j; ð19Þ
where ffk½ignk¼1 are the ordered phoneme frequencies in the text i. We shall also employ a more
fine-grained (detail-specific) distance. Let f[α|i] be the frequency of phoneme α in text i (α = 1,
. . ., n, i = 1, . . ., 9). We can now define [cf. Eq (19)]
r0ðijÞ ¼
1
2
Xn
a¼1
j f ½aji  f ½ajj j: ð20Þ
Now ρ0(ij) = 0 only if f[α|i] = f[α|j]. It is seen from Tables 5–7 that ρ0(ij)> ρ1(ij), as it should
be, because ρ1(ij) is less sensitive to details (i.e. it is more coarse-grained).
To motivate the choice of the variational distance r0 ¼ 12
Pn
a¼1 j pa  qa j between two sets of
probabilities fpagna¼1 and fqagna¼1, let us recall an important feature of this distance [38]:
r0 ¼ maxOj
P
a2Oðpa  qaÞj, where the maximization goes over all sub-sets O of {1, . . ., n}.
Thus ρ0 refers to the (composite) event that gives the largest probability difference between
fpagna¼1 and fqagna¼1.
Tables 5 and 6 refer, respectively, to phoneme frequencies extracted from all words and dif-
ferent words of the text. These tables show that phoneme rank-frequency relations between the
texts written by the same author are closer to each other—in the sense of distances ρ0 and ρ1—
than the ones written by different authors. This is also seen on Figs 3 and 4.
To quantify these differences, consider the following inequalities that define clustering with
respect to authors (see Table 1 for numbering of texts, and note that ρλ(ij) = ρλ(ji) for the
Table 5. Distances ρ0 and ρ1 between texts; see Table 1 and Eqs (20) and (19) for the definition of ρ0 and ρ1. The phoneme frequencies are extracted
from all words of the text. Eqs (24) and (25) compare the distances from all words with those from different words.

where A, D and T refer, respectively to Austen, Dickens and Tolkien; cf. Eqs (21)–(23) with
Eqs (14)–(16). For example, the maximal distance Eq (20) between texts by Austen (see
Table 1) is denoted by max fr0ðijÞgi<j;i;j¼1;2;3, while min fr0ðklÞgk¼1;2;3;l¼4;5;6;7;8;9 is the minimal
distance between texts written by Austen and those written by Dickens and Tolkien. Note that
Eqs (21)–(23) hold as well for other 13 authors we analyzed; see S3 Appendix for examples.
The meaning of Eqs (21)–(23) can be clarified by looking at an authorship attribution
task: let several texts i = 1, 2, 3 by (for example) Austen are at hands, and one is given an
unknown text α. The question is whether α could also be written by Austen. If now maxi
[ρλ(iα)]maxi<j [ρλ(ij)], we have an evidence that α is written by Austen.
We stress that there are no fitting parameters in Eqs (20)–(23). Our data (cf. Tables 5 and 6)
holds eleven (out of twelve) inequalities Eqs (21)–(23) for phoneme frequencies extracted both
from different and from all words of the text. There is only one exclusion:

after excluding the words that are common for both compared texts; see Eqs (26) and (27) for comparison with the situation without excluding common
words.

z½all words1 ðTÞ ¼ 0:00207, which is by an order of magnitude smaller than the respective fre-
quencies [cf. Eq (23)]. Apart of this minor exclusion, we confirm the above prediction
(obtained via the fitted values of β) on the author-dependency for phoneme frequencies.
Data shown in Tables 5 (all words) and 6 (different words) also imply the following inequal-
ities [confirming Eq (17)]
z½diff : wordsl ðaÞ > z½all wordsl ðaÞ; l ¼ 0; 1; a ¼ A; D; T: ð24Þ
Another pertinent feature is that the distances ρ0 and ρ1 between texts written by the same
author hold
r½all wordsl ðijÞ > r½diff : wordsl ðijÞ;
l ¼ 0; 1; ðijÞ ¼ f ð12Þ; ð13Þ; ð23Þ; ð45Þ; ð46Þ; ð78Þ; ð79Þ; ð89Þ g:
ð25Þ
Seventeen out of eighteen relations Eq (25) hold for our data; see Tables 5 and 6, where we
present the distances ρ0 and ρ1 for phoneme frequencies deduced from, respectively, all words
and different words of the texts. The only exclusion in Eq (25) is
r½diff : words0 ð78Þ  r½all words0 ð78Þ ¼ 0:02853 0:02584 ¼ 0:00269. No definite relations exist
between r½all wordsl and r
½diff : words
l for texts written by different authors. One can interpret Eq
(25) as follows. When going from different words to all words of the text, the majority of fre-
quent words are not author-specific: they are mostly key-words (that are specific to the text,
but not necessarily to the author) and functional words (e.g. and, or, of, but) that are again not
author-specific.
Taken together, Eq (24) and Eq (25) imply that the clustering with respect to authors is bet-
ter visible for frequencies extracted from different words of the texts (the inter-cluster distance
increases, whereas the intra-cluster distance decreases). The same effect was obtained above via
fitted values of β’s; see Eq (17).
The origin of the author-dependency effect is not in common words
One possible reason for the author-dependency of phoneme frequencies is that the effect is due
to the vocabulary of the author. In this scenario the similarity between phoneme frequencies in
text written by the same author would be caused by the fact that these texts have sufficiently
many common words that carry out the same phonemes.
Texts written by the same author do have a sizeable number of common words, as was
already noted within the authorship attribution research [39, 40]. We confirm this result in
Table 8, where it is seen that the fraction of common words holds the analogues of Eqs (21)–
(23). Hence this fraction also shows the author-dependency effect.
In order to understand whether the author-dependency of phoneme frequencies can be
explained via common words, we excluded from different words of texts i and k the common
words of those texts [i, k = 1, . . ., 9, see Table 1], re-calculated phoneme frequencies, and only
then determined the respective distances r½no comm: words0 ðikÞ and r½no comm: words1 ðikÞ. If the expla-
nation via common words holds, they will not show author-dependency. This is however not
the case: the effect is there because relations Eqs (21)–(23) do hold for them
z½no comm: wordsl ðaÞ > 0; l ¼ 0; 1; a ¼ A; D; T: ð26Þ
Eq (26) is deduced from Table 7, where we present the distances ρ0 and ρ1 for the situation,
where the common words are excluded.
After excluding the common words the author-dependency did not get stronger in the sense
of Eq (25), because the data of Tables 6 (different words) and 7 (excluded common words)

imply for texts written by the same author
r½no comm: wordsl ðijÞ > r½diff : wordsl ðijÞ; l ¼ 0; 1;
ðijÞ ¼ f ð12Þ; ð13Þ; ð23Þ; ð45Þ; ð46Þ; ð78Þ; ð79Þ; ð89Þ g:
ð27Þ
In this context recall Eqs (24) and (25). But it also did not get weaker [cf. Eq (24) and Eqs (21)–
(23)], because
z½no comm: wordsl ðaÞ > z½diff : wordsl ðaÞ; l ¼ 0; 1; a ¼ A; D; T; ð28Þ
as seen from Tables 6 and 7, which refer, respectively, to different words and the excluded com-
mon words.
Conclusion
Phonemes are the minimal building blocks of the linguistic hierarchy that still relate to mean-
ing. A coarse-grained description of phoneme frequencies is provided by rank-frequency rela-
tions. For describing these relations we followed the qualitative analogy between atoms and
phonemes [7, 8]. Atoms amount to a finite (and not very large) number of discrete elements
from which the multitude of substances and materials are built [30]. Likewise, a finite number
of phonemes can construct a huge number of texts [8].
The simplest description of an (sufficiently dilute) atomic system is provided via the ideal
gas model [30]. By studying 16 native-English authors, we show that the rank-frequency rela-
tions for phonemes can be described via the ordered statistics of the Dirichlet density, the direct
analogue of the ideal gas model in statistics. In particular, though the number of phonemes is
not very large (English has 44 phonemes), it is just large enough to validate the statistical
description. The single parameter of the Dirichlet density corresponds to the (inverse) temper-
ature of the ideal gas in statistical physics. It appears that the most frequent phonemes fit the
Dirichlet distribution much better than others. This contrasts to the rank-frequency relations
for words, where the Zipf’s law holds worst for the most frequent words.
The fitting to the Dirichlet density uncovers an important aspect of phoneme frequencies:
they depend on the author of the text. This fact is seen for authors who created their works in
various genres (novels, scientific texts, journal papers), and also for authors whose language-
dependence on social, temporal and educational background has been minimized (e.g. the
closely inter-related group of English naturalists including Darwin, Wallace, Lyell, and
Table 8. The fraction p of commonwords between texts given in Table 1. Now p is defined as follows. Let n(i) and n(ij) be, respectively, the number of dif-
ferent words in text i and the number of common words in texts i and j. We define: p(ij) = n(ij)/(n(i) + n(j) − n(ij)), where 0 p(ij) 1. This is the number of com-
mon words divided over the number of all different words in texts i and j. As seen from the data below, analogues of Eqs (21)–(23) hold with 1 − p(ij) instead of
ρλ(ij).

Spencer). We confirmed this result via a parameter-free method that is based on calculating
distances between phoneme frequencies of different texts. Again, this contrasts to the Zipf’s
law for rank-frequency relations of words whose shape is author-independent.
It is well-known that certain aspects of text-statistics display author-dependency, and this is
applied in various author attribution tasks; see e.g. [38–43] for recent reviews. In particular, this
concerns frequencies of functional words. The fact that author-dependency is seen on such a
coarse-grained level as rank-frequency relations may mean that phoneme frequencies can be
useful for existing methods of authorship attribution [40–43]. This should be clarified in future.
A straightforward reason for explaining the author-dependency effect of phoneme frequencies
would be that it is due to the author’s vocabulary, as reflected by common words in texts written
by the same author. The previous section has shown that such an explanation is ruled out.
Then we are left with options that the effect is due to storing (with different frequencies)
syllables or/and phonemes. If syllable frequencies have author-dependency, this could result
to author-dependent phoneme frequencies, because there are specific rules that (at least
probabilistically) determine the phoneme composition of syllables [44]. But note that sylla-
bles are in several respect similar to words (and not phonemes): (i) there are many of them;
e.g. English has more than 12000 syllables. (ii) There is large gap between frequent and infre-
quent syllables [45, 46] (cf. with the hapax legomena for words). (iii) There are indications
that syllables are stored in a syllabic lexicon that in several ways is similar to the mental lexi-
con that stores words [45, 46].
The second possibility would mean that the authors store phonemes [11], and this will pro-
vide a statistical argument for psychological reality of phonemes. Note that the issue of psycho-
logical reality of a phoneme is not settled in modern phonology and psychology, various
schools arguing pro and contra of it; see [9–13] for discussions. And then both these options
might be present together. Thus further research—also involving rank-frequency relations for
syllables—is needed for clarifying the situation.
The presented methods can find applications in animal communication systems. In this
context, we recall an interesting argument [47]. The number of phonemes in languages roughly
varies between 20 and 50. Indeed, the average number of phonemes in European languages is
’ 37. (English has 44 phonemes, but if diphthongs are regarded as combinations of a vowel
and a semi-vowel this number reduces to 36.) In tonal languages the overall number of pho-
nemes is larger, e.g. it is*180 for Chinese. (The tone produces phonemes and not allophones,
since they do change the meaning.) But the number of phonemes without tones still complies
with the above rough bound. Since Old Chinese (spoken in 11 to 7’th centuries B.C.) lacked
tones, the tonal phonemes of modern Chinese evolved from their non-tonal analogues that
complies with the above number [48]. By its order of magnitude this number (*20 − 50) coin-
cides [47] with the number of ritualized (i.e. sufficiently abstract) signals of animal communi-
cation, which is also stable across different species [49]. (An example of this are gestures of
apes.) This number is sufficiently large to invite the application of the presented statistical
methods to signals of animal communication. And the stability of this number may mean that
there are further similarities (to be yet uncovered) between phonemes and ritualized signals.
