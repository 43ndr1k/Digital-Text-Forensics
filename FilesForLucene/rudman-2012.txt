The State of Non-Traditional
Authorship Attribution Studies—2012:
Some Problems and Solutions
Joseph Rudman
In 1998, an article appeared in Computers and the Humanities with the following
abstract:
The statement, ‘‘Results of most non traditional authorship attribution studies are not
accepted as definitive,’’ is explicated. A variety of problems in these studies are listed
and discussed: studies governed by expediency; a lack of competent research; flawed
statistical techniques; corrupted primary data; lack of expertise in allied fields; a
dilettantish approach; inadequate treatment of errors. Various solutions are suggested:
construct a correct and complete experimental design; educate the practitioners; study
style in its totality; identify and educate the gatekeepers; develop a complete theoretical
framework; form an association of practitioners.1
Fourteen years later we can see a muddled but gradual advancement in some areas.2
However, all of the old problems not only remain but many have been exacerbated. A
slew of new, unproven methodologies, new problems, and new controversies have the field
in turmoil. This paper uses that earlier publication as a starting point to assess the
present state of non-traditional authorship attribution studies—its successes, failures,
problems, and prospects.
When I have had to criticize particular methods or scholars it has not been without
respect for the courage with which they have addressed themselves to significant
problems in a collective enterprise in which failure has often been as instructive as
success.3
This paper looks back at the 1997 ACH-ALLC conference at Queens University where
a session was presented by Harald Baayen, David I. Holmes, Joseph Rudman, and
Fiona J. Tweedie, ‘‘The State of Authorship Attribution Studies’’, and also looks back

at a subsequent article that I published in Computers and the Humanities, ‘‘The State
of Authorship Attribution Studies: Some Problems and Solutions’’.4 It goes on to
look at the more than eight hundred studies and papers dealing with non-traditional
attribution studies that have been promulgated in the fifteen years since that session.
It is again time to step back, reflect on, and evaluate the state of non-traditional
authorship attribution studies.
1. Successes
These past fifteen years have been exciting with many advances in the field, for
example:
1. Arguably, the most significant development in the field is the large contingent of
computer scientists that have brought their perspectives to the table—led by
Shlomo Argamon, Patrick Juola, Moshe Kopple, and a host of others.5
2. Sir Brian Vickers’ and Marcus Dahl’s ‘‘London Authorship Forum’’.
3. The DIMACS Working Group at Rutgers University on Authorship
Attribution.
4. John Burrows’ ‘‘Busa Award’’ and his ‘‘Member of the Order of Australia’’. His
Delta and its improvements by himself, Shlomo Argamon, David Hoover, Peter
W.H. Smith, and others.
5. Forensic Linguistics and the gatekeeping impositions of the Daubert Triangle.6
6. Successful and well-publicized studies such as Donald W. Foster’s Primary
Colors work, David I. Holmes’ Cassandre work, and Cyril and Dominique
Labbé’s work on French playwrights.7
7. The continuing advances by practitioners such as John Burrows, David Hoover,
Sir Brian Vickers, David Holmes, Hugh Craig, Maciej Eder, and Jan Rybicki.
8. John Nerbonne’s reissue of and introduction to Frederick Mosteller and David
L. Wallace’s Applied Bayesian and Classical Inference: The Case of ‘‘The Federalist
Papers’’.8
9. Patrick Juola’s ‘‘Ad Hoc Authorship Attribution Competition’’ and his National
Science Foundation funded JGAAP project.9
10. The many other software initiatives: for example, Jan Christoph Meister’s
CATMA; Carole E. Chaski’s ALIAS; Maciej Eder’s ‘‘R script for Stylometry’’.
Victoria Guillén-Nietro does a good job explicating the state of the art software
for Forensic Linguistics.10

14. The annual ‘‘Chicago Colloquium on Digital Humanities’’.
15. Jasmine Novak, Prabhakar Raghaven, and Andrew Tomkins’ research at IBM on
anti-aliasing via content analysis.13
2. Acceptance
However, contrary to what many practitioners of the non-traditional proclaim, there
is not widespread acceptance of non-traditional authorship attribution. For example,
in my area, eighteenth-century English Literature, most scholars feel that there is a
long way to go before they accept the results.14 Many respected linguists remain
sceptical:
I am still unconvinced that such forms of analysis [probabilistic] are effective, but
this may reflect my own lack of understanding of their statistical basis. Even
supporters of such methods nowadays caution against excessively strong statements
based on them.15
In addition to the lengthy list of problems and arguments in my earlier paper, the
past fifteen years have brought many additional high-profile problems and
disagreements with the concomitant negative publicity, for example:
1. Donald Foster’s misattribution of A Funerall Elegie. He recanted the attribution
to Shakespeare after traditional scholarship ‘‘proved’’ him wrong. Foster now
agrees that his much ballyhooed attribution study used an inadequate base of
control texts.16
2. Foster’s misattribution of the Jon Benét Ramsey ransom note: after first
saying—absolutely and unequivocally—that the late Patricia Ramsey (Jon
Benét’s mother) did not write the kidnapping ransom note, he later concluded
that it was actually Patricia Ramsey who wrote it.17
3. John Burrows’ attribution and then de-attribution of ‘‘A Vision’’: in 1988,
J. F. Burrows and A. J. Hassall reported that ‘‘A Vision’’ (from Sarah Fielding’s

Familiar Letters) is probably Henry Fielding’s work.18 In 1989, Burrows made a
slight modification, saying that ‘‘A Vision’’ was written by Henry and much
revised by Sarah.19 Then in 2008, Linda Bree quotes an unpublished paper by
Burrows, stating that, ‘‘the work [‘A Vision’] after all falls into Sarah’s linguistic
patterns rather than Henry’s.’’20 Burrows’ shift is something that every good
scientist should do—search for errors or improvements in their experimental
methodology and self-correct. But this ‘‘up and down’’ reporting of results has
added to the ‘‘let’s wait until they get it right attitude’’.
4. The continuing bashing of Andrew Morton’s CUSUM.21 And yet, George K.
Barr and B. D. Ariba still advocate the SuperQsum where the individual
sentence lengths are replaced by the respective cumulative sum values.22
5. Foster’s continuing battle with Ward E. Y. Elliott and Robert J. Valenza.
6. Irving Rothman’s problems with Philip Furbank and W. R. Bob Owens:
Rothman is for the use of the non-traditional—Furbank and Owens were pro
but are now con.
7. Timothy David Grant’s disagreement with Chaski over style markers.23
8. Graeme Hirst and Ol’ga Feiguina’s problems with Chaski’s techniques: bi-grams
vs. tri-grams.24
9. Argamon’s problems with Burrows’ Delta: especially the assumptions about
independence and randomness.25
10. Peter W. H. Smith and W. Aldridge’s problems with Burrows’ Delta: especially
its reliance on the Euclidean distance measure. They also have problems
with Hoover’s improvements to the Delta. And there is more about the
Delta.26
11. Rudman’s critique of the fatal flaws in the Historia Augusta studies.27
12. Rudman’s riposte of Burrows’ study of the History of Ophelia.28
13. Burrows’ problems with Rudman’s riposte.29
And maybe we can throw Chaski’s Patent Pending into the ‘‘problem’’ pot—in simple
terms, it is a patent on her authorship attribution technique based on markedness in
language.30 The granting of this patent could pose serious problems in our field if it
prompts everyone to try to patent their process. Her patent application passed the first

hurdle and looks like it is on the way to being granted. The Supreme Court’s 2010 ruling on
the technique of hedging energy prices, and a lower court’s ruling, ‘‘that a process cannot
be patented unless it is ‘tied to a particular machine or apparatus’ or ‘it transforms a
particular article into a different state or thing’’’ may squash Chaski’s patent.31
There are two other patents that should concern us: ‘‘Obfuscating Document
Stylometry’’ by Gary Kacmarcik et al. and ‘‘Computer Method and Apparatus for
Determining Content Types of Web Pages’’ by Kosmas Karadimitriou et al.32
Another problem looming on the horizon has to do with the Federalist Papers. I
have pointed out many flaws and listed many flaws pointed out by others in the
seminal work by Frederick Mosteller and David L. Wallace. It looks more and more
like the twelve disputed Federalist papers are actually Hamilton and Madison
collaborations of one sort or another—this is confirmed by traditional and non-
traditional methods. What ramifications is this going to have?33
3. Failures and Shortcomings
I started my 1997 presentation with the statement that, ‘‘Non-traditional authorship
studies have had enough time to pass through any ‘shake-down’ phase and enter one
marked by solid, scientific, and steadily progressing studies. But after over thirty years
and three hundred publications, they have not.’’34 Now, it is over forty-five years and
over fifteen hundred publications and still there is no consensus as to correct
methodology or technique—if anything, the methodology has become even more
diverse.
There are still major failures and shortcomings in the ‘‘science’’ of non-traditional
authorship attribution. The very terminology has become Babelesque. There even is no
agreement as to the name of the discipline. These are some of the names given to the
field: stylistics, stylostatistics, stylometry, stylometrics, authorship identification,
authorship investigation, authorship categorization, authorship recognition, authorship
verification, authorship attribution, and non-traditional authorship attribution.35
There are numerous articles and books published in the past fifteen years that
‘‘define’’ the discipline and survey the field with a critical eye, for example:36
1. Ilker Nadi Bozkurt, Özgür Baghoglu, and Erkan Uyar’s ‘‘Authorship Attribu-
tion’’
2. J. Gani’s ‘‘Literature and Statistics—II’’
31‘‘Supreme Court,’’ 3B.
32Karadimitriou et al.; Kacmarcik et al.
33Smyth; Rudman, ‘‘Authorship of the Federalist Papers;’’ Collins et al.
34Rudman, ‘‘State of Authorship Studies,’’ 351.
35I prefer non-traditional authorship attribution because it gives deference to the long tradition of authorship
attribution done before the use of the computer and sophisticated statistics.

This list is not exhaustive. Not one of them is universally recognized as the
definitive one—they all labour under length or other restrictions. Tuldava’s does
bring a stronger emphasis on Eastern European work than the others.
Most non-traditional authorship studies are still governed by expediency, for
example:
1. the texts are not correct ones but they were available;
2. the controls are not complete but it would have taken too long to obtain the
correct ones;
3. the assumptions of independence and randomness are ignored;
4. ‘‘but . . . [three pairs of words] were so frequent . . . they . . . changed the whole
Stylometric map. By dropping them out, the results became much more
convenient.’’37
The ‘‘umbrella’’ problem remains—many, if not most non-traditional author-
ship practitioners do not understand what constitutes a valid study. There
follows a discussion of some of the problem areas. Keep these in mind and judge

whether they are handled correctly when you read non-traditional attribution
papers.
3.1 Knowledge of the Field (i.e., the Bibliography)
The fact that there have been so many authorship studies is good. The fact that they
have been published by over ninety different journals across many disciplines makes a
complete literature search time-consuming and difficult—which is not good. To make
things even more difficult, add the more than fourteen books, twenty-two chapters in
books, eighty conference papers, ten reports, twenty-four dissertations, nine newspaper
articles, six encyclopedia entries, and the ten on-line self-published papers. And, try as
I might, I am sure my bibliography of over fifteen hundred entries is not exhaustive.
Now, lest we forget, the field is truly international. For example, I have papers
written in Portuguese, Russian, French, Italian, Slovene, Hebrew, German, Korean,
Japanese, and Spanish. How many of us have the ability to judge the value of these
studies! And, as we all know, there are many studies written in English that treat texts
of other languages—ancient and modern. Another problem in searching for articles is
the truly multidisciplinarity of the field. For example, my non-traditional authorship
writings have been referenced in these fields: Statistics, Computer Science, Physics,
Philosophy, Psychology, History, Law, Modern Languages, Economics, Digital
Forensics, Forensic Linguistics, Quantitative Linguistics, Corpus Linguistics, Library
Science, Information Science, Religion (Mormon, Christian, Jewish), Bibliographic
Studies, Classical Languages, Book History, Literary Studies, Philology, Homeland
Security, Music, and Science.
Some of the non-traditional bibliography is well known: for example, work by
Holmes, Hoover, Burrows, Jockers, Argamon, Craig, Vickers, Eider, Juola, and
Koppel. But there are too many valuable and important studies that are not known—
or at least not referenced.
How many of us are aware of the excellent work on the authorship of the written
President Reagan radio speeches done by Edoardo M. Airoldi et al. that was published
in Bayesian Analysis and by Edoardo M. Airoldi, Stephen E. Fienberg and Kiron K. Skinner
in PS: Political Science and Politics?38 Fienberg was a student of Mosteller and intro-
duces some refinements to the statistics of Mosteller and Wallace’s Federalist studies.
The only references to this work that I have seen are in statistics journals and these
discussed the statistical methodology and not the experimental design or the results.
3.2 Theoretical Underpinnings
The primary hypothesis behind non-traditional authorship studies is that every
author has a verifiably unique style. This hypothesis has never been tested, let alone
proven.39

This lack of a proven theory after more than forty-five years and fifteen hundred
publications is one reason why non-traditional studies are not accepted, in the main,
by either the literary or the scientific community. However, each ‘‘successful’’ study
helps construct a theory by building from the bottom up. Ira Z. Rothstein says that:
There are two strategies to making progress towards finding the correct underlying
theory, 1. The so-called ‘‘top-down’’ approach where one postulates a complete
theory. . . . 2. The empirically based ‘‘bottom-up’’ approach where one uses
experimental data to make smaller, incremental steps.40
Joe Raben, in his Busa lecture, said that advances are made by the accumulation of
discrete bits of information. Also, Peter Grzybek writes:
contemporary research involves three different kinds of orientation: first, we have
many bottom-up oriented, partly in the form of ad-hoc solutions for particular
problems, partly in the form of inductive research; aiming at the formulation of
general laws and models; and finally, we have much exploratory work, which may
be called abductive by nature, since it is characterized by constant hypothesis
testing, possibly resulting in a modification of higher-level hypotheses.41
I am confident a ‘‘comprehensive’’ theory will evolve.
3.3 Reproducibility—Verification—Validation
As I have written elsewhere, a very small percentage of non-traditional authorship
studies are reproducible. We must give all of the information necessary, so that
another practitioner can reproduce exactly what we did. We cannot report that we
disambiguated ‘‘some’’ of the words or that we expanded some of the contractions.
To verify the results of a study by testing the same data with different techniques is
important and valuable, but not sufficient—and note that it is ‘‘the exact same data’’.
Cross validation has really come to the fore in non-traditional attribution studies
and has taken over from holdout validation especially with the computer scientists.
Chaski rightly insists that validation be a part of every acceptable Forensic Linguistic
authorship study.
3.4 Experimental Plan
When formulating the experimental design, the practitioners must make sure they are
testing for authorship and not some other variable such as genre or gender. The
practitioner must eliminate as many of the other variables as possible—variables such
as genre, gender, chronological stylistic shifts, non-authorial (type two) style markers
(e.g., quotations, footnotes), size of texts, editorial interventions, plagiarism,

collaboration, pastiche, mental state, lemmatization, and conflation, and they must
report systematic errors for those that cannot be eliminated.
Michael Brennan and Rachel Greenstadt have shown that writers not even trained
in a broad background of non-traditional attribution studies can mimic the style of
other authors to the point that the imitation can confuse the attribution results to the
extent that they select the correct author at a rate no better than chance.42
James Pennebaker and others point out problems with the use of function words.
Cindy Chung and James Pennebaker show that function word use is a ‘‘function’’ of
the emotional state of the author.43 James Pennebaker, Kate G. Niederhoffer, and
Matthias R. Mehl state, ‘‘Particles [parts of speech that include pronouns, articles,
prepositions, conjunctions, and auxiliary verbs] which serve as the glue that holds
nouns and regular verbs together, can serve as markers of emotional state, social
identity [e.g., age, sex], and cognitive styles.’’44
3.5 The Primary Data
This is a major problem that is almost universally side-stepped. Our primary data are
the texts we use. We must do the following:
a) Select the correct texts. We must get as close to the author’s final holograph as
possible. We cannot blindly use texts from the web—Project Gutenberg and
Google books are full of errors, even the expensive commercial sites have errors
that potentially skew experimental results. Practitioners have even used critical
editions.
b) Unedit the texts. This means removing everything that has been added to the
author’s manuscript by editors, printers, or other like commentators.
c) De-edit the texts. The practitioner must remove any and all extraneous text (e.g.,
quotes, foreign language) that would interfere with a valid non-traditional study.
d) Edit the texts. In this context, any encoding, regularizing, or lemmatizing.
Different types of texts and texts from different eras are handled in different ways.45
3.6 Style Markers (e.g., Function Words, N-Grams)
In 1997, I reported an inventory of over one thousand style markers.46 With
Suguru Ishizaki and David Kaufer’s Docuscope inventory of over forty-one million
language strings,47 and other additions, the total number of style markers has become

moot—approaching infinity, which Richard Forsyth and others claim. There is no one set
of style markers that is correct for every study. If authors have a verifiably unique style, it
stands to reason that in most cases this will be evidenced by a set of different style markers.
3.7 Control Groups
The definitions and types of experimental controls vary from discipline to discipline
and even among experiments within a discipline. An inclusive definition of ‘‘control’’
is as follows: any experimental or statistical technique that is used to insure the
validity of an experiment by testing or verifying data or experimental apparatus.
Controls are used to check the validity of the results. Over the years, the bulk of the
literature on non-traditional attribution studies has constrained the definition of
control into a much narrower sense—that of ‘‘comparison group’’.48
Many practitioners do give ‘‘lip service’’ to the concept and use of controls: never
explicating their selection, use, or value; never using all of the controls. This must
change. And with machine learning we must come to grips with ‘‘training sets’’ and,
as mentioned earlier, ‘‘cross validation’’.
3.8 Statistics
Cherry-picking statistical techniques, ignoring the assumptions behind statistical
tests, and using tests designed for fields not only outside of stylistics but also outside
of Linguistics are the major problems under this heading. For a complete discussion
of these problems see the references in this footnote.49
too many people trying to do ‘‘something new’’ . . . too few doing the dull and
unrewarded tasks of replication and operational refinement that are necessary to a
mature discipline.50
Another troubling trend to note is that the main purpose of too many studies (well
into the hundreds) is to present a new, a novel method that always is better or almost
as good as the old one, for example:
. ‘‘improving the stylometric authorship attribution’’;51
. ‘‘Determining Authorship: A New Technique’’;52
. ‘‘In this paper we present a novel improvement. . .’’;53
. ‘‘[this] served as a pilot effort to apply our new-optics stylometric methods’’.54

What is disturbing about this is that most practitioners are not yet using established
techniques and methodologies to solve real world problems. They are not verifying,
not replicating studies.55 With all of the innovating and improving, will we ever reach
a valid and accepted method?
4. Conclusion
A ‘‘No’’ uttered from the deepest conviction is better than a ‘‘Yes’’ merely uttered
to please, or worse, to avoid trouble. (Mahatma Ghandi)56
I would like to emphasize the duty of every non-traditional authorship attribution
practitioner to be a conscientious gatekeeper. The Gandhi quote illustrates our duty
to be frank and honest when refereeing. It is also the duty of practitioners to respond
to what they perceive to be errors or shortcomings in non-traditional studies—
published or promulgated orally at conferences. For example:
1) Hoover and Argamon both did a good job in their modification and clarification
of Burrows’ Delta.
2) With the ‘‘Daubert Triangle’’ the United States courts have taken on the roll of
gatekeepers with the three rulings that set the standards for the admissibility of
non-traditional evidence and the admission of non-traditional attribution
practitioners as expert witnesses. The two panels from the National Conference
on Science and the Law: (1) ‘‘Admissibility: The Judge as Gatekeeper’’ and (2)
‘‘Junk Science’’ do a very good job of explicating how the legal profession acts as
gatekeeper for non-traditional authorship attribution.
3) My 1998 caution that attribution studies in the Historia Augusta are an exercise
in futility seems to have worked. I have been unable to find any subsequent,
published non-traditional studies of the Historia Augusta.57 The classics
community (at least the comments I have seen) seems to agree with me.
However, past studies do continue to be cited. Tweedie cites some of these
studies as exemplary.58
4) My riposte of Burrows’ paper on the ‘‘History of Ophelia’’ pointed out some
flaws in his experimental methodology.59 Hopefully, when the dust settles, he
will agree.
5) Should we oppose patents such as Chaski’s? I do not know. Chaski has allowed
non-forensic attribution researchers free access.60
55For example, none of the over ninety non-traditional studies of the Federalist papers that came after Frederick
Mosteller and David L. Wallace tried to reproduce their study.
56Mahatma Ghandi quoted in Chaski, ‘‘Author Identification,’’ 1.
57Rudman, ‘‘Historia Augusta.’’
58Tweedie.

Exposing the problems in non-traditional authorship attribution studies goes a
long way in solving them. In closing I would like to paraphrase my favourite quote
from Sir Ronald Syme: The studies should not continue to be dogged and bogged by
retardatory scholarship.61
