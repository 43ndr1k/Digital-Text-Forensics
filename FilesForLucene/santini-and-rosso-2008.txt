In this paper we would like to contribute to the discussion about genre-enabled applications, currently 
engaging many genre researchers, by presenting a preliminary assessment of a web add-on devised to 
augment the result list of general-purpose search engines with genre labels. For this assessment, we 
use a small collection of web pages manually annotated with genre labels by a large number of web 
users. This resource is made up of two sets of web pages created by two independent researchers for 
their own user-based genre studies. This comparison allows us to provide a preliminary view on the 
genre add-on performance and to highlight some open issues in genre research.

1. INTRODUCTION 
Genre is a deeply rooted concept in our civilization. Aristotle’s Poetics started a long-standing discussion about 
literary text classification by identifying the underlying conventions that differentiate epic, lyric and drama, and the 
patterns of form and content that characterize tragedy and comedy. Since then, along the centuries, the interest in 
the conventions typifying textual production has moved from literary criticism, to modern genre analysis, to library 
science, to online bookshops (e.g. see the Browse Genres link in Amazon1, Figure 1) and finally to digital genres, 
and genres on the web, a.k.a. web genres. Regardless this uninterrupted tradition of genre studies and practice, 
the answer to the core question – what is genre? – remains basically open due to the number of dissenting 
definitions, differing characterizations and multiple uses.

In this paper, we focus our attention on the genres that can be found on the web and in other digital environments, 
such as ESHOPS, HOME PAGES, FAQS, ONLINE FORMS, ONLINE TUTORIALS and LIST OF LINKS. The 
theoretical and empirical studies of digital and web genres are developed within different but related disciplines, 
such as genre analysis (e.g. Herring et al., 2005; Askehave and Nielsen, 2005), document management (e.g. 
Orlikowski and Yates, 1994); text technology (e.g. Rehm, 2008), corpus linguistics (e.g. Sharoff, 2007), information 
retrieval (e.g. Muresan et al., 2006), social network analysis (e.g. Paolillo et al., 2007), web mining (e.g. Mehler and 
Wegner, 2008), information extraction (e.g. Gupta et al., 2006), automatic summarization (e.g. Seki, 2005), and 
authorship attribution (e.g. Karlgren and Ericsson, 2007). All the researchers working with genres in these different 
areas strongly believe that genre is an important classification principle that could help many real-world 
applications, since genres could be used as filters, as metadata, for indexing, and in any kind of crawlers, agents, 
or robots that explore or harvest the web or large document collections. Despite its inherent elusiveness, currently 
there is a high peak of interest in the concept of genre. Many recent academic initiatives have been set up to foster 
discussion about this concept2, because – although controversial and difficult to pin down satisfactorily and 
unanimously – the concept of genre has been proved to be useful to overcome information overload and increase 
search relevance and usefulness (Freund, 2008a; Freund, 2008b).

Genre can be considered a non-topical descriptor that, together with other non-topical descriptors like style or 
sentiment, may help formulate or refine the information needs expressed in a query. The specificity of genre with 
respect of other topical and non-topical descriptors lies in its capacity to convey how information is packaged. For 
instance the INTERVIEW genre indicates that a document contains a dialogue between (usually) two people, one 
asking questions, the other providing answers.  
Genres are based on more or less tight conventions. The identification of these conventions allows people to 
reconstruct the context in which texts have been produced, together with their purpose and function. In a word, 
genre is a contextual factor that can be derived from the documents themselves rather than from external human-
computer interactions, like clickthroughs or eye tracking. There would be no problem in retrieving genres if all the 
documents were annotated with genre labels, or contained genre labels in the title, headings and in the meta-
content, or if they could be unambiguously correlated with a limited set of topics. If this was the case, genre labels 
could be simply treated as “terms”, and genres could be unfailingly retrieved by current retrieval models. 
Unfortunately, the scenario is more complex, especially on the web, where genre colonization and genre 
contamination seem to be widespread, since the web is the crossroads of many communities. At present, there are 
still many documents or web pages that belong to a certain genre, and could be relevant and useful for a search 
need, but they do not explicitly contain the name of the genre, or their topics are not predictably correlated with 
predefined genres. Although general-purpose search engines do a good job when the genre of a document is 
mentioned in the document itself or in the meta-content, there are still problems when this does not occur, since 
genre labels can hardly be derived by synonym expansion. This is why the Automatic Genre Identification (AGI) is 
not entirely term-based or topic-dependent. For instance, obvious cues that could turn out to be useful in the 
automatic identification of the INTERVIEW genre are: a high frequencies of questions, second person personal 
pronouns, first personal pronouns, verbs like “believe”, “think”, “assume”, or expressions like “in my opinion”, 
without neglecting graphical hints, like the visual differentiation between questions and answers through the use of 
paragraph spacing, and other typographical cues such as the use of bold.  
Concrete attempts to implement genre-sensitive retrieval models have been made recently. More specifically, 
Luanne Freund (2008) has presented X-Site, a search system designed and implemented to “test the practical 
value of making use of task-genre relationships in real-life work environment” (Freund, 2008b: 114). A demo of X-
Site was shown at SIGIR 2007 (Yeung et al., 2007).  
While X-Site has been devised for professionals (namely software engineers) who can exploit the concept of genre 
to rapidly find information that is task-appropriate, situationally-relevant and mission-critical for their job, WEGA (an 
acronym that stands for WEb Genre Analysis3), has been developed at the Bauhaus University Weimar by Prof 
Benno Stein’s team (Stein et al., 2008) for the web and for common web users. WEGA is an add-on that 
superimposes genre labels a few seconds after the result list is returned by a general-purpose search engine, 
namely Mozilla Firefox.  
These recent applications show that genre-enabled systems are feasible and that genre classes can help improve 
productivity in the workplace (in the case of X-Site) and offer additional hints about the nature of the web pages 
listed in the search results. However, the incapacity of defining genre unambiguously has serious repercussions on 
genre classification and genre labelling. In practical terms, issues that genre researchers constantly face are the 
following:  
(i) How can we say that a genre is a genre, and not another textual category like topic, domain, or style? Although valuable 
attempts to define the boundaries between these neighbouring categories were made by Lee (2001) and Stein and Meyer zu 
Eissen (2006), we still do not have any practical criterion that can help us share a common view on these categories. 
(ii) What are the cognitive, semantic or pragmatic criteria that people follow when creating a document of a certain genre, or 
classifying a document by genre? Scholars and researchers suggest different answers to this question, thus creating a 
plethora of genre classes, selected and defined following contrasting criteria and geared towards different aims.  
 
In this paper, we would like to emphasize the importance of using existing resources (whenever possible) for 
comparison and cross-testing, especially in a field like AGI, where there are no established benchmarks and where 
every decision is left to subjectivity, from the selection of genre taxonomies to the creation of genre collections. 
Comparison and cross-testing help establish relations or correlations between different views and approaches, 
thus creating a more fertile ground for future research. 
While X-Site was evaluated by a user study carried out in December 2005 and based on 32 software service 
consultants (Freund, 2008b: 129-157), WEGA has not yet gone through any user evaluation to date, because, 
although publicly available, it is still under development. Leaving the final evaluation to WEGA’s creators, here we 
propose a transversal and preliminary assessment of the WEGA add-on in order to provide some insights along 
the way, i.e. while WEGA is still in a pre-final stage, hoping that these can contribute to WEGA final version and, 
more in general, to the discussion about genre. 
We propose the re-use of a small number of web pages (50) annotated with genre labels by a large number of 
web users. This resource is made up of two sets of web pages created by two independent researchers for their 
own user-based genre studies, more specifically 20 web pages were labelled by 135 people, and 30 web pages 
were validated by 257 people. This collection is unique and the two sets have never been used beyond the studies 
they were devised for. Here we will use this collection to have an idea of the extent to which the genre labels 
returned by WEGA match the judgement of these two samples of web users. This comparison will allow us to 
provide a preliminary view on the genre add-on performance, and to highlight some open issues in genre research.

The paper is organized as follows: Section 2 briefly describes the user studies in which the two sets were created; 
Section 3 presents a comparative analysis; finally Section 4 draws some conclusions and outlines viable future 
directions. 
2. WEB PAGES LABELLED BY GENRE IN USER STUDIES 
Recently, a number of user studies have been carried out in order to understand which genre classes could be 
useful for web applications, and especially for genre-enabled search engines. 
In 2004, Meyer zu Eissen and Stein (2004) carried out a survey through a questionnaire where university students 
were asked to come up with genres that could meet their information needs. The data were analysed and 
researchers worked out eight classes that could cover the genres suggested by the users. These eight genre 
classes have been incorporated in the current implementation of WEGA (see subsection 3.1). 
In 2004, Rosso (2008) carried out a series of studies to identify the genre classes that could improve web 
searches. After the users proposed their own genres, Rosso developed a palette of 18 genres, and validated this 
palette through a user study with 257 participants classifying 55 web pages. 
In 2005, Santini (2008) set up an online study to investigate the level of disagreement in genre labelling. She 
presented 25 web pages to the users (135 participants) and suggested 21 genre labels, plus two additional labels 
(Add a new type and I don’t know) to be used by the participants when they were not satisfied with the suggested 
labels.  
The tangible outcome of Rosso’s and Santini’s studies is represented by two sets of web pages annotated with 
genre labels by a large number of web users. We wish to use this collection of two sets to explore to what extent 
the genre classification performed by WEGA corresponds to human genre labelling. Our empirical study is 
described in the next section. 
3. WEGA’S PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT 
The rationale of our preliminary assessment is to investigate WEGA performance in classifying the retrieved 
documents by genre while it is still under development, since, at this stage, a full evaluation would still be 
premature. This preliminary assessment will also allow us to highlight some problems that currently affect AGI 
research.  
For this small study, we took all the URLs of the web pages annotated by users in Santini’s and Rosso’s studies, 
and specified them in Mozilla Firefox browser with WEGA activated. Figure 2 shows this procedure: the URL was 
typed in the search box (LHS), the results were labelled by genre by WEGA (see coloured flags next to the 
heading of the snippets). When it was not possible to retrieve the URL, a simple query, based on the web page 
headings, was typed in the search box (RHS).

3.1 WEGA 
WEGA performs the classification of search results using eight genre classes for German and English web pages. 
WEGA implementation is described in Stein et al. (2008). The genre classes worked out as described in Meyer zu 
Eissen and Stein (2004), and implemented in the version of WEGA used in this paper are the following: 
 
1. ARTICLES. Documents with long passages of text, such as research articles, reviews, technical reports, or book chapters. 
2. DISCUSSIONS. All pages that provide forums, mailing lists or discussion boards. 
3. DOWNLOADS. Pages on which freeware, shareware, demo versions of programs etc. can be downloaded. 
4. HELPS. All pages that provide assistance, e.g. Q&A or FAQ pages. 
5. LINK LISTS. Documents which consist of link lists for the main part. 
6. PORTRAYAL (NON-PRIV). Web appearances of companies, universities, and other public institutions. I. e., home or entry 
or portal pages, descriptions of organization and mission, annual reports, brochures, contact information, etc. 
7. PORTRAYAL (PRIV). Private self-portrayals, i.e. typical private homepages with informal content. 
8. SHOP. All kinds of pages whose main purpose is product information or sale. 
 
Multi-genre labelling 
The 2nd BCS-IRSG Symposium on Future Directions in Information Access
56
WEGA is provided also with other non-genre classes, such as “non classifiable”, “unsupported language”, “offline”, 
etc. WEGA follows a multi-labelling scheme, i.e. the same web page can receive several genre labels (see 
Figure 2). 
We assessed WEGA classification following the mapping proposed in Table 1 and Table 2, and used an 
assessment scheme similar to the one employed in Freund et al. (2006): 
 
1 = Exact match – when WEGA applies only label(s) assigned by users. 
2 = Good match – when WEGA applies all the labels assigned by users plus more. 
3 = Fair match – when WEGA includes some of the labels assigned by users. 
4 = No match, when WEGA applies no labels assigned by users. 
 
It is worth reminding that WEGA is still under development and a couple of version have already been released to 
date. The assessment reported here is based on the version issued in March 2008. 
3.2 SANTINI’s (2008) web pages 
The aim of Santini’s study was to explore the need of adopting a multi-labelling genre classification scheme when 
devising genre-enabled applications, because many experiments in automatic genre classification still focus on 
only a single label per web page. Her claim was that the single label does not match the view of web users 
because web pages are often multi-functional and composite. Consequently, when users are forced to select only 
a single label, they focus on different things, thus generating a large disagreement in genre labelling. Santini’s aim 
was not to investigate the usefulness of genre for web searches, but to explore the familiarity of web users with 
labels taken from the web pages themselves. She proposed 21 labels and two escape options (Add a new type 
and I don’t know) that the users could use when they were not satisfied with the 21 suggested labels. Labels were 
suggested in order to reduce the fragmentation that is common with spontaneous users’ terminology (e.g. see the 
range of variants reported in footnotes 4-14). Her assumption was the following: if users can find an appropriate 
label in the proposed list, they would gladly use it because this reduces both their cognitive effort and the number 
of disparate labels (for more details on the sample of participants and the selection of web pages, see Santini, 
2008). The labels suggested in Santini’s study are as follows: 
 
1.  about page 
2.  blog (weblog)  
3.  clog  (community log) 
4.  eshop (online store) 
5.  email message 
6.  ezine 
7.  FAQs 
8.  home page (academic) 
9.  home page (corporate) 
10. home page (organizational) 
11. home page (personal) 
12. hotlist 
13. howto 
14. net advertising (banner) 
15. newsletter 
16. online frontpage 
17. online form 
18. online tutorial 
19. search page 
20. sitemap 
21. splash screen 
22. Add a new type 
23. I don’t know 
 
In Santini’s study, 135 web users labelled 25 web pages using these labels or their own labels (using the Add a 
new type option), or saying I don’t know. Since WEGA palette is coarser-grained than Santini’s labels, we mapped 
Santini’s labels to WEGA labels following the scheme shown in Table 1. The only direct match was shop-eshop.

shows that out of the 20 web pages that could be reached by Mozilla Firefox, there were: Exact Matches=0; Good 
Matches=1; Fair Matches=8; No Match=11.

3.3 ROSSO’S (2008) web pages 
The genre palette developed by Rosso was the result of three user studies. The first study asked experimental 
participants to group a set of web pages by genre and assign names and definitions to each genre. In the second 
study, another set of participants labelled the same set of web pages but their choices were mostly constrained to 
the 48 labels collected during the first study. Participants were allowed to suggest new labels if none of the other 
labels were deemed adequate. Rosso used the results of the two studies to create a palette of 18 genres and 
definitions, derived mostly from user-terminology and preferences. The 18 labels are shown below. A third study 
with new pages and participants “validated” the palette, achieving over an average of over 70% agreement by the 
257 participants for the set of 55 pages (for more details on the sample of participants and the selection of web 
pages, see Rosso, 2008). The labels suggested in Rosso’s study are as follows: 
  
1.  article  
2.  course description 
3.  course list 
4.  diary, weblog or blog 
5.  FAQ/help 
6.  form 
7.  forum/interactive discussion 
8.   index/table of contents/links 
9.   job listing 
10. other instructional materials 
11. personal website 
12. picture/photo 
13. poetry 
14. product for sale/shopping 
15. search start 
16. speech 
17. welcome/homepage 
18. NONE OF THE ABOVE 
 
Table 2 shows how we expected the web page labels assigned by Rosso’s study participants to match up against 
the labels assigned by the WEGA classifier.

Only 30 of Rosso’s 55 original pages were able to be classified by the WEGA add-on. This was mostly due to 
pages that no longer exist, or pages that still exist but are no longer in Google’s index. We used the same match 
criteria as with Santini’s pages, and the results are reported in Table 4 (see Appendix). Out of the 30 web pages 
that could be reached by Mozilla Firefox, there were: Exact Matches=2; Good Matches=0; Fair Matches=11; No 
Match=17. 
3.5 DISCUSSION 
Although the user studies were performed between 2004 and 2005 and WEGA web pages were retrieved in March 
2008, these web pages had often the same layout and similar content. As already noted by Boese and Howe 
(2005), “pages in some genres change rarely if at all and can be used in present-day research experiments without 
requiring an updated version”.  
Looking at the matches with the two sets of pages combined (i.e. 50 web pages all in all), there were: Exact 
Matches= 4%; Good Matches=2%; Fair Matches=38%; No Match=56% (see Figure 2 for a charted overview of 
raw counts).

The sum of Exact Matches, Good Matches and Fair Matches is about 45%, which is a promising achievement 
since genre classification in an open environment like the web is overly difficult for a number of reasons. One 
reason concerns the distribution of genres on the web. As we do not know how genres are distributed on the web, 
it is very difficult to approximate web genre population in any computational and statistical model. Another reason 
is related to feature representativeness, because the relationship between automatically extractable features and 
web genres is still under exploration. To date, a number of experiments have been carried out to investigate the 
efficiency and effectiveness of a range of genre features, but always on very small genre collections, containing 
only a restricted number of genres and a limited number of documents (e.g. cf. Dong et al., 2008; Kim and Ross, 
2008; Kanaris and Stamatatos, 2007). In particular, WEGA has been trained and tested on two small but widely 
used genre corpora, the KI-04 corpus (Meyer zu Eissen and Stein, 2004) and the 7-web-genre collection (Santini, 
2007), both containing fewer than 2000 web pages. 
An important factor that causes bias in our comparison is the misalignment of Santini’s and Rosso’s palettes with 
WEGA palette. Both Santini’s and Rosso’s palettes contain genres that had no obvious correspondence with 
WEGA palette. Clearly, WEGA palette is generally at a higher level of abstraction than the other two palettes. In 
this respect, it would be very helpful for future research to start creating a network of relationships between genres. 
For example, a new resource could be designed and implemented similar to the hierarchical framework adopted in 
Wordnet, or following an ontology-like structure. This would permit not only more straightforward comparisons 
among different genre palettes and different collections, but also a deeper understanding of the cognitive criteria or 
constraints underlying genre classes.  
As far as WEGA is concerned, it seems to be a good idea, for search or browsing purposes, to have more coarse-
grained genre classes like HELP including FAQS, TUTORIALS and HOWTOS, or a LINKLIST genre including 
different kind of listing genres, like SITEMAPS and HOTLISTS. Therefore, a certain level of abstraction in the 
genre classes presented to web users is very welcomed. However, it is not clear how to distribute more fine-
grained genres like BLOGS (usually divided into several subclasses, like PERSONAL BLOGS or NEWS BLOGS, 
characterised by different purposes and audience) within more general classes. Maybe, BLOGS should have their 
own place in any genre palette. While BLOGS have a very strong genre identity, classes like PORTRAYAL 
PRIVATE and PORTRAYAL NON-PRIVATE seem to be rather opaque. For this reason, they have been replaced 
by other labels, namely PERSONAL HOMEPAGE and NON-PERSONAL HOME PAGE respectively, in the version 
of WEGA released in April 2008. 
Given the small size of the user-labelled web page collection, we cannot draw any final conclusions. As mentioned 
earlier, a full evaluation (maybe task-based) will probably be carried out by WEGA’s creators when this application 
reaches its completion. With this preliminary assessment, we would like to emphasise that there is still a lot to 
know about the tradeoffs involved in genre labelling, the variations across different genres, and the cognitive 
implications in the use of genres (see also Freund et al., 2006).   
4. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS 
In this paper, we presented a preliminary assessment of WEGA, a genre add-on. Since no genre test collections or 
genre benchmarks are currently available, we assessed WEGA performance using 50 web pages annotated with 
genre labels by the participants to two genre studies. On this small collection, WEGA performance in March 2008 
was below 50%. Apparently, there is a wide gap between laboratory tests of genre classifiers and the performance 
in real-world conditions. Recorded performance measurements for automatic genre classifiers can be higher than 
90% (cf. Santini, 2007; Kanaris and Stamatatos, 2007; Dong et al., 2008). If web retrieval by genre is ever to 
become a widespread reality, this gap must be filled by future research. 
Obviously, a reliable and convincing evaluation cannot be based only on a collection of 50 web pages. We 
consider the assessment described in this paper only a first step towards a larger evaluation. Nonetheless, it is 
important to stress that this collection, although tiny, is unique because it is labelled by a large number of web 
users. It is also worth noting that existing genre collections are all annotated with disparate genre criteria, and the 
annotation is commonly decided on the agreement of a very small number of annotators (at most 4), or decided by 
the individual researchers themselves. This high degree of subjectivity leads also to diversified genre palettes, and 
their mapping introduces a bias in subsequent re-use. We suggest that the creation of a genre resource capable of 
spelling out and encoding the inter-relationships among genres would be useful and would permit a more effective 
re-utilization of existing resources.  
From a methodological viewpoint, WEGA is a web browser add-on. Therefore the retrieval of relevant documents 
is decided by the underlying search engine on the basis of topical keywords, and WEGA applies genre labels on 
the search results. A viable and complementary line of genre research would be the integration of topic and genre 
as combined search criteria, as in Vidulin et al., 2007.
