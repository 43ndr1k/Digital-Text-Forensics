1. Introduction
Author	 identification	 is	 a	 task	commonly	performed	 in	historical	 research,	 archeology	
and	criminology.	Historically	it	was	predominantly	considered	in	the	context	of	handwritten	
text	i.e.	taking	into	account	author’s	writing	style.	Nowadays,	as	most	of	documents	are	being	
stored	in	their	electronic	versions,	it	is	impossible	to	complete	the	identification	procedure	
employing	 solely	 graphical	 features	 of	 the	 text.	Moreover,	 novel	 types	 of	 textual	 content	
like	computer	programming	source	code,	pose	new	problems,	by	excluding	the	possibility	
of	using	graphical	text	representation	in	the	framework	of	automatic	authorship	attribution.	
The	task	of	selecting	author	of	a	given	text	from	a	known	list	of	authors	can	be	perceived	as	
a	classification	or	pattern	recognition	problem.	It	is	a	commonly	known	issue	in	data	mining	
[23],	with	a	broad	range	of	areas	where	it	transpires,	e.g.	biometrics,	medical	diagnostics	or	
intrusion	detection	systems	 [6,	14].	Classification	 is	a	 task	of	assigning	elements	 from	so	
called	testing	set,	denoted	by	matrix	Y: 
 Y Y Y Yn= [ ]1 2 ... 	 (1)
which	n	columns	represent	features	of	mtest	objects	belonging	to	this	dataset,	to	one	of	the	
known	C classes.	Usually	a	set	of	representative	elements	for	those	classes	is	additionally	
given,	in	the	form	of	a	training	dataset:	
 X X X X n= [ ]1 2 ... 	 (2)
with	mtrain	elements	having	class	labels	explicitly	defined.	The	task	for	a	classifier	is	to	learn	
how	to	predict	class	assignment	for	testing	dataset	using	knowledge	acquired	from	training	
set.	In	case	of	the	authors	identification	tasks,	class	label	corresponds	to	author’s	identifier,	
training	set	to	a	set	of	documents	with	known	authors	and	testing	set	to	a	group	of	documents	
which	 authorship	 needs	 to	 be	 identified.	 To	 successfully	 perform	 such	 tasks	 one	 should	
select	capable	classification	algorithm	and,	even	more	importantly,	define	suitable	document	
representation,	in	the	form	of	n	distinctive	features.	
This	paper	investigates	a	possibility	of	employing	various	non-graphical	sets	of	features	
for	 author	 identification	 task.	Among	 others	we	 take	 into	 account	 presence	 of	 distinctive	
grammatical	structures,	quantitative	analysis	of	parts	of	speech,	and	diversity	of	words	or	
punctuation.	 It	 is	 usability	 of	 aforementioned	 features	 that	 is	 experimentally	 assessed	 for	
selected	authors	identification	task.	
There	exists	a	vast	amount	of	studies	in	the	area	of	this	contribution,	however	usually	not- 
-involving	such	a	broad	range	of	characteristics	being	examined	at	the	same	time.	Previous	
work	in	this	area	involve	using:	lexical	features	(e.g.	functional	words),	character	features,	
including	 alphabetic	 or	 digit	 characters	 count,	 uppercase	 and	 lowercase	 characters,	 letter	
frequencies,	etc.	[5],	syntactic	features	[11],	semantic	features	[1]	and	application	specific	
characteristics,	 like	 the	 use	 of	 greetings,	 signatures,	 etc.	 [24].	 The	 problem	 of	 language	
specific	issues	 is	also	widely	studied	[4].	 Interesting	applications	of	authorship	attribution	
include	microblogging	posts	author	identification	[15],	gender	recognition	[3]	or	combining	
author	 classification	 with	 opinion	mining	 [18].	Accomplished	 surveys	 of	 techniques	 and	
strategies	commonly	employed	for	authorship	attribution	tasks	can	be	found	in	[9,	13,	22].

The	 paper	 is	 organized	 as	 follows.	 First,	 we	 give	 a	 detailed	 description	 of	 documents	
characteristics,	 useful	 for	 their	 representation	 in	 authorship	 attribution	 task.	 It	 is	 followed	 by	
experimental	setup,	employed	to	assess	the	efficiency	of	classification	algorithm	used	with	various	
documents	features	sets.	Finally,	the	discussion	and	proposals	for	further	research	are	given.
2. Document content representation
Document	content	will	be	described	here	by	five	groups	of	features	corresponding	to	the	
following	characteristics	of	a	text,	given	in	its	computer-written	representation:	
a)	 document	 grammatical	 composition,	 represented	 by	 features’	 group	GR,	 composed	 of	 
R	+	9	characteristics	g1,	g2,	...,	gR+9	with	R	being	a	parameter	related	to	the	size	of	analyzed	
set	of	grammatical	structures;
b)	 used	punctuation	marks,	represented	by	features	group	P	which	includes	16	characteristics	
p1,	p2,	...,	p16;
c)	 words	length,	given	by	features	group	L : l1,	l2,	...,	l4;
d)	 document	formatting	defined	by	features	group	F : f1,	f2,	...,	f5;
e)	 words	usage	described	by	features	group	V : v1,	v2,	...,	v9.
The	same	set	of	features	can	be	used	to	characterize	numerous	documents	–	belonging	to	
both,	training	and	testing	datasets.	Albeit,	a	document	D	description	might	be	for	example	
given	by	D = {GR,	V}	–	it	would	mean	that	it	is	characterized	only	by	indicators	related	to	
grammatical	composition	and	used	words	statistics.	The	study	of	applicability	of	different	set	
of	features	for	author’s	identification	task	will	be	conducted	in	the	next	Section	of	the	paper.	
We	will	now	provide	a	description	of	features	which	were	assigned	to	groups	listed	above.	
2.1.	Document	grammatical	composition
Grammar	is	a	linguistic	concept	concerning	both	the	shape	of	words	and	how	words	(and	
phrases)	can	be	combined	[2].	Grammar,	in	essence,	consists	of	two	components:	morphology,	
i.e.	study	of	how	words	are	formed	out	of	smaller	units	(morphemes)	and	the	syntax,	which	is	
a	system	of	rules	specifying	how	lexical	items	ought	to	be	composed	together	[21].	Of	those	
two,	when	considering	writing	style	analysis,	the	syntax	is	of	more	importance.	
To	analyze	syntactic	structure	of	sentences	one	should	define	a	notation	to	conveniently	
represent	content	of	a	given	text.	Tree	structure	is	commonly	used	for	that	purpose.	Its	branch	
nodes	 represent	 non-terminal	 syntactic	 symbols	 (with	 sentence	 as	 a	 root)	 and	 leaves	 are	
equivalent	 to	 lexical	 tokens	of	 the	sentence.	To	obtain	structure	 in	 this	form	text	needs	 to	
be	parsed.	This	 language-dependent	 task	is	one	of	 the	most	 important	 in	natural	 language	
processing.	Here,	we	assume	that	analyzed	text	corpus	is	parsed	with	popular	Stanford	parser	
[12].	
To	identify	a	presence	of	selected	tree	components,	we	established	256	most	commonly	
used	syntactic	structures	in	English,	extracted	from	the	Wall	Street	Journal	corpora	contained	
by	Penn	Treebank	project	[19].	It	can	be	found	on	the	website	[16].	On	that	basis,	a	feature	set:
 g g gR1 2, , , 	 (3)
6
was	created.	Each	characteristic	from	this	set	indicates	how	many	times	top	R	structures	from	
the	ranking	were	used	in	the	analyzed	document.	For	example	g1	corresponds	to	the	number	
of	“preposition	+	noun	phrase”	structures	found	in	the	text.	In	general,	for	ranking	size	R	one	
can	assume	any	value	between	1	and	256.
Set	 of	 features	mentioned	 above	 corresponds	 to	 the	 presence	 of	 selected	 grammatical	
constructs	 in	 analyzed	 document.	Next	 attribute	gR+1	 describes	 concentration	 of	 syntactic	
elements	 listed	 in	 the	 ranking.	 Let	 N gR ii
R=
=∑ 1 	 denote	 occurrence	 of	 constructs	 from	
the	selected	set	of	R	grammatical	structures	in	the	given	text	and	let	NG	to	indicate	overall	
number	 of	 structures	 pointed	 out	 by	 syntactic	 parser	 for	 the	 analyzed	 document.	 Then	 
gR+1	can	be	written	as:	
 g
N
NR
R
G
+ =1 	 (4)
Subsequent	attributes	gR+2,	gR+3,	...,	gR+9	describe	the	occurrence	of	the	individual	parts	of	speech	
in	the	text.	Here	gR+2	corresponds	to	the	incidence	of	nouns, gR+3 –	pronouns,	gR+4 –	adjectives,	gR+5	
–	verbs,	gR+6	–	adverbs,	gR+7	–	prepositions,	gR+8	–	conjunctions	and	gR+9	–	interjections.
2.2.	Document	punctuation
Punctuation	 is	 a	 practice	 of	 inserting	 standardized	 signs	 to	 clarify	 the	meaning	 and	
separate	language	structural	units	[20].	Among	fourteen	most	commonly	used	punctuation	
marks	 in	 English,	 at	 parsing	 stage	 the	 following	 symbols	 are	 identified	 here:	 full	 stop,	
exclamation	 mark,	 question	 mark,	 comma,	 semicolon,	 colon,	 apostrophe,	 quotation	
mark,	 ellipsis,	 dash,	 hyphen,	 slash	 plus	 additionally	 multiple	 exclamation	 marks	 and	
multiple	question	marks.	Use	of	those	signs	is	indicated	by	features	group	P	formed	of	16	
characteristics.
The	first	attribute	p1,	denoted	by:	
 p
N
N
P
C
1 = 	 (5)
represents	number	of	punctuation	marks	Np	listed	above	found	in	the	text,	divided	by	total	
number	of	characters	Nc.	
Second	feature	from	this	set	p2	describes	variety	of	punctuation	marks,	by	employing	the	
following	formula:	
 p NP2 =
* 	 (6)
where	 NP
* 	symbolizes	overall	number	of	different	punctuation	signs	found	in	the	analyzed	
document.	
Finally,	 features	p3,	p4,	 ...,	p16	 refer	 to	 the	number	of	 times	each	of	punctuation	marks	
listed	above	was	used	in	the	text,	scaled	by	total	number	of	punctuation	marks	Np.

2.3.	Document	word	length	statistics
Features	group	L	aims	at	capturing	authors’	tendency	to	use	short	words,	long	words	or	
in	general	–	words	of	approximately	similar	length.	Let	us	denote	by	S	a	set	of	all	sentences	
in	the	text,	and	by	Ws	a	set	of	all	words	forming	a	given	sentence	s ∈ S.	Consequently,	by	
size(w)	where	w ∈ Ws	we	understand	length	of	a	selected	word	w	while	using	card(S)	and	
card(Ws)	at	the	same	time	to	represent	cardinalities	of	both	sets	defined	above.	
First	feature	l1	introduced	here	is	referring	to	the	average	word	length	in	the	sentences	
forming	the	text,	and	can	be	written	as:

Two	other	features	from	this	group	refer	to	the	number	of	short	words	(consisting	of	less	
than	4	characters)	and	long	words	(made	up	of	more	than	6	characters).	Both	attributes	are	
relative	to	the	sum	of	words	used	in	the	text,	and	can	be	written	as	follows:

2.4.	Document	formatting
Formatted	 text,	 as	 opposed	 to	 plain	 text,	 introduces	 additional	 styling	 information.	 In	
general	it	can	include	colors,	font,	characters	size	or	other	special	elements	e.g.	hyperlinks.	
8
However,	most	of	text	repositories	comprise	only	carriage	returns	or	additional	soft	returns.	
The	following	set	of	features	captures	writers’	individual	preferences	to	use	those	formatting	
elements	in	their	documents.	
The	 first	 feature	 f1	 considered	 here,	 refers	 directly	 to	 the	 number	 of	 paragraphs,	 i.e.	
sections	of	the	text	with	first	line	being	indented.	Next	attribute	f2	captures	average	number	
of	sentences	included	in	one	paragraph,	which	can	be	written	as:	
 f S
N2
=
card
par
( ) 	 (11)
with	Npar	representing	total	number	of	paragraphs	in	the	analyzed	document.	
Features	 f3	and	 f4	characterize	average	number	of	words	and	characters	per	paragraph.	
They	can	be	written	as	follows:	
 f

3 =

and

Finally,	last	feature	from	this	group,	f5	describes	writer’s	tendency	to	format	the	text	with	
empty	lines.	It	is	represented	by	relative	number	of	blank	lines:	
 f
N
N
L
E
L
5 = 	 (14)
with	NL
E	being	total	amount	of	empty	lines	in	the	text	and	NL	–	all	lines	in	the	analyzed	document.	
2.5.	Words	use	statistics
Authors	 usually	 differ	 in	 the	 sizes	 and	 structures	 of	 their	 vocabularies.	Therefore	 the	
analysis	 of	 vocabulary	 richness	 and	 its	 concentration	 could	 be	 useful	 in	 the	 context	 of	
authorship	attribution	[7].	Feature	set	V	being	introduced	here	aims	to	quantitatively	express	
those	characteristics.
First	feature	under	consideration	v1	refers	directly	to	the	number	of	distinct	words	used	
in	the	text	Nv.	Five	features	which	follow,	employ	the	concept	of	hapax legomenon	(gr.	said	
once)	that	is	words	that	only	occur	once	in	the	text	[10]	and	dis legomenon	–	words	appearing	
twice.	 Let	 us	 denote	 by	Nhl,	Ndl	 number	 of	hapaxes	 found	 in	 the	 document.	 First	 five	 of	
aforementioned	features	are	now	defined	as	follows:

Defining	additional	text	characteristics	–	Nil	representing	number	of	words	occurring	in	
the	text	precisely	i-times,	allows	us	to	formulate	three	last	features	in	this	set,	recognized	as

3. Experimental studies
Experiments	performed	were	designed	to	evaluate	usefulness	of	features	sets	listed	above	
for	authorship	attribution	tasks	and	to	study	performance	of	classifiers	employing	carefully	
selected	groups	of	attributes.	
Experimental	studies	were	conducted	using	Thomson	Reuters	Text	Research	Collection	
(known	 as	 TRC2	 dataset).	 The	 dataset	 includes	 almost	 2	 million	 news	 reports	 collected	
between	January	2008	and	February	2009.	We	have	chosen	randomly	documents	authored	
10
by	 20	 writers	 (around	 100	 contributions	 each).	 The	 first	 part	 consisting	 of	 10	 writers	
contributions	was	used	for	first	part	of	experiments	–	involving	feature	set	evaluation,	and	
will	be	referred	to	as	the	training	dataset.	The	rest	of	experimental	data	(labeled	as	the	testing	
dataset)	was	employed	in	the	second	part	of	numerical	studies,	more	thoroughly	investigating	
the	performance	of	selected	classification	algorithms.
As	 classifiers	 Naïve	 Bayes,	 feed-forward	 Neural	 Network	 with	 back-propagation	
learning,	classic	k-Nearest	Neighbor	(with	k	=	3)	and	Random	Forests	were	chosen,	with	the	
latter	two	only	being	employed	in	the	last	part	of	this	study.	Optimal	values	of	parameters	for	
investigated	techniques	were	determined	through	a	set	of	pilot	runs.	For	more	details	on	those	
algorithms	one	could	refer	to	[6].	
3.1.	Feature	set	selection
First	 we	 examined	 usability	 of	 features	 listed	 in	 the	 previous	 Section	 for	 authorship	
attribution.	For	that	purpose	Sequential	Forward	Search	(SFS)	or	Sequential	Backward	Search	
(SBS)	algorithm	were	executed,	with	k-nearest	neighbor	classifier	being	used	for	evaluation.	
Both	techniques	constitute	similar	supervised	feature	selection	paradigms	[17].	First	algorithm	
starts	with	empty	candidate	feature	subset	and	at	each	iteration	adds	the	feature	which	maximizes	
classifier	accuracy.	SBS	is	the	opposite	strategy	–	it	starts	with	the	entire	set	of	available	features,	
and	 then	 iteratively	removes	one	feature	at	 the	 time,	as	 long	as	aforementioned	measure	of	
accuracy	 improves,	where	 the	 feature	 removed	maximizes	 this	 improvement	 [8].	Here,	 the	
discriminative	power	of	a	given	feature	set	was	determined	through	cross-validation.	
Feature	selection	algorithms	were	executed	with	R	=	256	and	five	different	schemes:
 – Basic	 Feature	 Selection	 (BFS)	 –	 feature	 selection	 is	 performed	 on	 all	 groups	 of	
characteristics	listed	in	Section	2.
 – Two	Phase	Feature	Selection	(TPFS)	–	feature	selection	algorithm	is	executed	on	non-
grammatical	characteristics	(all	but	GR).	Obtained	reduced	feature	set	is	merged	with	GR 
and	feature	selection	is	performed	again.
 – Parallel	Feature	Selection	(PARFS)	–	feature	selection	is	conducted	in	parallel	on	non-
grammatical	and	grammatical	characteristics,	obtained	reduced	feature	sets	are	merged	
afterwards.	
 – Grammatical	 Feature	 Selection	 (GFS)	 –	 feature	 selection	 is	 conducted	 only	 on	
characteristics	from	the	grammatical	ranking.
 – Non-Grammatical	 Feature	 Selection	 (NGFS)	 –	 feature	 selection	 is	 executed	 only	 on	
characteristics	not	listed	in	grammatical	ranking.
Table	1	illustrates	a	number	of	features	obtained	for	different	variants	of	feature	selection.	
It	is	evidently	observed	that	forward	search	principally	results	in	more	compact	reduced	set	of	
characteristics,	which	is	naturally	caused	by	local	search	nature	of	this	algorithm.	Individual	
characteristics	most	frequently	chosen	in	experiments	involving	different	feature	selection	
strategies,	 for	 both,	 features	 listed	 (top	 ten)	 and	 not	 listed	 (top	 ten)	 in	 the	 grammatical	
ranking	are	shown	on	Fig.	1.	It	can	be	observed	that	most	useful	features	are	found	within	
grammatical	ranking,	especially	between	features	g20	and	g100.	Furthermore	features	describing	
incidence	of	pronouns	(gR+3),	adverbs	(gR+6)	and	prepositions	(gR+7)	appeared	frequently	 in	
the	reduced	feature	sets.	Among	non-grammatical	characteristics	ratio	of	punctuation	marks	
and	occurrence	of	exclamation	mark,	dash	and	hyphen	were	found	particularly	important;	
however	in	general	selection	ratio	for	those	features	seems	to	be	significantly	lower.

3.2.	Performance	analysis
Next	series	of	experiments	was	devoted	to	studying	performance	of	selected	classifiers

It	 can	be	 seen	 that	 employing	a	broad	 range	of	grammatical	 features	 is	 crucial	 for	
obtaining	 high	 classification	 accuracy.	Random	Forests	 classifier	was	 found	 to	 be	 the	
best	performing	one.	Among	various	schemes	of	 feature	selection	 the	most	 successful	
were	Two	Phase	 Feature	 Selection,	Basic	 Feature	 Selection	 and	Grammatical	 Feature	
Selection.
Finally	 selected	 best-performing	 classifiers	 based	 on	 Random	 Forests	 and	 k-Nearest	
Neighbor	were	more	thoroughly	evaluated	for	both	datasets.	We	used	set	of	characteristics	
with	R	=	256 and	Sequential	Backward	Search	along	with	Two	Phase	Feature	Selection	or	
Grammatical	Feature	Selection	(for	k-Nearest	Neighbor).	Results	obtained	for	10	runs	and	
both	training	and	testing	datasets,	with	5-fold	cross-validation	are	shown	on	Fig.	2.

4. Conclusion
This	 contribution	 examined	 the	 possibility	 of	 employing	 various	 characteristics	 of	
documents	 in	 computer-written	 form	 for	 authorship	 attribution.	The	 suitability	 of	 several	
features	was	considered	for	parsed	instances	of	news	reports,	taking	into	account	a	possibility	
of	using	few	discrimination	algorithms	for	conclusive	classification.	It	was	established	here,	
that	 for	 ensuring	 proper	 classifier	 performance	 the	 most	 important	 ones	 are	 those	 based	
on	occurrence	of	grammatical	 structures.	We	also	 identified	 tree-based	classifiers	as	most	
promising	in	terms	of	accuracy	–	for	both	training	and	testing	datasets.	In	general,	authors’	
classification	for	selected	features	and	both	instances	proved	to	be	reasonably	accurate.	It	can	
be	noted	that	presented	approach	can	be	used	for	different	languages	–	provided	that	suitable	
parsing	procedure	could	be	conducted	beforehand.
Further	work	 in	 the	 research	 area	 of	 this	 contribution	will	 involve	 employing	genetic	
feature	 set	 selection.	 Supplementary	 experimental	 studies	 on	 effectiveness	 of	 various	
classifiers	are	planned	as	well.	The	possibility	of	using	authorship	attribution	techniques	for	
identifying	source	code	creator	constitutes	likewise	a	promising	area	of	upcoming	research.
