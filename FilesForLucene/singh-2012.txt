Abstract. There has been intensive research carried out in the field of OCR (Opti-
cal Character Recognition). Lots of work has been done and articles have been 
published. Noise is one of the important factors which have to be handled at the 
stage of preprocessing before applying other steps of OCR systems. Noise is un-
desirable signal because it obscures the subject of the image. This paper presents 
the comparative study of the five noise removal approaches: Weiner, Median, 
Wavelet, Contourlet, and Curvelet for document images. The different approaches 
of noise removal were compared visually and by employing Peak Signal to Noise 
Ratio (PSNR), F-measure and NRM evaluation measures. 
Keywords: OCR, Noise, Curvelet, Wavelet, Contourlet, Weiner filter, Median  
filter. 
1   Introduction 
Noise removal is necessary step during pre-processing of the document images 
before applying  OCR to it. The output of this step is clean or smoothed document 
images which can be used efficently as the input to OCR systems. Noise removal 
is one of the ongoing resarch area in the field of the textual image processing  and 
OCR. The era of OCR research is four decades old. Lots of research work has 
been done and different methodologies has been developed for OCR systems. But 
still noise removal is challenging due to availability of different types of noises in 
real document images.  Real life documents contain many defects such as holes, 
dots and spots due to several reasons which range from the acquisition source type 
to environmental conditions [1]. In the process of digitization of documents, scan-
ner and camera are the important hardware to capture the document image. Noise 
is also found in documents printed on low grade paper, printed by old printers and 
photocopying machines. Restoration of morphological information presented on

the document image is the important step for enhancing performance of OCR sys-
tems while keeping the fine details of the image intact [2].  
Most approaches of document smoothing are based on human noise detection 
and filter selection. This process of smoothing may also be done automatically.  
Filtering approaches cannot be applied blindly because different filters cannot re-
move all type of noise and it leads to inefficiency in filtering process. There may 
be a difficult situation if the type of noise being removed does not exist in the 
document image or does not match with the strength of the filter [3].  
There exist several types of noise models such as Gaussian noise, Rayleigh 
noise, Gamma noise, Exponential noise, Salt and pepper noise, uniform noise, and 
sinusoidal noise [4]. So, it is important to identify noise type and accordingly se-
lect filtering approach. It is really difficult to characterize and classify noise type 
and filter selection automatically. Recognition of noise type, classification and un-
derstanding of filters strength is very important for suitable noise removal, en-
hancing efficiency and quality of document image [5]. But in real document im-
ages, it is very difficult to identify the noise type because the document may 
contain so many types of noises. 
2   Literature Review 
There are two approaches of image filtering to clean noise in document images; 
human classification based and blindly applies a batch of image filters. Few works 
are reported in [6-9] based on classification of the noise available in a document 
image for identifying a filter to use. Most of the works reported are based on the 
human classification in the identification of noise and filter selection. Classifica-
tion of noise may also be based on the properties like shape, gray values, position 
and periodicity of occurrence in the document. Noise types such as ink blobs, 
complex background binarized patterns, marginal noise [10] and salt-n-pepper 
[11- 12] often lack any consistent property. This irregular noise has typically been 
classified with simple rule based features. If behaviour of noise is consistent in 
terms of these properties, it is called regular noise.  
Some other works on noise removal are reported in [13- 21]. In [22-23] noise 
blocks with large size, which are unlikely to be text, are removed using heuristic 
rules. Chinnasarn et al. [24] proposed an algorithm based on activity detection is 
proposed to remove salt and pepper noise from document images that contain 
graphics, characters, and dithered areas. Cheriet [25] proposed a multi-scale ap-
proach to extract the full shape of handwritten data from noisy gray level images, 
in order to overcome the intensity variation of strokes over a broad range of spatial 
scales. The method presented by Don [26] proposed a method based on noise spot 
model with Gaussian spatial distributions and Gaussian gray value distributions. 
Nishiwaki et al. [27] proposed a method of robust frame extraction and take care 
of noisy document.

3   Methods Employed for Noise Removal 
In the off-line OCR, handwritten as well as printed document image to be recog-
nized is captured by a sensor, for example, a scanner or a camera. Pre-processing 
is always a necessity whenever the document to be processed is noisy, inconsistent 
or incomplete. Pre-processing significantly improves the effectiveness of docu-
ment analysis techniques. This paper attempts to presents a comparative study for 
noise removal from the grey document images. We applied the following methods 
on the sample data taken:  
3.1   Median Filter 
Median filter [28] is a well known approach that can remove salt and pepper noise 
from images but it fails in preserving corners and thin lines in a document image. 
A median filter is a non linear spatial filter. 
3.2   Weiner Filter 
Wiener filter [28] is an adaptive filter and often produces better results than linear 
filtering. The adaptive filter is more selective than a comparable linear filter, pre-
serving edges and other high-frequency parts of an image. The wiener filter ex-
ploits the statistical properties of the image and can be used to restore image in the 
presence of blur as well as noise.  
3.3   Contourlet Transform 
The human visual system is so trained that it requires least number of visual active 
cells to capture the essential information of a natural scene. Also the receptive 
fields in the visual cortex are characterized as being localized, oriented and band 
pass [29]. Considering this we can say that the image representation should fulfill 
following conditions: 
 
1. Multi-resolution: The representation should allow images to be successively 
approximated, from coarse to fine resolutions. 
2. Localization: The basis elements in the representation should be localized in 
both the spatial and the frequency domains. 
3. Critical sampling: For some applications (e.g., compression), the representa-
tion should form a basis, or a frame with small redundancy. 
4. Directionality: The representation should contain basis elements oriented at a 
variety of directions, much more than the few directions that are offered by 
separable wavelets. 
5. Anisotropy: To capture smooth contours in images, the representation should 
contain basis elements using a variety of elongated shapes with different as-
pect ratios. 
The first three conditions are fulfilled by separable wavelets, while the last two  
requires a new construction, which gave birth to the concept of contourlet [30].  
850 B. Singh et al.
 
Natural images do not simply consist of smooth scan lines rather they consist of dis-
continuous curves which are located along the smooth contours, hence contourlet. 
Thus, a contourlet is a flexible multi-resolution, local and directional image repre-
sentation using contour segments. The contourlets have elongated supports at vari-
ous scales, directions and aspect ratios [29]. The above properties allow contourlet 
to efficiently represent an image with smooth curves at multiple resolutions.  
3.4   Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) 
The Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is the sampled version of Continuous 
Wavelet Transform (CWT). The Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is based on 
sub-band coding and is found to yield a fast computation of Wavelet Transform. It 
is easy to implement and reduces the computation time and resources required.  
The DWT requires less space utilizing the space-saving coding based on the fact 
that wavelet families are orthogonal or bi-orthogonal bases, and thus do not pro-
duce redundant analysis [31].  In CWT, the signals are analyzed using a set of ba-
sis functions which relate to each other by scaling and translation. In the case of 
DWT, a time-scale representation of the digital signal is obtained using digital fil-
tering techniques.  
3.5   Curvelet Transform 
The Curvelet frame preserves the important properties, such as parabolic scaling, 
tightness and sparse representation for surface-like singularities of co-dimension one.  
Since many of the characters not only consist of edge discontinuities but also of curve 
discontinuities, the most widely used Wavelet transform works well with edge dis-
continuities but a curve discontinuity affects all the Wavelet coefficients . On the oth-
er hand, the curve discontinuities in any character are well handled with Curvelet 
transform with very few numbers of coefficients. Candes and Donoho [32-33] 
showed that curvelets are better than wavelets at representing edges and de-noising. 
4   Evaluation Measures 
The denoising approaches are evalated using three well known measures: PSNR, 
NRM and F-measure. The first evaluation measure,  PSNR (Peak signal-to-noise 
ratio):  the ratio between the maximum possible power of a signal and the power 
of corrupting noise that affects the fidelity of its representation. The second 
measure, F-measure: the weighted harmonic mean of precision and recall. The 
third evaluation measure, NRM (Negative Rate Metric): based on pixel-wise 
mismatches between the ground truth and observations in a frame.  
5   Results and Discussions 
For this experiment, a dataset of 20 handwritten as well as printed English docu-
ments were collected. We collected two types of documents: noise free and noised

scanned documents. In noise free document images, we introduced Gaussian 
noise so that we can compare our results with the noise less images by calculating 
different evaluation approach such as PSNR, NRM, F- measure and determined 
the efficiency or effectiveness of  approaches in context to noise removal. The re-
sults of denoising approaches are shown in fig.1. Fig. 2 shows the performance of 
different approaches of noise removal using PSNR evaluation measure. We have 
also compared denoising techniques on different variance of Gaussian noise based 
on F-measure and NRM evaluation measures as shown in table 1.

6   Conclusions 
Printing, photocopying, and scanning processes degrade the image quality of any 
documents. In this research work, we presented a comparitive study of Weiner, 
Median, Wavelet, Contourlet, and Curvelet denoising techniques based on three 
evaluation measures: PSNR, F-measure, and NRM. On the basis of results, 
Curvelet, Wavelet and Contourlet preserves morphological structre of characters 
but not effective in the denoiseing of document images. This study is useful in the 
designing and development of new denoising algorithms for denoising.
