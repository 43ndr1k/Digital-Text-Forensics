Abstract
Author discrimination consists of checking whether two texts are written by
the same author or not. In this investigation, we try to make an author discrim-
ination between the Quran (The holy words and statements of God in the Islamic
religion) and the Hadith (statements said by the prophet Muhammad).
The Quran is taken in its entirety, whereas for the Prophet’s statements, we
chose only the certified texts of the Bukhari book. Thus, three series of experi-
ments are done and commented on. The first series of experiments analyses the
two books in a global form (the text of every book is analyzed as a unique big
text). It concerns nine different experiments. The second series of experiments
analyses the two books in a segmental form (four different segments of text are
extracted from every book). It concerns five different experiments. The third
series of experiments makes an automatic authorship attribution of the two
books in a segmental form by employing several classifiers and several types of
features. The sizes of the segments are more or less in the same range (four
different text segments, with approximately the same size, are extracted from
every book). It concerns two different experiments. This investigation sheds
light on an old enigma, which has not been solved for 14 centuries: in fact, all
the results of this investigation have shown that the two books should have two
different authors.

1 Introduction and Related Works
Individuals have distinctive ways of speaking and
writing, as explained by Corney (2003), and there
exists a long history of linguistic and stylistic inves-
tigation into authorship attribution (Holmes, 1998).
In recent years, practical applications of authorship
attribution have grown in areas such as intelligence
(linking intercepted messages to each other and to
known terrorists), criminal law (identifying writers
of ransom notes and harassing letters), civil law
(copyright and estate disputes), and computer
security (tracking authors of computer virus
source code). As reported by Madigan (2005), this
activity is part of a broader growth within computer
science of identification technologies, including bio-
metrics (retinal scanning, speaker recognition, etc),
cryptographic signatures, intrusion detection sys-
tems, and others.
In this research work, we deal with a religious
enigma, which has not been solved for 14 centuries,
as mentioned by Sayoud in 2010. In fact, several
doubts on the origins of the Holy Quran do exist;
some persons thought that the Holy Quran could be

an invention of the prophet Muhammad, for three
purposes (Al-Shreef, 2009):
(1) To facilitate his domination over his
followers;
(2) To frighten the unbelievers and those who
disobey his orders; and
(3) To permit his pleasures.
Several theologians, over time, tried to prove that
this assumption was false. They were relatively logical
and clever, but their proofs were not so convincing
for many people, due to a lack in scientific rigor.
Similarly, for the Christian religion, there exist
several disputes about the origin of some texts of
the Bible. Such disputes are very difficult to solve
due to the delicacy of the problem, the religious
sensitivity and because the texts were written a
long time ago.
One of the purposes of stylometry is authorship
attribution, which is the determination of the author
of a particular piece of text for which there is some
dispute about its writer, as reported by Mills (2003).
Hence, it can be seen why Holmes (Mills, 2003)
pinpointed that the area of stylistic analysis is
the main contribution of statistics to religious stu-
dies. For example, early in the nineteenth century,
Schleiermacher disputed the authorship of the
Pauline Pastoral Epistle 1 Timothy (Mills, 2003). As
a result, other German speaking theologians, namely,
F. C. Baur and H. J. Holtzmann, initiated similar
studies of New Testament books (Mills, 2003).
In such problems, it is crucial to use rigorous
scientific tools and it is important to interpret the
results very carefully.
Hence, knowing that authors possess specific
stylistic features that make them differentiable
(Jiexun, 2006), we tried to make some experiments
of author discrimination between the Quran
and some Prophet’s statements in order to show
that the Quran was not written by the Prophet
Muhammad, if the results of these techniques con-
firm that supposition (Al-Shreef, 2009).
For this purpose, three series of experiments are
made:
The first series of experiments analyses the two
books in a global form: the text of every book is
analyzed as a single large text.
The second series of experiments analyses the
two books in a segmental form: four different seg-
ments of text are extracted from every book.
In the third series of experiments, the author
makes an automatic authorship attribution based
on a Multi-Classifier and Multi-Feature segmental
analysis using the JGAAP toolbox (Juola, 2009),
in order to make an automatic classification of the
different segments extracted from the two books.
The article is organized as follows: Section 2 gives
a description of the two books to be compared.
Section 3 poses the following philosophical prob-
lem: Was the Quran invented by the prophet
Muhammad? Section 4 describes the different ex-
periments of author discrimination. Finally, an
overall discussion is given at the end of the article.
2 Description of the Two Books
Herein, we will give a brief description on the two
books that are investigated in our experiments,
namely: the Quran and Hadith.
2.1 The Quran
The Quran (in Arabic: al-qur’ān, literally ‘the
recitation’; also sometimes transliterated as Qur’ān,
Koran, Alcoran or Al-Qur’ān (Nasr, 2007; Wiki1,
2012) is the central religious text of Islam.
Muslims believe the Quran to be the book of
divine guidance and direction for mankind
(Ibrahim, 1996) (that has been written by God),
and consider this Arabic book to be the final reve-
lation of God. Islam holds that the Quran was writ-
ten by Allah (i.e. God) and transmitted to
Muhammad by the angel Gibraele (Gabriel) over a
period of 23 years. The beginning of Quran appar-
ition was in the year 610 (after the birth of Christ).
2.2 The Hadith
Hadith (in Arabic: , transliteration: al-h
_
adı̄th is
the oral statements and words said by the Islamic
prophet Muhammad (Pbuh) (Islahi, 1989; Wiki2,
2012). Hadith collections are regarded as important
tools for determining the Sunnah, or Muslim way of
life, by all traditional schools of jurisprudence.
In Islamic terminology, the term hadith refers to

reports about the statements or actions of the
Islamic prophet Muhammad, or about his tacit ap-
proval of something said or done in his presence
(Islahi, 1989; Wiki2, 2012). The text of the Hadith
(matn) would most often come in the form of a
speech, injunction, proverb, aphorism or brief dia-
logue of the Prophet whose sense might apply to a
range of new contexts. The Hadith was recorded
from the Prophet for a period of 23 years between
610 and 633 (after the birth of Christ).
3 Was the Quran Invented by
the Prophet Muhammad?
Muslims believe that Muhammad was only the nar-
rator who recited the sentences of the Quran as
written by Allah (God), but not the author. See
what Allah (God) says in the Quran book: ‘O
Messenger (Muhammad)! transmit (the Message)
which has been sent down to you from your Lord.
And if you do not, then you have not conveyed his
Message. Allah will protect you from people. Allah
do not guide the people who disbelieve’ [5:67].
Some doubts about the origins of the Holy
Quran trying to find a human source for this
book do exist. Such assumptions suppose that the
Holy Quran is an invention of the prophet
Muhammad as reported by Al-Shreef (2009).
For a long time, different scientists tried to pre-
sent strong context-based demonstrations showing
that this assumption is impossible.
The purpose of our research work is to conduct a
text-mining-based investigation in order to see
whether the two concerned books could statistically
belong to the same author or not: i.e. authorship
discrimination (Mills, 2003) (Tambouratzis, 2000,
2003), regardless of the literal style or context.
4 Experiments of Author
Discrimination
In this section, three series of experiments of author
discrimination, between the two books, are investi-
gated and commented.
4.1 First series of experiments: global
analysis
The first series of experiments analyses the two
books in a global form (the text of every book is
analyzed as a unique big text). It concerns nine
experiments:
4.1.1 Summary on the size of the two books
The first experiment consists in a computational
investigation, which summarizes the size of the
two books in terms of words, tokens, pages, etc.
The different statistical characteristics of the two
books are summarized as follows:
(1) Number of tokens in the Quran¼ 87,341;
(2) Number of tokens in the Hadith¼ 23,068;
(3) Number of different words in the Quran¼
13,473;
(4) Number of different words in the Hadith¼
6,225;
(5) Ratio of the number of Quran tokens/number
of Hadith tokens¼ 3.79;
(6) Ratio of the number of Quran lines/number
of Hadith lines of Bkh¼ 3.61; and
(7) Ratio of the number of different Quran
words/number of different Hadith words¼
2.16.
The two books seem relatively consistent since
the average number of A4 pages is 315 for the
Quran book and 87 for the Hadith book.
However, the two books do not have the same
size; that is why we should proceed with our inves-
tigation with care.
4.1.2 Word frequency-based analysis
The second experiment is an investigation on the
word frequency. Results are displayed in Fig. 1.
4.1.2.1 Notion of discriminative words. A particular
interest concerns the discriminative words, as we
can see in Fig. 1.
A discriminative word can be seen as a word that
is frequently used in one text and rarely employed in
the other, which could represent a sample word that
can be used for discriminating the two texts.
For instance, suppose that two authors are asked
to write a letter in a same topic. Since every author

has a set of preferred words, one should retrieve
some specific words that are commonly employed
by one author and almost never used by the other
one.
Consequently one could distinguish the two au-
thors (texts) by such discriminative words. That is
why that type of words is investigated in this section
(Fig. 1).
For the words listed above, the frequencies are
relatively different showing a dissimilarity between
the books vocabularies. Note that the first word in
the left (namely ‘ ’), meaning ‘And’ in Arabic, has a
very high frequency. It is used with a frequency of
about 11% in the Quran and 8% in the Hadith,
which involves an average relative difference of
about 30%. The second word from the left
(namely ‘ ’), meaning ‘Those’ in Arabic, has a
relative frequency of 1.12% in the Quran and a
very low relative frequency (approximately 0%) in
the Hadith, which represents an important discrim-
inative word between these books.
The first observation of these histograms shows
that the two books are written by authors using
different vocabulary style.
4.1.3 COST parameter
4.1.3.1 Definition of the COST parameter. Usually,
when poets write a series of poems, they make a
termination similarity between the neighboring sen-
tences of the poem, such as a same final syllable
or letter. To evaluate that termination similarity, a
new parameter estimating the degree of text chain
(in a text of several sentences) has been proposed:
the COST parameter.
Thus, the COST parameter for sentence ‘j’ is
computed by adding all the occurrence marks
(values) between sentence ‘j’ and its neighboring
sentences (sentence ‘j1’ and sentence ‘jþ1’). In
our case, the occurrence marks concern only the
two last letters of the sentence.
It is interesting to note that Quran and Hadith
books do not contain poems, but they consist in
statements, indications, histories, questions and an-
swers, human obligations, advices, description of
God, description of the after-life, etc. The COST
parameter, in this case, can give some information
on the structure of the text (ending structure).
In this investigation, it has been employed to see
if the two texts respect certain regularities in the
text structure or not and, if so, to assess the corres-
ponding regularity ratio.
For instance, let us observe the following English
poem:
(1) Never say it is the end when we do believe ! COST¼ 2
(2) And never accept that you do not retrieve ! COST¼ 2
(3) Life is so short to let things kill our mind ! COST¼ 2
(4) What to do in such situations dear friend ! COST¼ 4
(5) It is true that it is hard but victory will
be in hand
! COST¼ 2
(6) Do not hesitate to try if you can make
any change
! COST¼ 1
(7) Yes it is worth trying even if it is the
last chance
! COST¼ 1
If we consider the fourth sentence (ending with
‘nd’), we notice that the previous and next sentences

(sentence 3 and 5) are ended with the same last two
characters (i.e. ‘nd’).
So by counting the number of similar characters
[i.e. (1þ1)þ (1þ1)¼ 4], we get a COST value of
four. The same procedure is repeated for each
sentence until the last one.
For concreteness, here are the COST values for
some Hadith sentences (Table 1) and the COST
values of some Quran sentences (Table 2).
According to these tables, we remark that for the
Hadith mixture, there are many COST values equal
to zero; and when the COST is non-null, it has very
small values: the average COST is only 0.46.
For the Quran, we notice that the COST is
almost never null and the corresponding values
are relatively high: the average COST of the Quran
is approximately 2.52.
This fact means that the structure of the Quran is
very different from the Hadith one. Consequently,
the two books must have two different author styles.
4.1.4 Word length frequency-based analysis
The fourth experiment is an investigation on the
word length frequency. Herein, we must define
some technical terms employed in our article:
(1) The word length is the number of letters com-
posing that word.
(2) The word length frequency F(n) for a specific
length ‘n’, represents the number (in percent)
of words composed of n letters each, present
in the text.
In Fig. 2, the two spectra are represented simul-
taneously, which gives an interesting way to com-
pare the two books. So, let us assume that FQuran(j)
is the frequency of the words with ‘j’ letters in the
Quran and FHadith(j) is the frequency of the words
with ‘j’ letters in the Hadith subset. Then, the ob-
servations related to every word length are given
here below:
(1) Length 1: FQuran (1)¼ 10.95%, whereas
FHadith (1)¼ 8.03%; which shows that the
words composed of a single letter are much
more frequently used in the Quran than in the
Hadith subset. For this frequency we notice a
great difference between the two books. The
Pearson 2 (uncorrected for continuity) re-
garding this result is 167.54, involving a prob-
ability of consistency P < 0.0001, consequently
results related to one-word frequency appear
to be significant.

(2) Lengths 2, 3 and 4: For these cases, the Hadith
subset contains many more words than the
Quran. We conclude that the Hadith subset
uses much more short words than the Quran.
The number of short words in the Hadith
subset is 62.31%, whereas, in the Quran, it
is only 53.76%: namely a difference of
8.55%. The Pearson 2 (uncorrected for con-
tinuity) regarding this result is 468.37, invol-
ving a probability of consistency P < 0.00001,
consequently results related to short-word fre-
quency appear to be significant.
(3) Lengths 5, 6, 7 and 8: For these cases, the
Quran uses much more words than the
Hadith subset. The number of long words in
the Quran is 34.42%, whereas, in the Hadith
subset, it is only 29.51%: namely a difference
of 4.91%. The Pearson 2 (uncorrected
for continuity) regarding this result is
198.3, involving a probability of consistency
P < 0.0001, consequently results related to
long-word frequency appear to be significant.
(4) Lengths 9 and 10: The Quran contains ap-
proximately a double number of words with
nine and ten letters than the Hadith. This fact
shows that the Quran vocabulary contains
more very-long words (very-long stands for
more than eight letters) than the Hadith.
The Pearson 2 (uncorrected for continuity)
regarding this result is 10.78, involving a
probability of consistency P < 0.001. Even
though the consistency probability is lower
in this case, results related to very-long-word
frequency appear to be significant enough.
So, according to all these observations we con-
clude that the two authors have different styles.
4.1.5 Character frequency-based analysis
The fifth experiment makes a comparison between
the character frequencies of the two books (Fig. 3).
From Figure 3, we did a sorting of the differences
between the two frequencies (Quran frequency and
Hadith frequency), for all the characters, in a des-
cending order. At the end we kept only the sixteen
first characters that have been sorted (Fig. 4). In
Figure 3, we have represented the character frequen-
cies used in the two books. We can see, for example,
that for the first five characters (i.e. and )
the difference between the utilization frequencies
in the two books is appreciable. This observation
implies two different writing styles for the two
books.

4.1.6 Discriminative words
In the sixth experiment, we look for the words that
are present in one book and absent in the other.
4.1.6.1 Definition of ‘word’. In our investigation, a
word represents a sequence of characters linked to
form a noun, verb, complement, preposition, or a
fusion of a preposition and another word (noun/
verb) if they are linked without space.
In this experiment, we analyze all the words pre-
sent in the Hadith, and try to see if there is any
occurrence in the Quran. Similarly, on the other
hand, we analyze all the words present in the
Quran, and try to see if there is any occurrence in
the Hadith. If a word is present in only one book, it
will be retained; otherwise it will not be taken into
consideration. The word can be a name, verb, com-
plement, or a simple expression.
We recall that the part of the Bukhari Hadith
contains 23,068 tokens and 6,225 different words.
The Quran contains 87,339 tokens and 13,473 dif-
ferent words.
Results of this experiment show that 62% of the
Bukhari Hadith words are untraceable in the Quran
and 83% of the Quran words are untraceable in the
Bukhari Hadith (Figs 5 and 6). Such tokens are
called Discriminant Words (we chose this appella-
tion due to the proposed application of discrimin-
ation).
4.1.6.2 Observation and discussion. Practically, it
is impossible for a same author to write two
books (related to a similar topic) with a so great
difference in the vocabulary. Therefore, we can
deduce that the two books should come from two
authors who are characterized by two different
vocabularies.
4.1.7 Numbers citation-based analysis
The seventh experiment investigates the citation of
numbers in the text: How many times a specific
number (zero to nine) has been used in the books?
In Figure 7, we can easily notice that the
most frequently cited number, in the Quran, is
Fig. 4 Frequency of the most discriminant Arabic characters.
Fig. 3 Frequency of all the Arabic characters.

the number ‘1’, whereas for the Hadith it is the
number ‘3’.
We also notice that both books use more odd
numbers than even ones, except for the Quran
book regarding the number ‘5’, where it appears
to be the less used non-null number, which is not
the case for the Hadith (its corresponding frequency
is about 10%).
In this experiment, the difference regarding the
use of numbers, between the two books, is so dif-
ferent that we can state that the authors should
probably be different.
4.1.8 Animal citation-based analysis
The eighth experiment investigates the citation of
animals in the text.
The animal citation frequency (Freq.) is defined
as follows:
Freq. in %¼ 100. (frequency of occurrence)/
(total number of animal citations)
Example:
Freq. in Quran¼ 100. (frequency of occur-
rence)/155, since the total number of animal
citations was 155.
Freq. in Hadith¼ 100. (frequency of occur-
rence)/94, since the total number of animal
citations was 94.
4.1.8.1 First observation. The following Table 3
shows that for the seven following animals, the dif-
ference in citation between the two books is rela-
tively great:
 The name / (general name of kamels,
cows, and sheeps) is cited thirty three times in
the Quran, whereas in the Bukhari Hadith it is
cited only two times;
 The name (dog) is cited only five times in the
Quran, whereas in the Bukhari Hadith it is cited
thirteen times;
 The name (sheep) is completely absent in the
Quran, whereas in the Bukhari Hadith it is cited
ten times;
 The name (animal) is cited seventeen times in
the Quran, whereas in the Bukhari Hadith it is
cited only three times;
 The name (camel) is cited only two times in
the Quran, whereas in the Bukhari Hadith it is
cited seven times;
 The name (calf) is cited ten times in the
Quran, whereas in the Bukhari Hadith it is com-
pletely absent; and
 The name (fish) is cited only four times in
the Quran, whereas in the Bukhari Hadith it is
cited eight times.
Fig. 6 Quran words never used in Bukhari Hadith: 11,133
different words (over 13,473 total different words con-
tained in Quran): 11,133/13,473¼ 82.63% of words
absent in Hadith.
Fig. 5 Hadith words never used in Quran: 3,885 different
words (over 6,225 total different words contained in
Bukhari Hadith): 3,885/6,225¼ 62.41% of words absent
in Quran.

4.1.8.2 Second observation. In Table 4, we quote
the animals that are quoted in the Quran but com-
pletely absent in the Bukhari Hadith. There are
twenty nine such animal names.
We remark that several animal names are not
cited in the Bukhari Hadith and particularly
the name (calf), which is cited ten times in
the Quran and which is completely absent in the
Bukhari Hadith.
4.1.8.3 Third observation. In Table 5, we quote the
animals that are quoted in the Bukhari Hadith but
completely absent in the Quran. There are eleven
such animal names.
A particular observation can be done about the
name (sheep), which is cited ten times in the
Bukhari Hadith and which is completely absent in
the Quran.

Discussion: results show that there are different
animal name citations in the two books. That is, two
cases are possible:
(1) the two books could be related to two topics
that are contextually different, citing a con-
textual type of animal consequently;
(2) or the two authors should have different styl-
istic preferences for animal appellations and
citations.
However, when we read the two books, we notice
that the topics are mainly the same. This fact pro-
poses that the second case is the most probable in
this investigation.
4.1.9 Special ending bigrams
This special investigation is made on six ending
bigrams, which are often used in Arabic. The
bigram consists of a succession of two successive
characters in the text.
For example, in the sentence ‘The cat is here’,
the following syllables ‘Th’, ‘he’, and ‘ca’ represent
bigrams. Also, in the same sentence, the following syl-
lables ‘he-’, ‘at-’, and ‘is-’ represent ending bigrams,
where the ‘-’ symbol represents a space or a line-feed.
The different bigrams that have been chosen in
this investigation are as follows:
‘- ’
‘- ’
‘- ’
‘- ’
‘- ’
‘- ’
Usually, these bigrams (except the third and
fourth ones) are often related to the plural form
in Arabic.
We notice, in Fig. 8, that there is a great differ-
ence in the use of these ending bigrams between the
Quran (where the frequency is relatively high) and
the Bukhari Hadith (where the frequency is rela-
tively low), especially for the two first bigrams and
the two last bigrams.
This phenomenon can be justified by the fact
that the Quran uses much more frequently the
plural form in its sentences.

So the authors of the two books appear to have
different styles of writing: in the Quran, the plural
form is more employed than in Hadith.
4.2 Second series of experiments:
segmental analysis
The second series of experiments analyses the two
books in a segmental form: four different segments
of texts are extracted from every book and the dif-
ferent texts are analyzed and compared.
In such tasks of authorship attribution or dis-
crimination, several linguistic features have been
proposed by different researchers. We can quote
four main types of these features:
Vocabulary-based features: a simple way to con-
firm or refute authorship is to look for something
that completely settles the authorship question
(Juola, 2006). It is clear, then, that the individual
words an author uses can reveal his or her identity.
The problem with such features is that the data can
be faked easily. A more reliable method would be
able to take into account a large fraction of the
words in the document (Juola, 2006) as the average
sentence length.
Syntax-based features: one reason that function
words perform well is because they are topic-
independent (Juola, 2006). A person’s preferred
syntactic constructions can be cues to his author-
ship. One simple way to capture this is to tag
the relevant documents for part of speech or other
syntactic constructions (Stamatatos, 2001) using a
tagger.
Orthographic-based features: one weakness of
vocabulary-based approaches is that they do not
take advantage of morphologically related words.
A person who writes of ‘work’ is also likely to
write of ‘working’, ‘worker’, etc. (Juola, 2006).
Characters-based features: some researchers
(Peng, 2003) have proposed to analyze documents
as sequences of characters. For example, the
character four-gram ‘work’ is shared in the previous
example by all the words. That is why this type of
parameter can replace several other high-level lin-
guistic features. Furthermore, several experiments
showed that character n-gram is one of the most
reliable and robust features in authorship attribu-
tion (Stamatatos, 2009).
In this section, the author proposes some types
of features and describes five related experiments:
an experiment using discriminative words, a word
length frequency-based analysis, an experiment
using the COST parameter, an investigation on dis-
criminative characters and an experiment based on
vocabulary similarities.
In these experiments, the different segments are
chosen as follows: one segment is extracted from the
beginning of the book, another one from the end
and the two other segments are extracted from the
middle area of the book. A segment size is about ten
standard pages and all the segments are distinct and
separated (without intersection). These segments
are denoted Q1 (or Quran 1), Q2 (or Quran 2),
Q3 (or Quran 3), Q4 (or Quran 4), H1 (or
Hadith 1), H2 (or Hadith 2), H3 (or Hadith 3),
and H4 (or Hadith 4). Finally, these eight texts seg-
ments are more or less comparable in size.
4.2.1 Discriminative words
This first experiment investigates the use of some
words that are very commonly used in only one of
the books. In practice, we remarked that the words:
(in English: THOSE or WHO in a plural form)
and (in English: EARTH) are very commonly
used in the four Quran segments; whereas, in the
Hadith segments, these words are rarely used, as we
can see in Table 6.
For the frequency of occurrence is over 0.7%
in the Quran segments, but it is between 0.02 and
0.11% in the Hadith segments (namely almost the
one-tenth of the Quran frequency).
Table 6 Some discriminative words and their frequencies

For the frequency of occurrence is about
0.5% in the Quran segments, but it is between 0.13
and 0.23% in the Hadith segments (namely about
the half).
These results show that the author of the Quran
uses much more frequently these particular words
than the Hadith author does.
4.2.2 Word length frequency-based analysis
The second experiment is an investigation on
the word length frequency. In Fig. 9, the different
curves (smoothed curves), representing the ‘word
length frequency’ versus the ‘word length’, show
the following two important points:
(1) The Hadith curves have more or less a gaus-
sian shape that is pretty smooth; whereas the
Quran curves seem to be less Gaussian and
present some oscillations (distortions).
(2) The Hadith curves are easily distinguishable
from the Quran ones, particularly for the
lengths 1, 3, 4, and 8: for the lengths 1 and
8, Quran possesses higher frequencies,
whereas for the lengths 3 and 4, Hadith pos-
sesses higher frequencies.
The statistical consistency of the discrimination
between the two groups, using frequency of mono-
grams, trigrams, tetragrams, or octograms-based
words, which is evaluated with Fisher’s exact test,
corresponds to a probability P of 2.86%.
Although these results cannot be used accurately
in authorship discrimination, they can give prelim-
inary information on the sizes of the preferred
words by each author. That is, according to these
results we should expect that the two text groups
correspond to different authors.
4.2.3 COST parameter
The third experiment concerns the new COST par-
ameter which appears non-null only in the Holy
Quran, as we can see in Table 7. The COST param-
eter is explained in Section 4.1.3.
In fact, it measures the termination similarity
between the neighboring sentences of a text, such
as a same final syllable or letter. That is, the COST

parameter gives us assessment on the text organiza-
tion in term of ending structure.
Table 7 shows the average COST values of the
eight different segments.
We notice that the average value of COST is
practically constant for all the Quran segments: it
is about 2.2 at the beginning of the Quran, 2.4 at the
end, and it is about 2.6 in the area of the middle.
Similarly, this parameter appears constant for all
the Hadith segments: it is about 0.46.
In addition, we notice that the mean values of the
COST for Quran and Hadith are very different. This
great difference involves distinctive writing styles for
the two books (i.e. two different styles concerning
the sentence ending).
4.2.4 Discriminative characters
The fourth experiment investigates the use of some
characters that are very commonly used in only one
of the books.
In reality, we limited our investigation to one of
the most interesting character, which seems to be
very discriminative between the two books: it is
the character ‘ ’, which is a consonant and vowel
in a same time (in English, it is equivalent to the
consonant W when used as consonant; or the vowel
U when used as vowel).
Furthermore, this character is important because
it also represents the preposition AND (in English),
which is widely used in Arabic.
So, by observing Table 8, we notice that this
character has a frequency of about 7% in all
Quran segments and a frequency of about 5% in
all Hadith segments.
This difference in the character frequency shows
that the 2 authors do not employ the character in
the same proportion.
4.2.5 Vocabulary-based similarity
The fifth experiment makes an estimation of the
similarity between the vocabularies (words) of the
two books.
So, in this investigation we propose a new vo-
cabulary similarity measure that we called VSM (i.e.
vocabulary similarity measure), which is defined as
follows:
VSM (text1, text2)¼ (number of common words
between the two texts)/[size(text1).size(text2)]1/2
Typically, in case of two identical texts, this simi-
larity measure will have a value of one (i.e. 100%).
Hence, the higher this measure is, the more similar
(in terms of vocabulary) the two texts are.
We recall that there are four texts of the Quran
and four texts of the Hadith that are more or less
comparable in size.
The different inter-measures of similarity are
represented in the following matrix (similarity
matrix), which is displayed in Table 9.
We notice that all the diagonal elements are
equal to 100%. We do remark also that all the
Q–Q similarities and H–H similarities are high,
relatively to Q–H or H–Q ones (Q stands for a
Quran segment and H stands for a Hadith segment).
This means that the four segments of the Quran
have a great similarity in vocabulary and the four
segments of the Hadith have a great similarity in
vocabulary, too. On the other hand it implies a
low similarity between the vocabulary styles of the

two different books. This deduction can easily be
made from Table 10, which represents the mean
similarity measure between one segment and all
the segments of a given book.
Table 10 gives the mean similarity according to
Quran or Hadith for each segment X (X¼Qi or
X¼Hi i¼ 1 to 4), which can be expressed as the
average of all the similarities between segment X and
the different segments of a same book. Table 10 is
displayed in order to see if a segment is more similar
to the Quran family or to the Hadith family.
Similarly, we remark that the intra-similarities
(within a same book) are high: between 26 and
31%; and that the inter-similarities (segments
from different books) are relatively low: not exceed-
ing 20%. This observation shows that all the seg-
ments of a same book appear to have a unique
origin and that the two books should have two dif-
ferent author styles.
4.3 Third series of experiments:
automatic authorship attribution with
several features and several classifiers
The third series of experiments, which consists in
an automatic authorship attribution (Sanderson,
2006), analyses the two books in a segmental form
by using several features (words, word n-grams,
characters, character n-grams, and dis-legomena)
(Clement 2003) and several classifiers: Camberra
distance, cosine distance, Ryan-Noecker (RN)
cross-entropy, histogram distance, intersection dis-
tance, Kullback-Leibler distance, Manhattan dis-
tance, Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and
Naı̈ve Bayes classifier (Juola, 2009).
The sizes of the segments are more or less in the
same range: four different text segments, with ap-
proximately the same size, are extracted from every
book (the same dataset as in experiment 4.2.5).
It concerns two experiments:
(1) In the first experiment, the first segment of
each book is taken as reference. Hence there
will be two reference texts, one representing
the Quran author and the other representing
the Hadith author. The six remaining texts
(three for each book) have to be classified
into Quran class or Hadith class.
(2) The second experiment is similar to the first
one except that the reference texts, here, are
represented by the second segments of the two
books, respectively.
In this series of experiments, the author employs
the JGAA software (Juola, 2009) to make an

automatic classification of the eight texts by using
different features and different classifiers.
Concerning the number of selected examples (an
example refers to a word, character, etc), we have
considered two cases: in the first case, we consider
all the examples and in the second case, we keep
only the fifty most frequent ones.
Note: in the following paragraphs, a score of
100% means that all the Quran segments are classi-
fied as Quran class and all the Hadith segments
are classified as Hadith class, without any error of
attribution.
4.3.1 First experiment
In the following investigation, we consider the seg-
ments Q1 and H1 as reference texts for the Quran
and Hadith, respectively. Then, Q2, Q3, Q4, H2,
H3, and H4 will be considered as unknown texts
to be classified according to Quran class or Hadith
class. During the feature extraction step, two cases
are possible: employing all the features or employing
the most frequent ones.
In this experiment, all the text segments have to
be classified into two classes: Quran class or Hadith
class. Classification results (displayed in %) are re-
ported in Table 11.
This experiment employing several features
(words, word n-grams, characters, character n-
grams and dis-legomena) and several classifiers
(Camberra distance, cosine distance, RN cross en-
tropy, histogram distance, intersection distance,
Kullback Leibler distance, Manhattan distance,
LDA analysis, and Naı̈ve Bayes classifier), shows
clearly that the four Quran segments should
belong to a same author, the four Hadith segments
should belong to the same author too and that these
two authors are likely to be different.
4.3.2 Second experiment
In the following investigation, we consider the seg-
ments Q2 and H2 as reference texts for the Quran
and Hadith, respectively. Then, Q1, Q3, Q4, H1,
H3, and H4 will be considered as unknown texts
to be classified according to Quran class or Hadith
class. As previously, during the features extraction
step, two cases are possible: employing all the fea-
tures or employing the most frequent ones.
Also, in this experiment all the text segments
have to be classified into two classes: Quran class
or Hadith class. Results of good classification, dis-
played in %, are reported in Table 12.
As in the first investigation, this experiment em-
ploying several features (words, word n-grams,
characters, character n-grams, and dis-legomena)
and several classifiers (Camberra distance, cosine
distance, RN cross entropy, histogram distance,
intersection distance, Kullback Leibler distance,
Manhattan distance, LDA analysis and Naı̈ve Bayes
classifier), shows clearly that the four Quran seg-
ments should belong to the same author, the four
Hadith segments should belong to the same author

too and that these two authors are very probably
different.
Discussion on these two experiments (Sections
4.3.1 and 4.3.2): according to these two experi-
ments, we can clearly see that the classification ac-
curacy for the two books is 100% with almost all
features and all classifiers. Consequently, we can
statistically state that the two investigated books
have two different authors or at least two different
styles.
5 Discussion
In this research work, we have made an investiga-
tion of authorship discrimination (Tambouratzis,
2000, 2003) between two old Arabic books: the
Quran and Bukhari Hadith.
For that purpose, we made three series of experi-
ments:
The first series of experiments, which consists of
nine experiments, analyses the two books in a global
form.
The second series, consisting of five experiments,
analyses the two books in a segmental form by using
statistical techniques of stylometry.
The third series of experiments, which consists of
two experiments, analyses the two books in a seg-
mental form by using state-of-the-art techniques of
stylometry and by employing several classifiers and
several types of features.
Results of all experiments have led to two main
conclusions:
(1) First, the two investigated books should have
different authors;
(2) Second, all the segments that are extracted
from a unique book appear to have a certain
stylistic similarity.
Consequently, we can conclude, according to this
investigation, that the Quran was not written by the
Prophet Muhammad and that it belongs to a unique
author too. Muslims believe that it is written by
Allah (God) and sent to his messenger (the prophet
Muhammad). We will not extend our research work
into an etymological point of view: this is not the
main topic of this work, but we think that it may be
interesting to mention this point.
The result of this investigation rejects, then, the
doubts assuming that the Quran was written by the
Prophet and it confirms what has been stated by
Muhammad: that the Quran has been transmitted
to him (by Allah).
