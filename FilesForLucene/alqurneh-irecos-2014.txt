Abstract – Automated text classification by means of machine learning algorithms has been measured recently as a 
necessary process to handle and process Quranic studies. In general, machine learning algorithms participate an 
important task in feature extraction and topic retrieval. This paper presents an oath detection approach based on a 
Bayesian model to extract oath style markers that fulfill automated oath topic retrieval in the Quranic text. The 
experiments were performed on large and small datasets that contain oath using several machine language algorithms. 
The results obtained that machine learning algorithms are well performed in small-size dataset contains higher 
percentage of oath statement, and IBK and Multilayer Perceptron classifiers performed better results compare to J48 
and BN classifiers.   Copyright © 2014 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l. - All rights reserved.

I. Introduction 
An oath (Qasam) is defined as a solemn appeal to a 
deity stand to attest the truth of a statement. This is the 
verb (swear) Aqsam or Uqsim in Arabic [1] to distinguish 
between right and wrong [2]. It is a common practice 
across many cultures and has been part of law-related 
procedures for many centuries.  
The syntactical structure of the Quranic oath in 
general consists of two statements, for example an oath 
‘I swear by God, so and so will occur’. The first 
statement is called the oath statement, which contains a 
verb or a noun that directly indicates the ‘swearing’ 
action, a character b'ب' to mean ‘by’ and an object of 
‘God’. The second statement is called the oath answer 
statement or the effect of such oath [3].  
In general, the Quranic oaths are one of two types. 
The first type is the one when God swears by His 
essence or by His creations [2]. When the oath statement 
exists in this oath expression, it is called apparent oath, 
and oath expression might start with character w 'و' or 
keyword 'lā uqsim ' [32]. For instance the verse 4:65 in 
surah Women (Al-Nisa') that translates to ‘By your Lord, 
they will not be true believers until they let you decide 
between them in all matters of dispute, and find no 
resistance in their souls to your decisions, accepting them 
totally'. If it is not appear then it is called hidden oath. 
The second type is when oath comes through descriptive 
or narrative human stories. Fig. 1 shows the 
classification of Quranic oath expressions. 
 
 
 
 
 
Fig. 1. Oath classification in the Quran 
 
Back to Fig. 1, the secondary classification to oath 
expressions is the narrative oaths, which are oaths taken 
by God in the form of narration from old people stories 
[2]. Hassan Describes two cases of narrative oaths [2]. 
The first case is similar to general oath syntax; whereby 
oath verb, character b 'ب', and object exist, as in surah 
Livestock (Al-Anam) verse 6:109 that translates to ‘They 
swear by God with their most solemn oaths that if a 
miraculous sign came to them they would believe in it. 
Say [Prophet], ‘Signs are in the power of God alone.’ 
What will make you [believers] realize that even if a sign 
came to them they still would not believe?’. The second 
case is the particular use of  t 'ت' character, as in surah 
The Prophets (Al-Anbiya) verse 21:57 [2] that translates 
to ‘By God(Allah) I shall certainly plot against your idols 
as soon as you have turned your backs!’, which is used 
only when the oath object is ‘Allah’ and no others [4]. 
The Quranic oath has been widely studied from 
theoretical base in Islamic Studies [2, 3, 4, and 5]. 
However, to the best of our knowledge, it has not being 
studied from computational perspective. This research 
proposes a new Bayesian model for detection of apparent 
oaths and narrative oaths. In achieving this, we will 
investigate two types of domain-specific features that are 
related to domain-specific and application-specific 
features, which are structural and content-specific [6]. 
Then, to investigate the relationship of the extracted 
features, this research built a Bayesian network model 
based on the following:

a. For the head of the surahs text, analysis based on the 
structural feature (head of surah with special starting 
character or special starting keyword), which is 
highly required. This refers to the head of surahs, 
such as verse 1 or verse 2 if the surah starts with a 
special character or keyword. The feature of special 
ending bigrams has been used for authorship 
attribution between the Quran and Hadith [7]. 
b. For the middle or end of the surahs text, analysis based 
on the content-specific (keywords) features only, 
which is highly required, if exists. The analysis 
based on character in the middle of the surahs 
requires complex morphological analysis, therefore 
it was exempted from this research.    
II. Related Work 
 
Machine learning algorithms has been used widely 
in the fields that concern of text such as data mining 
and text mining, mainly to study the linguistic style in 
a written text.  Style can be defined as a set of patterns 
which can be measured and might be unique to an 
author [8], hence the term style markers used to 
measure writing style [6].  
The computational system modules in text style 
analysis involve two main steps. First, extraction of 
style markers and, second is classification of the text 
according to these features [9].  Style markers are 
classified into five categories, which are lexical, 
character, syntactic, semantic, and application specific 
features [6]. Works in computational stylistics [10] 
focus on two main areas, which are authorship 
attribution and text genre detection [9]. Authorship 
attribution is defined as the problem of determining 
the writer of an anonymous text [11], which surfaced 
from old literary works on unknown authors [12]. In 
the essence, authorship attribution concerns on 
proving authorship of unknown or disputed text [9] by 
means of extracting and identifying stylistic features in 
the writing that is able to reveal specific traits in an 
author, hence distinguishing the person's genuine 
writing styles [8].  
Genre is defined as the totality of characteristics we 
observe in a text that gives a unique print [13]. Text 
genre detection concerns on identification of the kind 
of the text [9] based on similar feature characteristics 
among texts.  
Arabic text is widely studied from the perspective 
of linguistic analysis [14] such as analysis of modern 
standard Arabic and its dialects [14, 15, and 16], verb 
classification [17], letter shape generator [18], text 
classification [19, 20, 21, and 22] as well as clitics on 
Arabic texts [23]. Style features used in these works 
include token-based [16, 17], character-based [18], 
and character-based n-gram [19]. The analysis 
performed on the style features are based on statistical 
approach such as the n-gram frequency in [19] as well 
as machine learning approach such as Bayes Classifier 
in [22]. 
With regards to the Quranic text, the Holy Qur’an is 
written in classical Arabic language. The Quran is an 
eloquent religious text written by God (Allah) in an 
adorable literary style, structurally looks as poetic 
language [24] and it has its unique genre recognized 
through two elements, rhetorical and cohesive [25]. 
The text consists of 114 surahs of varying lengths and 
different verses length [26]. Machine learning 
algorithms used in computational work with regards to 
Quranic text includes the study to categorize Quranic 
chapters revealed in Mecca and chapters revealed in 
Medina [27, 28], as well as to classify the chronology 
of the Quran [29]. Work by [30] and [31] are all 
related to text classification on Hadith. 
With regards to style features in computational studies 
of the Quranic text, [27, 28, and 29] use token-based 
features such as word frequency and sentence frequency 
with a machine language classification technique such as 
the naïve Bayes to classify the Quranic chapters. 
Similarly, [7] uses machine learning algorithms in his 
authorship discriminative study between Quranic text 
and Hadith text.  
III. Oath Application Model 
From the literature, oath expressions (i.e apparent) 
may begin with the oath character w 'و' or the phrase lā 
uqsim (indeed I swear) [32]. Meanwhile, [2] and [3] 
discuss in depth the object in oath statements and 
conclude that such noun normally refers to God's essence 
or a creation or a universal phenomenon [4]. For 
example, from the translation of verse 103:1, the noun is 
Al Asr and it is referring to a phenomenon, which is ‘the 
declining day’. Additional characteristic of oath 
expressions is that it might also appear with its 
continuous oath conjunction as appears in Juz' 'Amma 
which is the last chapter of the Quran (Chapter 30), it 
contains 37 surahs (texts), start with the surah number 78 
named as The Announcement (Al-Naba') and last with 
surah number 114 named as People (Al-Nas) and its 
surahs are primarily concerned with oneness of Allah, 
day of judgment and afterlife [3].  
The literature [2, 4, and 5] classifies the Quranic oath 
based on the oath taker and oath objects. In apparent 
oath, oath-taking is by God and the verse directly refers 
to an object, which is either the God’s essence (dhāt'u' 
Allah) or His creations. This research propose a special 
starting character/keyword at the head of surah to 
differentiate the apparent oaths start with w 'و' as well as 
a number of content-specific keywords that are related to 
negative clause like lā uqsim. For the narrative oath, we 
propose to use content-specific keywords only to detect 
 
A. Alqurneh, A. Mustapha

narrative oath keywords like (aqsam-u b- Allah'i) and (t-
Allah'i).  
Following [6], the proposed style features consists of 
application-specific, structural features together with 
content-specific keywords to detect the oaths. 
Application-specific features are important because they 
are applicable to any language even for oriental 
languages. As shown in Fig. 2, which is a mapping of 
structural and content-specific features to the linguistic 
model of oaths, structural features will be based on the 
head of the surah contains a special starting character or 
keywords at the head of the surah, while content-specific 
keywords will be based on certain keywords that appear 
in the middle or the end of the surah. In the case of 
apparent oath, at the head of the surah, we relate the 
character to w 'و ', and phrases contained keyword (lā 
uqsim), whereby the oath verb swear (uqsim) is preceded 
by the negative particle lā. For the middle ot end parts of 
the surah, we relate only to the keyword (lā uqsim).  
In the case of narrative oath, we relate the keywords to 
the phrases (aqsamu b Allah'i) and (t Allah'i) [2].

IV. Bayesian Network Model for Oaths 
This section represents the proposed Bayesian model 
for oaths. A Bayesian network is a graphical model for 
probabilistic relationships among a set of features. In 
particular, each node in the graph represents a variable, 
while the edges between the nodes represent probabilistic 
dependencies among the corresponding variables. The 
network structure is in the form of directed acyclic graph 
(DAG) and enables effective representation and 
computation of the joint probability distribution (JPD) 
over a set of variables. 
In oath detection, we would like to identify if a verse 
is a structural-based oath or content-specific-based oath, 
such that P (oath type | verse) is the highest. To model 
the Bayesian network, we selected all verses from 114

surahs. The Quran contains 6,236 verses (ayat) altogether 
from surah The Opening (Al-Fatiha) (Surah 1) to surah 
People (Al-Nas) (Surah 114) with varying length. For 
structural-based oath model, this provided us a total of 
114 instances from the entire Quran. For content-specific 
oath model, this provided us a total of 6,236 instances 
from the entire Quran.  
The structure of a directed-acyclic graph (DAG) in a 
Bayesian network is defined by the set of nodes and a set 
of directed edges. The nodes represent the oath features 
extracted from the Quranic verses and are drawn as 
circles labeled with the variable names. The edges 
represent direct dependence among the variables and are 
drawn by arrows between nodes. Table 3 shows choice 
of nodes to represent the oath features for the Bayesian 
model.

In addition to the DAG structure, we need to specify

V. Experiments of Oath Expression 
Detection 
 
Detection of oath statement for human might be 
applicable when the oath statement contains a swearing 
verb as a main keyword. However, oath types in Quran 
as described above may occur without swearing verb, in 
particular when it is one word (noun) such as the oath 
started with character 'w'. Therefore, for this purpose, in 
this section, in the first stage of this research we present 
a machine learning approach to oath detection based on 
the proposed application-specific feature model. It covers 
three classification experiments using the structural and 
content-specific oath features with several classifiers, 
which are Bayesian network, decision tree, instance-
based learning, and neural network. The experiments 
performed on three different dataset, apparent dataset, 
apparent and narrative dataset, and Juz' 'Amma dataset. 
V.1. Dataset Preparation 
 In the first experiment, the dataset includes only the 
apparent oath, which means oaths that use creation 
as oath object (e.g. start with 'w', start with 'lā 
uqsim').  Classification is performed on verses using 
the structural features and the content-specific 
(keyword). 
 The second experiment is similar to the first 
experiment with additional two cases of narrative 
oaths to the dataset ("aqsam'ū  b'iAllah'i ", "t-Allah'i 
"). 
 The third experiment is a repetition of previous 
experiments specifically for Juz' 'Amma dataset, as 
opposed to global text in the Quran.  
 Structural feature is used to detect the oath statement 
occur at the head of the surah. Therefore, if oath is 
detected at the head of the surah then it is a 
structural oath, while content-specific feature is used 
to detect oath statement keyword occur at the 
remaining part of the surah. In this case, oath is a 
keyword oath base.  
 
The main objective of the classification experiments is 
to evaluate the proposed application-specific oath 
features extracted from the Quranic verses in large and 
small datasets contains oath statements. To do this, we 
used three evaluation measures, which are precision, 
recall, and F-measure as the basis of our comparison 
between Bayesian networks and other machine learning 
algorithms. To control the bias in error rates, we applied 
10-fold cross validation [33] to split the Quran text into 
ten approximately equal partitions training and testing 
set, each being used in turn for testing while the 
remainder combined for training. 
V.2. Experiments on Large  Dataset 
In the following experiments, two large datasets are 
used. First is the apparent oath dataset, second is the 
apparent and narrative dataset. Both structural-based and 
content-specific were applied. For structural features the 
first 114 verses from the 114 surahs is chosen, and for 
content-based features the 6,236 verses from the 114 
surahs of Quran for the style feature analysis is chosen.  
V.2.1. First Experiment: Apparent Oaths 
In this experiment, all the application-specific features 
are used, which include the structural-based and content-
specific features. The classification results are shown in 
Table 6. All the measurements of precision, recall, and F-
measure showed that IBK, and Multilayer Perceptron 
give better results than BN and J48.

Narrative Oaths 
In this experiment the narrative oaths were added to 
the apparent dataset, all the application-specific features 
are used, which include the structural-based and content-
specific features. The classification results are shown in 
Table 7. All the measurements of precision, recall, and F-
measure showed that IBK, Multilayer Perceptron, and 
J48 give better results than BN.

The results in Table 6 and Table 7 are mainly 
attributed to the fact that our proposed application-
specific oath feature model has produced approximately 
45 instances out of 6,236 instances from the entire Quran 
dataset. Therefore, the application-specific features are 
worth to be investigated in a smaller dataset. For this

purpose, we have chosen Juz' 'Amma (Chapter 30) from 
the Quran for the third experiment. This is justified by 
the finding that oaths exist in more than 40% of the 
surahs in this Juz [3], hence it is fertile environment to 
perform the classification experiments.  
V.3. Experiment on Small Dataset 
In the following experiment, for structural-based 
features we consider the first 37 verses from the 37 
surahs and for content-based features we consider the 
564 verses from the 37 surahs of Quran for the style 
feature analysis. 
V.3.1 Juz’ ‘Amma Experiment  
In this experiment, all the application-specific features 
are used, which include the structural-based and content-
specific features. The classification results are 
represented in Table 8. The measurements of precision 
and F-measure showed that IBK and Multilayer 
Perceptron give better results than J48 and BN.

VI. Conclusion 
 
This paper proposed a computational model for oath 
and oath-like expressions using application-specific 
features from the Quranic text, which include apparent 
oaths and two cases of narrative oaths with the basis of 
Bayesian network model. The justification for analyzing 
oath and oath-like expressions from style viewpoint is 
because only through style markers that the essence of 
writing style for oaths in the Quranic text can be 
captured and quantified.  
We then employed Bayesian network to model the 
structural-based and content-specific oath features.  In 
evaluating the style markers model, we designed and 
conducted three experiments. The first experiment is 
performed on large dataset (entire Quran text) to detect 
apparent oaths using the application features; structural, 
and content-specific. The second experiment repeated the 
same experiment with inclusion of narrative oath in 
addition to apparent oath on the same dataset. The third 
experiment performed similar experiment but scoped to 
smaller dataset (Juz' 'Amma). 
The results of all experiments have led us to two main 
conclusions. First, machine learning algorithms perform 
better classification results in small dataset compare to 
large dataset. Second, IBK and Multilayer Perceptron 
classifiers performed better results compare to J48 and 
BN classifiers.
