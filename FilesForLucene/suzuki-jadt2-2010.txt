Abstract
Along with its methodological development, authorship analysis has expanded in scope to new application 
areas like authorship profiling and computational sociolinguistics as well as conventional ones like authorship 
attribution. For these new applications, providing a new interpretation of text through the textual characteristics is 
as important as improving the classification performance between the authors, which was the aim in conventional 
applications. Lexical indicators were one of the most frequently used characteristics in conventional applications 
as they were effective at discriminating between authors, but most of the previously used indicators were based on 
the frequencies of morphemes, and reflected only limited aspects of the writing styles of the authors. In order to use 
these types of characteristics for new applications, we need to develop indicators reflecting other various aspects 
of the authors’ writing styles that are useful for interpretation as well as classification. As such, we propose the use 
of two types of co-occurrence-based indicators, namely network indicators (L and C) and a co-occurrence-based 
concentration indicator (CoD) in this field. Experimental results using the Aozora Bunko corpora, along with 
qualitative analyses, showed that our indicators were very effective at capturing the new aspects of the styles of 
the authors as well as for improving the classification performance. We concluded that our indicators successfully 
supplement previously used indicators and are useful for various new applications in authorship analysis.

1. Introduction
Along with the methodological developments made in natural language processing, and the 
production of a wide variety of available texts, authorship analysis has expanded in scope to 
new application areas like authorship profiling and computational sociolinguistics as well as 
conventional ones like authorship attribution (Argamon et al., 2007; Suzuki, 2009). These new 
application areas aim at making inferences about authors’ personal or socio-cultural profiles 
on the basis of their writing styles, while the conventional areas aim at discriminating between 
authors (Argamon et al., 2007; Estival et al., 2007; Zheng et al., 2006).
For conventional applications, identifying the characteristics that are effective enough for 
dis-criminating between authors has been one of the most important goals, and many textual 
characteristics have been proposed for this purpose. Among them, lexical indicators have 
frequently been used as they reflected the information on the frequencies of morphemes, and 
thus were effective for improving the discriminant power between authors.
364 CO-OCCURRENCE-BASED INDICATORS FOR INVESTIGATING AUTHORS’ STYLES
JADT 2010: 10 th International Conference on Statistical Analysis of Textual Data
It is certain that these types of information are important for authorship analysis, but at the same 
time they reflected the limited aspects of the writing styles of the authors. For new applications, 
as they emphasize the interpretation of texts through the textual characteristics as well as the 
discrimination between authors (Suzuki, 2009), we need to develop new indicators that reflect 
other aspects concerning the authors’ writing styles.
As such, this study proposes the use of two types of indicators that are based on the co-occurrent 
combinations between morphemes, namely network indicators and a co-occurrent-based 
concentration indicator for the authorship analysis. We extract the co-occurrent combinations 
between morphemes in a sentence to create these two types of indicators, so that these indicators 
can shed light on the information concerning the relation between morphemes as well as the 
information on the syntax (or sentence); these types of characteristics are currently attracting the 
growing attention of scholars in related fields (Akama et al., 2008; Kim and Daelemans, 2008; 
Miyake and Joyce, 2007). These two different types of indicators are based on the co-occurrent 
combinations between morphemes, but have different emphatic points; network indicators 
reflect the global structure of the co-occurrence graph, and reflect the structural alignment of 
the morphemes in the texts, focusing more on the relation itself instead of the frequencies, while 
a co-occurrence-based concentration indicator is an extension of a concentration indicator, and 
focuses more on the frequencies 1. They should supplement the conventional lexical indicators 
based on the frequencies of morphemes, and should shed light on the new aspects of the writing 
styles of the authors. It should be noted that we deliberately examine the meaning of these 
indicators, i.e., what textual information these indicators use, by qualitatively analyzing the texts 
as well as comparing the improved performance of these indicators to several patterns within 
the experiments. We use the random forests classifier for comparing the importance between 
indicators, which has rarely been used but best suits our purposes. This study contributes to 
many new applications in authorship analysis, by proposing the indicators reflecting these new 
aspects of the writing styles of the authors.
2. Characteristics
In this section, we explain the four kinds of characteristics we use in this study: (a) frequency 
of morphemes; (b) basic indicators; (c) network indicators; and (d) co-occurrence-based in-
dicators 2. Of these characteristics, (a) is one of the simplest and most basic characteristics in 
authorship analysis (Stamatatos, 2009); (b) are the conventional lexical indicators based on the 
frequencies of the morphemes; and (c) and (d) are our proposed indicators 3 which are based 
on the co-occurrent combinations between the morphemes. The difference between (c) and 
(d) is that (c) takes in the global structure on co-occurrence graphs (Newman, 2003), while (d) 
neglects this point, but emphasizes more on the frequencies of the co-occurrent combinations.
2.1. Frequencies of morphemes
We used a bag of words model using the relative frequencies of uni-gram morphemes for set-
ting up the experimental baseline, and we increased the number of morphemes from the most 
 1 In other words, the former emphasized the structural characteristics made by co-occurrence graph, while the 
latter emphasized the distributional characteristics made by co-occurrent combinations.
 2 Both (c) and (d) are based on the co-occurrent combinations between morphemes, but for descriptive purposes, 
we name (d) the co-occurrence-based indicators below.
 3 More precisely, (c) are new indicators in this field (that means they have already been used in other fields like 
link analysis), while (d) have never been used in any field including authorship attribution.

frequent one to 100 morphemes. A bag of words clearly reflected the textual information of the 
frequencies of morphemes, and our indicators were based on all the morphemes as well, thus it 
is better for our baseline than other more complicated language models 4.
2.2. Basic indicators
We used Simpson’s concentration indicator D (Simpson, 1949) as a conventional indicator 
based on the frequency spectrum, i.e., the frequencies of all the morphemes, which is formalized 
as follows:
where N represents the number of tokens, i.e., the number of morphemes appearing in texts, 
V(N) represents the number of types, i.e., the number of different morphemes appearing in 
texts, and V(m, N) represents the number of types appearing m times in texts. D is an indicator 
that is strongly affected by the frequencies of frequent morphemes (Kageura, 2000). D is an 
invariant estimator of C0,2 (Good, 19�3) and is independent of N (Kageura, 2000; Tweedie and 
Baayen, 1998). For that reason, it is effective for discriminating between the authors of texts 
(Grieve, 2007; Hoover, 2003a; Jin and Murakami, 2003; Miranda Garcìa and Calle Martìn, 
2007). We also used N, V(N), a type-token ratio (TTR = V(N))/N), and the growth rate (GR = 
V(1, N)/N) in our experiments �.
2.3. Network indicators
We used the average path length (L) and cluster coefficient (C) as basic network indicators 
while taking in the global structure of the graph (Newman, 2003). For co-occurrence graphs, 
it should reflect the structural alignment of the morphemes in the texts. They are respectively 
formalized as follows:
where Ve represents the number of nodes, d(u, v) represents the minimum distance between 
two nodes, Ei represents the number of edges for the vertex i, and Cli represents the number 
of clusters for vertex i. L represents whether the two nodes in a graph are distant or not, and C 
represents whether the nodes in a graph are tightly-clustered or not. For a co-occurrence graph, 
L should reflect both the variety of morphemes and the complicatedness of the sentences. If an 
author uses similar morphemes in different sentences (or situations), L will be low, and if they 
use different morphemes in them, L will be high. In addition, if they use complicated sentences, 
 4 A bag of function words may improve the performance, but our main purpose is to examine what types of 
information these indicators use, instead of achieving its state-of-the art performance, thus a bag of words is 
better as a baseline. See also Section 3.3 regarding this point.
 � These indicators were not necessarily effective for discriminating between the authors of texts, but we used 
them in our experiments because we would like to compare the variable importance of these indicators to D. 
We also used these types of indicators for comparison regarding the network indicators and co-occurrence-
based indicators.

JADT 2010: 10 th International Conference on Statistical Analysis of Textual Data
L will be low, and if they use simple sentences, L will be high. C is a mean value of Ci for all 
the morphemes in the texts, and should reflect the authors’ preferences to general or special 
morphemes, as Ci is high for general or multisense morphemes and low for special morphemes 
including hapax legomena. Ci can also be used for detecting special hidden (infrequent, but 
important) keywords from the texts (Akama et al., 2007). By using these indicators, we can 
understand the structural alignment of morphemes and this will shed light on the stylistic 
character of the authors regarding their sentence structures as well as lexical choices. We used 
Ve, and the number of edges (E) in our experiments for comparison.
2.4. Co-occurrence-based indicators
Finally, we used a new indicator of co-occurrence-based concentration (CoD), which was for-
malized as follows:
where CoN represents the number of co-occurrent combinations appearing in texts (equals 
the sum of the weight of edges (w)), V(CoN) represents the number of different co-occurrent 
combinations appearing in texts (equals E), and V(w, CoN) represents the number of different 
co-occurrent combinations appearing w times (equals the number of edges with weight w). 
This indicator is an extension of Simpson’s D to co-occurrent combinations, and emphasizes 
the information on the frequencies of the frequent co-occurrent combinations. As we extract 
the co-occurrent combinations in a sentence, this indicator should reflect the information on 
the syntax as well as the relations between morphemes. This indicator shows an important 
characteristic of D, namely the sample size independency. We used CoN, V(CoN), the type-
token ratio of co-occurrent combinations (CoTTR = V(CoN)/CoN), and the growth rate of co-
occurrent combinations (CoGR = V(1, CoN)/CoN) in our experiments for comparison.
3. Experimental setup
In this section, we explain the data, methods, and experimental designs we used.
3.1. Data
We downloaded 200 texts by 10 Japanese novelists (20 texts per novelist) from the Aozora 
Bunko corpora 6 on 29 August 2008. The selection of texts was based on a previous study 
(Jin and Murakami, 2007) 7. We removed the headers, footers, readings, explanations, titles, 
chapter and section titles, and quotes, and then carried out morphological analysis using 
MeCab 8. Tab. 1 lists the basic data on the corpora. We extracted the co-occurrent combinations 
between morphemes in each sentence and made a co-occurrence graph for every text in which 
a morpheme is a node and a co-occurrent relation is an edge.

3.2. Machine learning methods
We used the random forests classifier proposed by Breiman (Breiman, 2001) as our classification 
method. We first replicated the text-feature matrix Mi,j 1000 times with replacements, and 
extracted random subsets of  variables from each replicated item of data. We constructed an 
unpruned decision tree for each sample using the Gini index formalized as follows:
where c represents the class and p(c | x) is the probability that the divided individuals (the texts) 
belong to the class in constructing a tree (Jin and Murakami, 2007). We constructed a new classifier 
by a majority vote of the set of trees. Two-thirds of the bootstrap samples were used for 
constructing the model and the other third were left out for testing the model (out-of-bag test).
We calculated the variable importance using the following formula (Breiman, 2001):
Coob: number of votes cast for correct class in out-of-bag data;
Cper: number of votes cast for correct class when m variables are randomly permuted in out-of-bag data;
s.e.: standard error.
The mean value of the subtractions for all the trees formulated above represents the variable 
importance of a permuted variable. It represents the degree to which a class loses its specific 
character when one type of morpheme changes into another type of morpheme. This method 
has advantages for our task, as our purpose is to compare the contributions of the indicators, 
rather than achieving the best performance. This method calculates important variables directly 
contributing to the classification in the experiment, thus it best suits our purposes.
3.3. Experimental design
We used a bag of words model using the relative frequencies of uni-gram morphemes as the 
baseline (Exp1). We increased the number of morphemes from the most frequent one to 100 
morphemes. We added previously used basic indicators to this baseline (Exp2), and our pro-posed 
indicators to them (Exp3), thus we performed three kinds of experiments, annotated as follows:
Exp1. bag of words (baseline);
Exp2. bag of words + basic indicators (D, N, V(N), TTR, GR);
Exp3. bag of words + basic indicators + network indicators (L, C, Ve, E) + co-occurrence-based indicators (CoD, 
CoN, V(CoN), CoTTR, CoGR).
We added the indicators to the baseline because it is more usual instead of using them alone 
for authorship analysis (Koppel et al., 2009). We confirmed the improved performances of 
each indicator and examined what types of information these indicators use by comparing the 
performances by increasing the number of morphemes in the baseline. In addition, we did 
not add any other characteristics like sentence length, character-based characteristics, etc. and 
deliberately observed the improved performance of these indicators because it forced us to 
examine these points more clearly 9.
 9 Thus it is not a conventional sense of baseline in information retrieval that usually means the state-of-the art.

JADT 2010: 10 th International Conference on Statistical Analysis of Textual Data
We evaluate the experimental performances using the macro average of the F1 values. Random 
forests use random numbers in the experiments, thus we performed the experiments 100 times, 
and calculated the mean F1 values for these 100 experiments (Jin and Murakami, 2007). We 
compared the performances for three types of experiments, and compared the contribution of 
our proposed indicators to the classification (shown as VIacu in random forests). As well as these 
quantitative evaluations, we also qualitatively evaluated the results; we discussed what types of 
textual information these indicators used by examining the actual texts with special values for 
these indicators.
4. Results
In this section, we show the results regarding the experimental performance and variable im-
portance.
Figure 1: Transitions in the macro average of F1 values in the three kinds of experiment
4.1. Experimental performance
Fig. 1 shows the transitions for the macro average of F1 values when the number of mor-phemes 
in the baseline increases from the most frequent one to 100 morphemes, regarding Exp1, Exp2, 
and Exp3. We used the Wilcoxon rank sum test to confirm the significant difference between 
Exp1 and Exp3, and Exp2 and Exp3 (using the most frequent one to 100 morphemes, and using 
the most frequent 20 to 100 morphemes). The results showed that Exp3 performed significantly 
better than Exp1 (p < .01) (both cases), and than Exp2 (p < .0�) (using the most frequent 20 to 
100 morphemes), while there was not significant difference (p = .12) between Exp2 and Exp3 
using the most frequent one to 100 morphemes.
These results are summarized as follows: (a) Exp3 was basically superior to Exp1 and Exp2; (b) 
when the number of morphemes in the baseline was small, Exp2 was superior to Exp3; and (c) 
Exp3 had the best and the most stable performance for more than 43 morphemes and performed 
the best with the most frequent 81 morphemes (F1 = 96.74).

4.2. Variable importance
Tab. 2 lists the variable importance (VIacu) of Exp2 and Exp3 with the most frequent 10 
morphemes (when Exp2 performs the best) and the most frequent 100 morphemes (when Exp3 
performs the best).
The results can be summarized as follows: (a) D has high VIacu among the basic indicators 
(both Exp2 and Exp3); (b) regarding the experiments using the most frequent 10 morphemes, a 
relatively large difference in VIacu of D was found between Exp2 and Exp3 (rank 4; value �.278 
vs. rank 8; value 3.203), while a relatively small difference was found between them regarding 
those using the most frequent 100 morphemes (rank 16; value 1.260 vs. rank 18; value 1.033); 
(c) L and C have a relatively high VIacu among the network indicators (Exp3); and (d) CoD 
has an especially high VIacu for all indicators, which means it is important for discriminating 
between authors (Exp3).

5. Discussion
In this section, we discuss the results. In Section �.1 and �.2, we discuss the results from our 
experimental performance, and we then discuss what information our proposed indicators used 
in the qualitative analyses in Section �.3.
5.1. Experimental performance
Regarding the experimental performance, the results showed that our indicators, namely, 
the network indicators and the co-occurrence-based concentration indicator, as well as the 
previ-ously used basic indicators, improved the performance. This implies that these kinds 
of indicators represent different types of textual information, and thus the proper use of these 
indicators will be effective in authorship discrimination.
Regarding the indicators, the results first confirmed the importance of D in authorship 
discrimination. D is an indicator that is independent of the sample size, namely, N (Tweedie 
and Baayen, 1998; Kageura, 2000; Yoshikane, 2000).
370 CO-OCCURRENCE-BASED INDICATORS FOR INVESTIGATING AUTHORS’ STYLES
JADT 2010: 10 th International Conference on Statistical Analysis of Textual Data
The results secondly show that the proposed indicator CoD is especially important for use 
in authorship discrimination. CoD is an extension of D, thus analytically independent of the 
sample size, namely, CoN. In addition, this indicator provides information on the co-occurrent 
combinations between morphemes. The results indicated that this indicator is very powerful for 
discriminating between the authors of texts.
The results also indicate that network indicators L and C are useful to some extent in authorship 
discrimination, but not so effective when compared to CoD. This is because these indicators are 
rather heavily dependent on the sample size, namely Ve, while CoD was constant to the CoN.
5.2. Comparison between Exp2 and Exp3
Regarding the experiments using the most frequent 10 morphemes, Exp2 performed better 
than Exp3. This was likely caused by the differences in the VIacu of D. In the experiments with 
the most frequent 10 morphemes, it was important to obtain information on the frequencies of 
rather frequent morphemes, namely those in the 11th place or lower in this case. D is an indicator 
that uses a great deal of information on the frequencies of frequent morphemes (Tweedie and 
Baayen, 1998; Kageura, 2000), and is able to use the information on these rather frequent 
morphemes. Exp2 used only the basic indicators, and for that reason, provided a high VIacu 
to D. In this way, it successfully provided information on the frequencies of rather frequent 
morphemes for classification, and thus performed better than Exp3. On the other hand, Exp3 
used network indicators and co-occurrence-based indicators as well as the basic indicators, and 
for that reason, Exp3 provided a lower VIacu to D. In this way, it failed to use the frequency 
information of rather frequent morphemes, and thus performed worse than Exp2.
Regarding the experiments using the most frequent 100 morphemes, Exp3 performed better 
than Exp2. This was likely caused by the fact that more information on the frequencies of 
morphemes was used in the baseline in this case, and thus resulted in a situation in which less 
information was available for D. The fact that fewer differences in the VIacu of D between Exp2 
and Exp3 were found when using the most frequent 100 morphemes corresponds to this point. 
The results indicate that, in such a situation, indicators like CoD that provide different types of 
textual information should be effective at discriminating between the authors of texts. The fact 
that Exp3 performed better than Exp2 with the most frequent 100 morphemes, and that CoD 
showed an especially high VIacu in this case corresponds to this point.
We conclude that the selection of indicators should be made in accordance with the particular 
situation: when the information on the frequencies of morphemes is insufficient, we should 
use indicators that provide this kind of information first, but when that kind of information has 
already been adequately obtained, we should use indicators that provide other types of textual 
information.
5.3. What information did these indicators use?
Our results showed that CoD was an especially important indicator for discriminating between 
authors of texts, thus in this subsection we first qualitatively discuss what types of textual in-
formation CoD used. CoD is an extension of D, and should reflect the information of frequent 
co-occurrent combinations. Thus, for examining what types of textual information CoD used, 
we need to focus on the frequent co-occurrent combinations. Tab. 3 lists pairs of morphemes, 
their parts-of-speech, and frequencies, of the 1� most frequent co-occurrent combinations of 
the text of ‘Kare (He)’ written by Akutagawa, which had the highest CoD value. Tab. 3 lists 
that frequent co-occurrent combinations of the texts including combinations of (a) particle and

particle, (b) particle and auxiliary verb, and (c) pronouns and auxiliary verb. The following is a 
sample sentence from this novel.

shite i-ta. (After leaving his uncle’s house, he rented a six-mat room on the second floor of a 
typesetting shop in Hongo.)
What CoD focused on was the combinations of the frequent function words, and our results 
showed that it reflected the authors’ syntactic styles of writing in Japanese, e.g., whether the 
author used subjective case (Kare wa) and objective case (ie wo) in the same sentence, or whether 
he or she used objective case (ie wo) and locative case (Hongo no) in the same sentence, etc. 
They reflected different information as the collocation of the texts, which, according to Hoover 
(2003b), co-occurrences in n word window in English reflected. In addition, they reflected 
completely different information that was given by bi-gram characteristics, frequently used 
in various NLP tasks including authorship analysis. Our methods, based on the frequent co-
occurrent combinations, captured the new aspects of the authors’ writing styles without any loss 
in high classification performance, and thus complemented the previously used indicators that 
reflected the frequencies of the morphemes. This indicator can be used for understanding any 
new aspects of the writing characteristics of the authors of the texts.
As L and C were affected as Ve and NoS, they were not so effective as CoD for discriminating 
between the authors, but the results indicate that it can clarify special characters of the authors 
of the texts. For example, a novel by Kikuchi (KIKU112) had an especially high L value in 
Fig. 2. Qualitative examination of this novel showed us that it included many conversational 
sentences. We removed these sentences, but the text still included many incomplete sentences 
like ‘he said’. This indicator can detect these types of texts, which can be used for interpreting 
the authors’ writing styles.
Qualitative examination of the texts showed that high Ci morphemes in fact included many 
function words, while low Ci morphemes included many hapax legomena. In addition, C also 
showed us the special characteristics of the texts regarding the sentences, for example, a novel 
by Dazai (DAZA192) had especially longer sentence lengths, and that can also be shown in 
the highest C value. For our purposes, these indicators did not improve the performance as

CoD, but our results implied that these indicators can show us new style of the author aspects, 
thus these indicators can be used for characterizing the texts, and can be useful in authorship 
analysis.
6. Conclusion
This study proposed the use of indicators based on the co-occurrent combinations between 
morphemes for use in authorship analysis. The results indicated that our indicators were effective 
for capturing the new aspects of the styles of the authors as well as for discriminating between 
them. We concluded that our proposed indicators successfully supplemented the information 
provided by the conventional lexical indicators based on the frequencies of the morphemes, and 
thus were effective enough for use with new applications in authorship analysis.
In the future, we will focus more on the use of network indicators like L and C. These indicators 
take into the global structure of a graph, and thus should have an important role in discriminating 
between the authors of texts. However, these indicators should depend significantly on the 
sample size Ve and the number of sentences NoS , and for these reasons, were not so effective 
in discriminating between authors as CoD in our experiments. We can improve these indicators 
regarding the sample size dependency, one possible approach would be applying Monte Carlo 
simulations to adjust the number of nodes. Another would be transforming these indicators 
analytically. We will investigate these points in future studies.
