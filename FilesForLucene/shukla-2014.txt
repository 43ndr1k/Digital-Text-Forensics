Abstract—In this paper we present an automatic genre-
based web page classification system for determining whether a 
web page contains an advertisement or not. Due to the 
difficulties and subjectivities in defining a genre, its features 
and their categorization, genre based classification is still 
rudimentary. In this research, we identified key features and 
used those features to define the advertisement category. We 
then developed a genre-based classification system to 
automatically classify a web page into advertisement category, 
which is important for commerce and for web users who prefer 
to either view or skip advertisements. We implemented and 
tested the proposed system, which achieved an average 
accuracy of 82%. Furthermore, we incorporated this system 
with other genre and subject based system to create a 
comprehensive web page classification system.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Over the past decades, there has been a tremendous 
growth in the internet and the World Wide Web. The web 
users have increased exponentially resulting in the extreme 
commercialization of the web. Presently, online advertising 
has been a major source of revenue for businesses. With the 
growth of advertisements on the web, came the stage of it’s 
over exploitation causing various problems to the users. 
Thus, classification of web pages into advertisement plays 
an important role, both, for users who are interested to view 
them, as well as for users who want to skip them. In this 
paper, we focus on classifying web pages into advertisement 
category.  
Thus, we created a genre-based classification system to 
automatically classify web pages into advertisement 
category. In general, there are two types of web page 
classification systems: the subject-based and the genre-
based systems. As the name suggests, in subject-based 
classification (also known as topic-based classification), 
web pages are classified according to their subjects or 
contents[1]-[5]Moreover, genre-based classification 
system[6]-[10]focus mainly on the structure or format of the 
document, the purpose of the web page, and the intended 
audience, which are collectively called as the genre related 
factors. 
Genre based classifications are sporadically used, the 
main reason being that the genre of the Web pages is highly 
subjective. Divergence in comprehension of the genre of a 
Web page makes it challenging for an investigator to 
classify it into the correct genre. Typical viable concepts for 
genre–based classification are unsatisfactory to befit the

search requirements of the user and are therefore still under 
development. An exemplification being [6], where only 
three categories are defined, making it complicated for users 
to determine an appropriate category for exacting their 
search requirements. While [10] concentrates primarily on 
organizational member’s communication actions like the 
business or technical report. This approach is impertinent to 
cater every user’s needs. 
This paper defines ―genre‖ as the web page’s functional 
purpose provided to web users. Advertisement is the content 
of web pages whose purpose is to publish information for an 
advertiser and help attract consumers and increase 
productivity. The notion behind defining genre in this way is 
that we care about users’ multi-facet search demands for the 
web pages.  
Based upon the demands from businesses to identify 
advertisements, in this paper we focus on creating a genre-
based classification system to automatically classify web 
pages into advertisement category. We extracted new key 
features from web pages and used those features to define 
the category. The entire feature set will be introduced in 
detail in Section III. In addition, we proposed new process 
to associate features to the category. For the results, we 
demonstrate our proposed system achieving an average 
classification accuracy of 82%, which ascertains that our 
system is viable and forms the background for future 
research.  
Creating an advertisement category proves itself to be a 
challenging research problem. Prior works on subject-based 
[4] and in genre-based systems [11] have not addressed this 
issue. The two types of classification systems are presently 
not able to process the picture content on web pages, 
however many advertisements consist of pictures only. 
Thus, the classification systems, including the one proposed 
in this paper, have an equal likelihood of categorizing such 
web pages as advertisements. We also perceive that it is 
difficult to separate a product review from an advertisement, 
since both of which contain similar information about the 
product. The work presented in this paper forms an initial 
attempt to address these research problems and much 
research remain to be done.  
The rest of this paper is organized into the following 
sections. Section II outlines the related research. Section III 
provides details of our genre classification system for 
advertisement, which provides methods for feature 
extraction from web pages, methods for association of 
features to the category, and methods for genre classification 
of web pages. Section IV provides implementation and test 
results. Finally, Section V gives the conclusion and outlines 
the future research.  
 
II. RELATED RESEARCH 
To identify the genre of a Web page, its structural 
information can play a key role. The Web pages having a

―common feature‖ are classified into the respective 
category. The features affecting the structure include but are 
not limited to textual features, such as the number and 
placement of links and logos, image features, such as the 
distinct colors of the image, and other features, such as a 
flash video or other multimedia contents[6].Research in 
[6]uses a structure based approach which consists of only 
three categories defined in the paper: information pages, 
research pages, and personal home pages. The technique in 
[12] is profoundly similar to [6], both classify Web pages 
are according to their structural characteristics. The 
categories in [12] are online shopping, product catalog, 
advertisement; call for paper, links, frequently asked 
questions, glossary, home page, and bulletin board. The 
features used in the paper include URL, keyword, image, 
link, OCR, structure, and plug in [12].  
Conjointly, another denomination of genre used is the 
communicative actions of Web pages. Paper [10] defines 
genre as “a type of communication recognized and enacted 
by organizational members”. They presented six questions: 
why(purpose of communicative action),what(contents of a 
genre or genre system),who/whom(participants in genre or 
genre system),when(timing of genre or genre system 
use),where (place of communicative action),and how (the 
form of genre and genre system)[10].  They describe a 
category by answering these questions. 
In [7], a genre is defined in terms of dimensions such as 
the degree of expertise, the amount of detail presented and 
whether it reports facts and/or opinions. The expertise 
dimension is estimated as a function of the frequency and 
length of words in the document [7]. The estimation of 
detailed dimension is performed as a function of the 
document’s physical size, number of lines, and the 
frequency of long words [7]. Superficial linguistic features 
such as the part-of-speech tags are used to determine the 
subjective dimension. When users care about the degree of 
expertise, these dimension shave proved to be very 
advantageous. 
Furthermore, some hybrid techniques have also been 
developed that conjoin multiple concepts. For instance, 
[13]classifies Web pages based upon the characteristics such 
as purpose or function of the page, its intended audience, its 
surface content or format (e.g. words, tables, sounds, tools, 
etc.), the type of links it contains, and its relationship to the 
pages to which it provides the links (e.g. cover page, index, 
etc.) [13].The categories defined in the paper accommodate 
organizational pages, documentation, text, homepage, 
multimedia, database entry, and tools. 
 
III. OUR GENRE CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM FOR 
ADVERTISEMENT 
Internet and the World Wide Web are emerging and ever-
expanding fields aiding immediate publishing of content 
through Online Advertising from any part of the world to 
the other in virtually no time. It has proved to be an effective 
source to bring in customers for the advertisers in the recent 
past. On the other hand, it has also provided the authority to 
the Web users to examine the advertisement or product or 
not. The function of an online advertisement is very clear- to 
show product to consumer, ask them if they want to check 
out the product further, provide them more information (if 
unless desired) and to let them place the order if they desire. 
Though advertisements come in disparate formats, to 
achieve all the functions, typical online advertisement 
consists of several common properties. For instance, many 
of them may have price information and clickable images or 
flash videos which can link to a specific product page; some 
advertisements may be contained within pictures with no 
textual information. There frequently exist some clickable 
buttons which enables the users to be redirected to another 
website that provides more information about the product in 
the advertisement. We utilize these common traits to 
distinguish a normal Web page from one with 
advertisements. 
In this section, we propose a new classification system 
based on web page genre and focused on advertisement 
category. We define features that are to be extracted from 
Web pages. Then, we describe how to use these features to 
specify the advertisement category. We finally describe how 
to assign a category to a Web page.  
A. Feature Extraction from Web Pages 
In order to extract features pertaining to online 
advertisements from Web pages to identify the category, we 
analyze not only the contents of the Web pages, but also the 
URLs, HTML tags, Java scripts, and VB scripts. The 
principles used to select features include, but are not limited 
to: (1) The features should positively contribute to the 
classifier model. (2) The features should be detectable; (3) 
The computational cost of detecting each feature should be 
modest. (4)The features should follow the idea of Web page 
genre classification, and not involve the features that used 
for subject-based approach. This principle proves to be more 
favorable when we combine the concepts of genre 
classification with subject-based approach.

feature set by gathering hundreds of Web pages of discrete 
categories and analyzing the HTML files, and the embedded 
scripts. We developed the model and extracted28 features as 
provided in Table I, the details of which will be provided in 
the following subsections.  
B. Association of Features to the Category 
To build a classification model for genre-based system, 
we first need to determine how to specify each category 
using the given features. There are two major stages: (1) 
estimation of feature weights and and (2) fine tuning the 
feature weights that define the category. 
 
 
Fig. 1. Estimation of feature weights 
 
The first stage consists of finding the approximate value 
of parameters including feature weights. The process in this 
stage is shown in Fig. 1. First, the URLs of the Web pages 
to be used as the training dataset are selected and stored in a 
file. Then we download the HTML code for the Web page 
from the URL content. The HTML files are then passed 
through a HTML feature extraction module, by which each 
feature’s occurrence frequency in each category is 
calculated. The initial value of the feature weight in the 
advertisement category was defined by the frequency of 
occurrence of the feature in that category. The formula to 
calculate the initial weights is: 
 
𝑊𝑒𝑖𝑔𝑕𝑡 𝐶𝑖  , 𝐹𝑖 =
 2 × 𝐹𝑟𝑒𝑞  𝐶𝑖  , 𝐹𝑖 − 𝑁  𝐶𝑖  
𝑁 𝐶𝑖  
 
 
 Weight (Ci, Fj) is the feature Fj’sweight in category Ci. 
 Freq (Ci, Fj) is the occurrence frequency of the feature Fj 
in the category Ci. 
 N (Ci) is the number of Web pages of category Ci in the 
training set. 
The fine tuning of the initial values of threshold and 
features weights produced from the first stage is performed 
to associate features to the category of advertisements. Fig. 
2 shows the process. The URLs of Web pages in training 
dataset are first provided to both the Web page HTML 
download module and the feature extraction module. The 
Web page download module takes the URL and downloads 
the HTML file and then passes the file to a HTML feature 
extraction module, which analyzes HTML file and detects 
the frequencies of occurrence of each feature. The HTML 
feature frequencies are then passed through the sum 
generation module, which receives the feature weights 
corresponding to the advertisement category. Two tasks are 
performed in this module- to calculate the sums of the 
feature weights in each category, and to transmit it to the 
result processing module. In the course of result processing, 
the data is normalized, and is compared to the normalized 
score to the threshold. If the score is not higher the 
threshold, then the Web page will be considered not 
belonging advertisement categories and labeled as ―other‖; 
otherwise the page will be classified to the advertisement 
category.  
 
 
Fig. 2. Fine tuning feature weights and threshold 
 
We then evaluate the final classifier performance and 
adjust the threshold and features weights to optimize the 
classification system. The weights initially are all ranging 
from 0 to 1.For the fine tuning, we choose one key feature 
from each category and increase the weight to 0.2. This is 
based on an assumption that most of the categories have 
their unique feature that may represent themselves best and 
distinguish from other categories. Then we ran the 
classification system on the training dataset to check the 
likely value. The classification results were checked, and the 
errors were analyzed and used as the feedback to modify the 
weights again. It is necessary to repeat the whole fine tuning 
process many times in order to achieve the best 
performance. The resulting weights for one our experiments 
are shown in Table I.  
Besides fine tuning the feature weights, we also need to 
fine tune the threshold, which is used to distinguish whether 
a Web page belongs to the defined genre categories or not. 
The value of the threshold is very important since it will 
significantly influence the performance of the classification 
system. We use the precision, recall, and F-measure to 
describe the performance [4]: 
 
𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 =
𝑎
𝑎 + 𝑏
 
 
𝑅𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 =
𝑎
𝑎 + 𝑐
 
 
a: the number of testing examples correctly assigned to

incorrectly rejected to the category 
 
𝐹 = 2 ×
𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 × 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛
𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑎𝑙𝑙 + 𝑝𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑖𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛
 
 
For our experiments, when the value of the threshold

increases, the precision will increase, but the recall will 
decrease. To keep a balance between the precision and 
recall, the threshold cannot be too high or too low. F-
measure combines precision and recall, and allow us to keep 
a balance between them by adjusting the threshold to 
maximize the value of F-measure. For our training dataset, 
the best performance happens when the threshold is set to 
0.55, using whichthe average of the F-measure is high, and 
the distributing of the F-measure does not result in any 
category having a significantly low F-measure. 
C. Genre Classification of Web Pages 
After features are associated to the advertisement 
category and the feature weights and the threshold are fine-
tuned, our system presents itself to be equipped to classify 
new Web pages. The classification process is shown in Fig. 
3. This process is similar to the fine tuning process except 
we do not modify the weights and the threshold. The URL 
of the Web page to be classified is first given. The features 
of the Web page is extracted and weighted. The total weight 
for each category is calculated and the highest one is 
selected. The highest weight is then normalized by the size 
of the HTML file of the Web page. If this normalized 
weight is larger than the threshold, then the Web page is 
classified to the category that has the high weight; otherwise 
it is considered not belonging to any defined genre 
categories.

IV. IMPLEMENTATION AND TEST RESULTS 
We implemented and tested our proposed genre-based 
classification system for advertisement using Mathematica. 
First, we collected a set of training web pages from the 
Internet. These training web pages represent a diversify 
ranges of web pages that contain advertisements. We 
analyzed the training web pages in details, and extracted 28 
key features that signify advertisements.  
Having the set of features, we then create a feature vector 
that defines the advertisement category. This is done by (1) 
retrieve all HTML codes of the training web page, for which 
we use the Mathematica function: Import[url, ―Source‖]. (2) 
We analyzed the HTML codes to determine the feature 
counts, for which we use the following Mathematica code: 
𝑆𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑛𝑔𝐶𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡[𝑕𝑡𝑚𝑙, #, 𝐼𝑔𝑛𝑜𝑟𝑒𝐶𝑎𝑠𝑒 
−> 𝑇𝑟𝑢𝑒]&/@𝑓𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑠 
 
where, ―html‖ is the codes for one of the training web pages, 
―features‖ is a set of 28 search key (see Table 1). The above 
code creates a feature vector for a training web page. After 
processing feature vectors for all the training web pages, we 
then normalized all the vectors to create a single feature 
vector that represent the advertisement category.  
During the training process, a weight vector is created and 
multiplied with the feature vector to create a weighted 
feature vector, which represent the advertisement category 
as the result of fine turning the weight vector, as introduced 
in the last section. The resultant weight vector is show in the 
―Weights‖ column in Table 1. 
During our testing, we collected a new set of web pages 
of diversify subjects. For each of the test web pages, we 
generated a test feature vector using the Mathematica code 
as discussed above. This test feature vector is compared 
with the weighted feature vector of the category using the 
cosine similarity measure, which is defined as:  
 
cosSim ≔ Function[{𝑢, 𝑣}, 
 
 (𝑢[[𝑖]] × 𝑣[[𝑖]]) (  (𝑢[[𝑖]])^2
28
𝑖=1
×   (𝑣[[𝑖]])^2
28
𝑖=1
) 
28
𝑖=1
] 
 
If the value of the cosine similarity is greater than a 
predefined threshold, then the corresponding test web page 
is classified into the category. The threshold is determined 
(as discussed in the last section) during the training process 
and is 0.55 for our experiments.  
The classification result for each test web page is checked 
by visiting the web page to verify its contents. The overall 
result of our test can be summarized as achieving an average 
accuracy of 82%. Pertaining to the results, we formulate the 
conclusion that the proposed approach is viable and has a 
scope for future developments.  
 
V. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE RESEARCH 
This paper proposes a new automatic genre-based web 
page classification system, which focuses on the 
advertisement category. New features to identify 
advertisement web page and new methods to define the 
category are introduced. The proposed system can achieve 
reasonable average classification accuracy, which provides 
the groundwork for future research. We incorporated this 
system with our other genre [11] and subject based [1]-
[5]system to create a comprehensive web page classification 
system[2], [4], [14].  
To achieve the high accuracy, the system currently 
requires considerable manual fine tuning of the feature 
weights and the threshold during the training phase. Since 
the web is dynamically changing, new features will emerge 
and need to be identified. When new features are added into 
the system, in addition to determining the weights of the 
new features, the existing feature weights and the threshold 
should also be modified. To keep up the changes, future 
research should seek to develop more automated training 
and fine tuning process.

To achieve better accuracy for classifying web page 
containing advertisements, future research should address 
the problem of processing the contents of pictures 
incorporating pattern recognition, since numerous 
advertisements are contained within pictures.
