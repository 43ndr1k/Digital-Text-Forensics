Abstract
The Quranic oath is God’s emphasizing the importance or truthfulness of a
concept. Oaths are multifaceted, rich expressions, in which a single oath contains
a line of meaning and a variety of aspects. This study proposes a new stylometric
model for detecting apparent and narrative oaths. Toward this end, two types of
application-specific features from a stylometric perspective—structural and con-
tent-specific features—were examined. The stylometric features were extracted,
and a Bayesian network was constructed to model such features. The stylometric
model of oaths was then evaluated through a series of machine-learning experi-
ments using various classifiers: the Bayesian network, a decision tree, instance-
based learning, and a neural network. These classification experiments focused on
applying stylometric features in apparent and narrative oaths. The experiments
covered two datasets: the entire Quran and the smaller dataset of Juz’ ‘Amma.
The results led to two main conclusions. First, stylometric application-specific
features are best used in their entirety—both structural-based and content-spe-
cific—rather than as two separate entities. Second, applying stylometric features
was more significant in Juz’ ‘Amma, in which 40% of its surahs (chapters) con-
tain oath statements. Finally, the stylometric model was extended for oath styles
detection using three additional stylometric features—syntactic, character, and
lexical, and it was analyzed using statistical approach.

1 Introduction
An oath (qasam) is defined as a solemn appeal to a
deity to attest the truth of a statement. This is the
verb aqsam or uqsim (‘swear’) in Arabic ( )
(Muhammad, 1997), used to distinguish right
from wrong (Hassan, 2003). The use of an oath is
a common practice across many cultures and has
been part of law-related procedures for many cen-
turies. The essence of an oath is honoring that
which is sworn upon or worshipped, which in
Islam is exclusive to Allah (i.e., God) alone.
However, during pre-Islamic times, the oath was
commonly applied to objects that were gigantic in
size and brought immense benefit to humankind,
such as the Earth, the sun, and the moon (Al-
Kasani, 1986).
In English translations of the Holy Quran, such
as in Abdel Haleem (2005) and Hilali and Khan
(2007), the commonest rendering of the word
uqsim is ‘by God’ or ‘by Allah’, whereby the word
‘by’ represents the phrase ‘as surely as I believe in’

(Philips, 2005). Some Muslim scholars take the view
that the word rabb (‘God’) has been omitted from
this phrase; hence, the verses ‘by the sun’, ‘by the
moon’, and ‘by the fig and the olive’ should actually
be ‘by the Lord of the sun’, ‘by the Lord of the
moon’, and ‘by the Lord of the fig and olive’. The
oath is significant in the Quran because it describes
the greatness of God, as in verse 56:76 of surah ‘That
Which Is Coming’ (Al-Waqi’a), which is translated
as ‘a mighty oath, if you only knew’.
1.1 Oath statement structure
The Quranic oath is an expression used in the verse
to describe a true condition and its consequent
effect. This oath emphasizes the importance or
truthfulness of a concept as revealed in the verse.
The syntactic structure of the Quranic oath in gen-
eral consists of two statements. For example, in the
oath ‘I swear by God, such and such will occur’, the
first statement is called the oath statement; it con-
tains a verb or a noun that directly indicates the
‘swearing’ action—a character b ‘ ’ to mean ‘by’
and the object of ‘God’. The second statement is
called the oath answer statement or the effect of
such oath. In some studies, the term ‘oath state-
ment’ refers to the first statement (Hassan, 2003;
Rajab, 2009); in others, it refers to the verb and
object (Ibrahim, 2009).
An oath statement may be in the form of a noun
expression, such as the phrase l‘amr’u’k’ (Rajab,
2009), which means ‘upon your life’ (Hashmi,
2008). In this oath, Allah is swearing by the
Prophet Mohammed’s life or age, which is a com-
bination of an oath and its object. In addition, not
only does this statement lack an oath verb, it also
does not use an oath character (Ibrahim, 2009). An
oath statement may additionally be referred to as a
verbal expression—a statement where the oath verb
(the swearing), oath character (the word ‘by’), and
oath object (God or creations) exist (Hassan, 2003;
Rajab, 2009). In general, Quranic oaths are one of
two types. The first type is a direct-speech oath, in
which God swears by His essence or by His creations
(Hassan, 2003). The second type is when the oath
appears in descriptive stories or human narratives.
Figure 1 shows the classification of Quranic oaths
and oath-like expressions.
1.2 Oath classification
Based on the classification in Figure 1, if the oath
statement exists in a direct speech by Allah it is
known as an apparent oath (Hassan, 2003). For ex-
ample, verse 4:65 in surah ‘Women’ (Al-Nisa’) is
translated as ‘By your Lord, they will not be true
believers until they let you decide between them in
all matters of dispute, and find no resistance in their
souls to your decisions, accepting them totally.’ An
apparent oath is an oath said as an expression
( ), and God swears using His essence
(dhāt’u’Allah) or His creations as the oath object
(Hassan, 2003). According to Saad et al. (2010),
an oath-like expression uses either the character w
‘ ’ or the verb lā uqsim.
Apparent oaths are generally rich in style. One
stylistic example is the use of more than one oath in
a surah signified by the use of an oath character. For
instance in surah ‘The Sun’ (Al-Shams) verses 91:1
to 91:7 are translated as ‘By the sun in its morning
brightness, and by the moon as it follows it, by the
day as it displays the sun’s glory, and by the night as
it conceals it, by the sky and how He built it, and by
the earth and how He spread it, by the soul and how
He formed it.’ Another example is the use of a nega-
tive clause preceding the verb, as in surah ‘The City’
(Al-Balad) verse 90:1, which is translated as ‘I swear
by this city’. In addition, there is the use of different
classes of objects, such as the sun [surah ‘The Sun’
(Al-Shams) verse 91:1] and the moon [surah ‘The
Sun’ (Al-Shams) verse 91:2].
If the oath contains a verb, or if the oath object
comes with an oath verb, the character has to be b
‘ ’ (Rajab, 2009; Ibrahim, 2009). In some cases, the
oath may be preceded by the negative particle lā,
which means no. The negative lā precedes the
oath in eight places in the Quran (Hashmi, 2008;
Ibrahim, 2009). Examples of this are seen in the
following: in surah ‘Shrouded in Darkness’ (Al-
Takwir) verse 81:15, ‘I swear by the planets’; surah
‘Ripped Apart’ (Al-Inshiqaq) verse 84:16, ‘I swear by
the glow of sunset’; and surah ‘The City’ (Al-Balad)
verse 90:1, ‘I swear by this city’. [In the Arabic text
of the Quran, the negatively phrased oath appears as
‘I don’t swear by’, but the translation ‘I swear by’ is
based on the actual meaning (tafsı̄r), which is ‘I
swear by’.] However, as noted above, oath

statements are not always represented in conjunc-
tion with the oath indicator or verb. Instead, the
verses start with what is called the oath character
followed by a noun expression. For example, in
surah ‘The Declining Day’ (Al-Asr) verse 103:1,
the oath is in the form of character ‘by’, as in the
translation ‘By the declining day’.
In contrast to apparent oaths, if the oath state-
ment is hidden in a direct-speech oath taking by
Allah, it is known as a hidden oath (Hassan,
2003). This is the case when the oath character,
oath verb, and oath object do not exist—only the
oath answer statement (Hassan, 2003; Rajab, 2009).
Because the b ‘ ’ character is the origin of oath
characters, if another oath character is used, the
oath statement is deleted (Rajab, 2009). For ex-
ample, verse 96:15 in surah ‘The Clinging Form’
(Al-Alaq) is translated as ‘No! If he does not stop,
We shall drag him by his forehead.’ As the focus
of the present study is oath statements in particular,
hidden oaths are beyond the scope of this research.
From Figure 1, a secondary classification of oaths
and oath-like expressions is the narrative oath,
which is an oath made by God in the form of a
narrative taken from old stories (Hassan, 2003).
Hassan (2003) described two cases of narrative
oaths. The first case is similar to that of the general
oath syntax: the oath verb, character b ‘ ’, and
object exist. This is seen in surah ‘Livestock’ (Al-
Anam) verse 6:109, which is translated as ‘They
swear by God with their most solemn oaths that if
a miraculous sign came to them they would believe
in it. Say [Prophet], ‘‘Signs are in the power of God
alone.’’ What will make you [believers] realize that
even if a sign came to them they still would not
believe?’ The second case is the particular use of
the t ‘ ’ character, as in surah ‘The Prophets’ (Al-
Anbiya) verse 21:57 (Hassan, 2003), which is trans-
lated as ‘By God [Allah] I shall certainly plot against
your idols as soon as you have turned your backs!’;
this is used only when the oath object is ‘Allah’ and
for no others (Ibrahim 2009).
1.3 Oath characters and objects
Among oath characters, Ibn Ya’eesh (2001) specifies
b ‘ ’, t ‘ ’, and w ‘ ’ as oath characters in the
Quran. However, the usage of the oath characters
b ‘ ’, t ‘ ’, and w ‘ ’ varies from one verse to
another. The b ‘ ’ character is the origin of oath
characters and is usually joined by an oath verb

(Rajab, 2009). For example, verse 90:01 in surah
‘The City’ (Al-Balad) is translated as ‘I swear by
this city’. The t ‘ ’ character is used only when
the oath object is ‘Allah’ (Ibrahim, 2009; Rajab,
2009); for example, in surah ‘Joseph’ (Yusuf) verse
12:73, which is translated as ‘They said, ‘‘By God
[Allah]! You must know that we did not come to
make mischief in your land: we are no thieves.’’’
From this observation, the b ‘ ’ character is de-
pendent on the existence of an oath verb, whereas
the t ‘ ’ character is dependent on the oath object,
which is ‘Allah’. However, the third oath character,
w ‘ ’, is independent from the oath verb and certain
oath objects; hence, it is a particular challenge be-
cause w ‘ ’ is simultaneously a consonant and a
vowel. It also represents the conjunction ‘and’ in
English, and it is widely used in Arabic (Sayoud,
2012). The w ‘ ’ character could also appear as an
alternative to the oath verb in an oath expression
(Saad et al., 2010). Owing to the frequent use of w
‘ ’ in Arabic, an oath consisting of the verb and
oath character b ‘ ’ is replaced by w ‘ ’ (Ibrahim,
2009).
Research has also shown that the w ‘ ’ character
is used when the oath object exists without the oath
verb (Rajab, 2009); for example, in surah ‘The
Forceful Chargers’ (Al-Naziat) verse 79:1 is trans-
lated as ‘By the forceful chargers’. Another instance
is in surah ‘Women’ (Al-Nisa’) verse 4:65, which is
translated as ‘By your Lord, they will not be true
believers until they let you decide between them in
all matters of dispute, and find no resistance in their
souls to your decisions, accepting them totally.’ In
the Quranic Corpus Treebank, morphological ana-
lysis shows that w ‘ ’ is an oath character, but there
is no indication as to which type of oath is taking
place (Dukes et al., 2010).
With regard to the oath object, in apparent oaths
Allah swears by His essence or by His creations
(Hassan, 2003; Ibrahim, 2009; Rajab, 2009). The
use of God’s essence as the oath object is used in
five places in the entire Quran (Hassan, 2003); for
example, in surah ‘The Ways of Ascent’ (Al-Maarij)
verse 70:40, which is translated as ‘and, by the Lord
of every sunrise and sunset, We have the power.’
The majority of oath objects are natural creations
and universal phenomena (Ibrahim, 2009). Single
items are also used as oath objects, such as a pen
(Hashmi, 2008). In narrative oaths, the oath object
used is ‘Allah’ because it is expressed as a human
taking an oath.
The Quranic oath has been widely studied from a
theoretical basis in Islamic studies (Hassan, 2003;
Hashmi, 2008; Ibrahim, 2009; Rajab, 2009).
However, it has not been studied from a computa-
tional or stylometric perspective. The present
study proposes a new stylometric model for iden-
tifying apparent oaths and narrative oaths. In doing
this, two types of application-specific features are
investigated from a stylometric perspective: struc-
tural and content-specific features (Stamatatos,
2009).
 Structural feature analysis: at the head of a
surah with a special starting bigram. Oaths are
used whenever God intends to embellish the start
of a surah with imagery (Hashmi, 2008), such as
the literary opening in surah ‘The Charging
Steeds’ (Al-‘Adiyat) verse 100:1, which is trans-
lated as ‘By the charging steeds that pant’
(Ibrahim, 2009). In the present study, the use
of special starting bigrams is proposed as a struc-
tural feature. This term refers to the head of a
surah, such as verse 1 or verse 2, if the surah
begins with a special character that points to
oath without swearing verb. The feature of spe-
cial ending bigrams has been used for authorship
attribution between the Quran and Hadith
(Sayoud, 2012).
 Content-specific feature analysis. On some
rare occasions, oaths also occur in the middle
of surahs (Hashmi, 2008). Therefore, the strategy
in using the head of the surah and its remaining
parts is stylometric application of content-
specific features toward detecting apparent
oaths, oath-like expressions, and narrative oaths.
2 Related Work Using Stylometric
Analysis
Stylometry studies linguistic style in a written text.
Holmes (1994) defines style as a set of patterns that
can be measured and may be unique to an author;
hence, style markers are used to measure writing
A. Alqurneh et al.

style (Stamatatos, 2009). Whitelaw and Argamon
(2004) views writing style as an aspect of a text’s
meaning that is mostly independent of what the
text refers to in the world. Writing style refers to
linguistic choices made by an author that distin-
guish their writings from those of other authors—
even when the content is similar (Uzuner and Katz,
2005). The term also refers to a subtle disparity
among texts that may otherwise have language,
genre, and topic features in common (Golcher,
2007).
The computational system modules in stylomet-
ric analysis involve extracting style markers or stylo-
metric features and classifying the text according to
those features (Stamatatos et al. 2000). Stylometric
features are classified into five categories: lexical,
character, syntactic, semantic, and application-spe-
cific features (Stamatatos, 2009). Popular lexical
style markers or stylometric lexical features used in
various studies are vocabulary richness (Holmes,
1992, 1994), such as hapax legomena (Holmes,
1992; Stamatatos, 2009), and token-based features,
such as word length and sentence length
(Stamatatos, 2009).
Works in stylometric analysis or computational
stylistics (Oakes, 2004) focus on two main areas:
authorship attribution and text genre detection
(Stamatatos et al., 2000). Argamon (2007) defines
authorship attribution as the problem of determin-
ing the writer of an anonymous text that surfaced in
old literary works on unknown authors (Stamatatos,
2008). In short, authorship attribution involves
proving the authorship of unknown or disputed
texts (Stamatatos et al., 2000) by extracting and
identifying stylistic features in the writing that
reveal specific traits of an author, thereby distin-
guishing that author’s particular writing style
(Holmes, 1994). It is evident from studies in this
area that an analysis of authorship attribution in-
volves answering literary questions on unknown
texts (Houvardas and Stamatatos, 2006), and the
method applied may include forensics (Krsul and
Spafford, 1997), age and gender information
(Koppel et al., 2003), and other aspects related to
disputed authorship (Foster, 1999).
One of the most popular examples here is study-
ing the Book of Mormon (Holmes, 1992). In this
case, Joseph Smith claimed that he translated the
prophet’s golden plates, and Holmes (1992) used a
multivariate method containing stylometric features
of five vocabulary-richness functions to disprove
Smith’s claims. Another typical model is the case
of the Federalist Papers, whose 12 papers were
claimed to have been written by Alexander
Hamilton and James Madison. Stylometric analysis
using function words, such as prepositions, con-
junctions, and articles as discriminators, revealed
that the papers were authored by Madison alone
(Mosteller and Wallace, 1984; Holmes and
Forsyth, 1995; Oakes, 2004).
Genres are defined as a group of explicit events
with shared explicit objectives, and their measure-
ment varies according to how they represent an
object from a particular category (Swales, 1990;
Wolters and Mathias, 1999). Genre is also defined
as the total characteristics observed in a text that
gives it a unique print (Simaki et al., 2012). In styl-
ometry, text genre detection concerns identifying
the kind of text (Stamatatos et al., 2000) based on
its similar feature characteristics with other texts.
Researchers in text genre detection study different
types of genres within the same language or across
different languages (Karlgren and Cutting, 1994; Lee
and Myaeng, 2004). The domain of text also in-
cludes the Web genre (Stein and Eissen, 2006;
Boldrini et al., 2009), folklore and narratives
(Nguyen et al., 2012), poetry (Kaplan and Blei,
2007; Kao and Jurafsky, 2012), music (Bellaachia
and Jimenez, 2009), scientific articles (Bergsma et
al., 2012), and religious texts (Holmes, 1992),
including the Quran (Sharaf and Atwell, 2009;
Dukes et al., 2010; Nassourou, 2011b; Sadeghi,
2011; Sharaf and Eric, 2011; Sayoud, 2012).
Arabic texts have been widely studied from the
perspective of linguistic analysis (Habash and
Rambow, 2005), such as in noun generation
(Habash and Rambow, 2005), local accent gener-
ation (Habash et al., 2005; Altantawy et al., 2010),
verb classification (Snider and Diab, 2006), seman-
tic concept search (Al-Muhtaseb et al., 2009), text
classification (Khreisat, 2006; Sanan et al., 2008;
Ahmed and Nürnberger, 2011; Hattab, 2012), and
critiques (Alotaiby et al., 2011). Stylometric features
used in previous studies include token-based

(Snider and Diab, 2006; Altantawy et al.,
2010), character-based (Al-Muhtaseb et al., 2009),
and character-based n-gram features (Khreisat,
2006). Analyses performed on stylometric fea-
tures have used a statistical approach, such as n-
gram frequency in Khreisat (2006), and a ma-
chine-learning approach, like the Bayes classifier in
Hattab (2012).
With regard to the Quranic text, the Holy Quran
is written in classical Arabic. The Quran is an elo-
quent religious text by Allah in an exquisite literary
style that structurally resembles poetry (Zaghouani
et al., 2012). It belongs to a unique genre through
two elements: rhetoric and cohesiveness (Abdul-
Raof, 2003). The text consists of 114 surahs of vary-
ing lengths (Al-Taani and Al-Gharaibeh, 2010).
Computational work on the Quranic text has
included a study in determining the effectiveness
of verse retrieval (Al-Taani and Al-Gharaibeh,
2010), categorizing the Quranic parts as those re-
vealed in Mecca or Medina (Nassourou, 2011b;
Sharaf and Eric, 2011), and classifying the Quran’s
chronology (Nassourou, 2011a; Sadeghi, 2011).
Studies by Aldhaln and Zeki (2012), Jbara (2010),
and Alkhatib (2010) are directly related to text clas-
sification of the Hadith.
With respect to stylometric features in computa-
tional studies of the Quranic text, Thabet (2005)
used the feature of lexical frequency to study the
relationship among the surahs. In more recent
work, Sharaf and Eric (2011) and Nassourou
(2011a, b) used token-based features, such as word
frequency and sentence frequency with a machine-
language classification technique, like the naive
Bayes, to classify the Quranic chapters. Sadeghi
(2011) used lexical features for token-based meas-
urements, such as the average verse length and func-
tion words, as well as vocabulary-richness
measurements, such as words occurring once
(hapax legomena), to study the chronology of the
Quranic text. In his work, Sadeghi also used the w
‘ ’ character along with other common func-
tion words (morphemes) in the Quran to measure
the similarity among surahs, but he carefully
treated w ‘ ’ as a conjunction character. Similarly,
Sayoud (2012) used the w ‘ ’ character as both a
discriminative and a conjunction character in his
discriminative study between Quranic and Hadith
texts.
3 Stylometric Model for Oath
Expression Detection
Saad et al. (2010) showed that oath-like expressions
may begin with the oath character w ‘ ’ or the
phrase lā uqsim (‘indeed I swear’). Meanwhile,
Hassan (2003) and Rajab (2009) discussed the
object in oath statements and concluded that such
nouns normally refer to God’s essence, a creation, or
a universal phenomenon (Ibrahim, 2009). For ex-
ample, in the translation of verse 103:1 mentioned
in section 1.2, the noun is Al-Asr, and it refers to a
phenomenon, which is ‘the declining day’. An add-
itional characteristic of an oath-like expression is
that it might also appear with its continuous oath
conjunction. An example of this is seen in Juz’
‘Amma, which is the last part of the Quran (part
number 30): it contains 37 surahs, beginning with
surah number 78, ‘The Announcement’ (Al-Naba’),
and ending with surah number 114, ‘People’ (Al-
Nas); its surahs are primarily focused on the oneness
of Allah, the day of judgment, and the afterlife
(Rajab, 2009). An oath conjunction is an oath-like
expression that follows a first oath-like expression,
though the conjunction character used in the above
verses is not considered an oath character.
Some studies (Hassan, 2003; Hashmi, 2008;
Ibrahim, 2009) have classified Quranic oaths based
on the oath taker and oath objects. In an apparent
oath, oath taking is done by Allah, and the verse
refers directly to an object, which is either God’s
essence (dhāt’u’ Allah) or His creations. In the pre-
sent study, a special starting bigram at the head of a
surah is proposed to differentiate apparent oaths
starting with w ‘ ’ as well as a number of content-
specific keywords that are related to oath objects,
such as rabb, and negative clauses, like lā uqsim.
Stamatatos (2009) proposed using stylometric
features, consisting of application-specific structural
features together with content-specific keywords, to
detect any kind of oath. Application-specific fea-
tures are important because they are applicable to
any language, including oriental languages. As

shown in Figure 2, structural features will be based
on the head of the surah containing a special start-
ing bigram or keywords, and content-specific key-
words will be based on particular keywords. In the
case of an apparent oath, the keyword to the phrases
containing rabb in the five places mentioned by
Hassan (2003) was related to phrases containing lā
uqsim, whereby the oath verb ‘swear’ (uqsim) is pre-
ceded by the negative word lā. In the case of a nar-
rative oath, the keyword to the phrases ‘aqsam’ū
b’iAllah’i jahd’a ayman’ihim and ‘t-Allah’i
(Hassan, 2003) was related.
Table 1 presents the details of apparent and nar-
rative oaths investigated in the present study to-
gether with their dependencies. Table 2 shows
sample features that were extracted from the first
verses of each surah in Juz’ ‘Amma.
3.1 Bayesian network model for oaths
A Bayesian network is a graphic model for probabil-
istic relationships among a set of features.
Specifically, each node in the graph represents a
variable, while the edges between the nodes repre-
sent probabilistic dependencies among the corres-
ponding variables. The network structure is in the
form of a directed acyclic graph (DAG), and it en-
ables effective representation and computation of
the joint probability distribution (JPD) over a set
of variables.
In oath detection, it is important to determine
whether a verse is a structural-based oath or con-
tent-specific-based oath, such that P (oath type |
verse) is the highest. To model the Bayesian net-
work, all verses from the 114 surahs in the Quran
were selected. The Quran contains a total of 6,236
verses (ayat) from surah ‘The Opening’ (Al-Fatiha)
(surah number 1) to surah ‘People’ (Al-Nas) (surah
number 114) of varying length. For the structural-
based oath model, 114 instances from the entire
Quran were examined. For the content-specific
oath model, 6,236 instances from the entire Quran
were investigated.

The structure of a DAG in a Bayesian network is
defined by a set of nodes and a set of directed edges.
The nodes represent the oath features extracted
from the Quranic verses and are drawn as circles
labeled with the variable names. The edges represent
direct dependence among the variables and are
drawn as arrows between the nodes. Table 3 shows
the choice of nodes to represent the oath features for
the Bayesian model.
Figure 3 illustrates a sample of the network top-
ology for oath and oath-like expressions based on
application-specific features in stylometry, which
are structural-based and content-specific.
In addition to the DAG structure, it is necessary
to specify the parameter of the model, which is the
conditional probability distribution (CPD) at each
node. In this regard, the maximum likelihood esti-
mation is used to assess the following conditional
independencies:
PðX1; :::;XnÞ ¼
Yn
i¼1
PðXijPaðXiÞÞ
A Bayesian network model encodes the JPDs for
all nodes by multiplying the CPDs at each node in
the network. Tables 4 and 5 show the joint prob-
abilities for the proposed structural-based and con-
tent-specific features, respectively.
From the Bayesian network model, we observed
that the inference for structural-based oaths gave the
probability of PðSOT jPA2Þ ¼ 0:18 for the special
starting bigram and the probability of the keyword
as head as PðSOT jPA5Þ ¼ 0:017. In addition, the
keyword features for apparent and narrative oaths
gave the probability of PðCOT jCS1Þ ¼ 0:0017 and
PðCOT jCS2Þ ¼ 0:0020, respectively.
3.2 Extension to statistical model
Following oath topic detection using the applica-
tion-specific features—structural and content-spe-
cific—the proposed Bayesian network model was
then extended to include statistical analysis to cap-
ture styles in oaths as opposed to the types of oath
in the Bayesian network-only model. This led to
new stylometric features, thereby allowing a deeper
linguistic analysis of the oath styles. In addition to
the application-specific features, the present study
extended to syntactic, character, and lexical levels,
thereby including other stylometric features, such as
rewrite rule frequencies (syntactic), bigrams and tri-
grams (characters), and token-based, vocabulary
richness as well as frequent function words (lexical).
These stylometric features have been successfully
employed in stylometry (Stamatatos, 2009).
In the subsequent experimental analysis, each pro-
posed stylometry feature has a specific objective or
objectives. Syntactic features are based on the Arabic
Treebank and applied in providing the characteristic
information for each component of the oath state-
ment (e.g. prepositions, verbs, nouns). The second
feature used is the character n-gram feature, particu-
larly the character trigram. In detecting oath types, it
is proposed that this feature handle one-word oaths

where no oath verb (swearing verb) exists. For oaths
that consist of a preposition and one noun word, this
feature will detect a one-word oath based on a special
starting trigram. Moreover, the bigram was also used
to detect other oaths, such as the lā uqsimu keyword,
where the bigram lā frequently begins with this key-
word. Therefore, bigrams and trigrams are used to
detect a special starting of the oath statement—either
in a one-word oath, which contains no swearing
verb, or a keyword oath. Finally, lexical features are
used in evaluating the extracted components from
the oath statement based on such measurements as
the following: number of words (oath objects); the
occurrence once or twice; frequent function words,
e.g. prepositions (oath characters), nouns (oath
objects), and verbs (swearing verbs); and word
(oath object) lengths. The set of lexical features is
useful because it can indicate the exact differences
between oath types (styles) and differentiate the
oath styles of the oath takers.
The evaluation of oath statement components
shows the stylistic characteristic of each oath type,
which will help in differentiating the oath takers
(Allah versus narrative). Usually, certain authors
have sharable writing styles in their writings; how-
ever, in the case of oath statements sworn by Allah
almighty, the oath styles are rich and uniquely dif-
ferent. This is the reverse of the case with the nar-
rative oath, which uses a common oath object
(Allah). From this point of view, it is evident that

the syntax for narrative oaths, such as general oaths,
is similar to that used in classical Arabic because
humans should use only the object of God (Allah)
in their oaths. However, oaths sworn by Allah pos-
sess fewer sharing properties in terms of style, which
underlines the divine power and the uniqueness of
oath expressions.
These stylometry features—particularly character
n-gram—are useful in comparing structural oaths in
the Quran and structural oaths in classical Arabic

text, such as Jahili (pre-Islamic period) poetry,
where the poems often start with an oath.
4 Experiments of Oath Expression
Detection
Detection of an oath statement by humans may be
applicable when the oath statement contains a
swearing verb as the main keyword. However, as
described above, oath types in the Quran may
occur without a swearing verb, in particular when
the oath starts with the character ‘w’, which makes it
difficult to identify the oath. Therefore, in the first
stage of this research, a machine-learning approach
to oath detection is presented based on the pro-
posed stylometric application-specific feature
model. This approach covers three classification ex-
periments using structural and content-specific oath
features with four classifiers: Bayesian network, de-
cision tree, instance-based learning, and neural net-
work. Later, a new set of experiments based on
statistical analysis using further stylometric features
(syntactic, character, and lexical) will be added. The
datasets used are as follows:
 In the first experiment, the dataset includes only
the apparent oath, which signifies oaths that use
creation or rabb as the oath object (the head
starts with ‘w’, the keywords ‘lā uqsim’, or con-
tains ‘rabb’). Classification is performed first on
the verses using the structural features alone and
then the content-specific features (keyword).
 The second experiment is similar to the first ex-
periment with the additional two cases of narra-
tive oaths (‘aqsam’ū b’iAllah’’’, ‘t-Allah’i’).
 The third experiment is a repetition of the pre-
vious experiments specifically for Juz’ ‘Amma, as
opposed to the global text in the Quran.
 Structural features are used to detect the oath
statement that occurs at the head of the surah.
Therefore, if an oath is detected at the head of a
surah, it is a structural oath; the content-specific
feature is used to detect an oath statement key-
word that occurs elsewhere in the surah. In that
case, the oath is the keyword.
 In addition to the machine-language approach,
the statistical analysis for the next proposed
stylometric features (syntactic, character, and
lexical) is carried out. This kind of analysis will
show the difference between oath styles, which
will lead to the recognition of oath takers in
the Quran based on the stylistic characteristic
of the oath styles.
The main objective of the classification experi-
ments is to evaluate the proposed application-
specific oath features extracted from the Quranic
verses. To do this, three evaluation measures—
precision, recall, and F-measure—were used as the
basis for the comparison between Bayesian networks
and other machine-learning algorithms. To control
for biasness, 10-fold cross-validation (Kohavi, 1995)
was applied to divide the Quran text into 10 ap-
proximately equal partitions: this provided a train-
ing and testing set, with each partition being used in
turn for testing and the remainder being used for
training purposes.
4.1 Experiments on apparent oaths
In the following experiments, the first 114 verses
from the 114 surahs were considered for struc-
tural-based features, and 6,236 verses from the 114
surahs of the Quran were examined for content-
based features.
4.1.1 First experiment: structural-based features
In this experiment, all the first verses have to be
classified as structural type if the oath statement is
detected at the head of the surah. The classification
results are presented in Table 6. This experiment
employed structural-based features in stylometry
with a Bayesian network, J48, IBK, and multilayer
perceptron. The results showed that the structural
features from the 114 verses were able to detect only
two apparent oaths at the head of surahs, which are
‘w’ and ‘lā uqsim’, with the absence of the ‘rabb’
keyword. The classifiers successfully detected verses
whether an oath existed or not. Detecting only two
oaths at the head of the surah bounded the struc-
tural feature to obtain the same result as that in
Table 6. Therefore, another experiment for the
second stylometric feature, which is content-spe-
cific, is required to detect an oath elsewhere in the
surah.

4.1.2 Second experiment: content-specific
features
In this experiment, all the verses will be classified as
content-specific type if a keyword occurs in the
middle or end parts of the surah using content-
specific stylometric features. The classification
results appear in Table 7. The measurements of pre-
cision, recall, and F-measure showed that the clas-
sifiers IBK and multilayer perceptron gave better
results than Bayesian network and J48.
4.2 Experiments on apparent and
narrative oaths
In the following experiments, the first 114 verses
from the 114 surahs were considered for the struc-
tural-based features, and 6,236 verses from the 114
surahs of the Quran were investigated for content-
based features.
4.2.1 First experiment: structural-based features
In this experiment, any of the 114 first verses is
classified as structural type if the oath statement is
detected at the head of the surah, as the structural
feature refers to the starting position of the oath at
the head of the surah. The classification results are
presented in Table 8. This experiment employed
structural-based features in stylometry with a
Bayesian network, J48, IBK, and multilayer percep-
tron. The results showed that the structural feature
from the 114 verses was insufficient to explore all
types of oaths because it detected one type only.
Hence, another experiment for the second stylomet-
ric feature is required, which is content-specific. It is
notable that this experiment produced a similar
result to that in Table 6 for the following reasons:
first, it detected the same apparent oaths as in the
experiment in Section 4.1.1; second, there was a lack
of any narrative oath keywords at the head of the
surahs. Therefore, the experiments showed similar
results.
4.2.2 Second experiment: content-specific
features
In this experiment, any verse is classified as content-
specific type if a keyword occurs in the middle or
end parts of the surah using the content-specific
features in stylometry. The classification results
appear in Table 9. The measurements of precision,
recall, and F-measure showed that the classifiers IBK

and multilayer perceptron gave better results than
Bayesian network and J48.
The modest results from Tables 6 to 9 are mainly
attributed to the fact that our proposed application-
specific oath feature model produced approximately
45 instances out of 6,236 instances from the entire
Quran dataset. Therefore, the application-specific
features should be investigated in a smaller dataset.
For this purpose, we chose Juz’ ‘Amma (part 30)
from the Quran for the third experiment. This is
justified by the finding that oaths are found in
more than 40% of the surahs in this juz’ (Rajab,
2009); hence, it is a fertile environment to perform
the classification experiments.
4.3 Experiments on Juz’ ‘Amma
From the previous series of experiments, it was
found that the false class was larger than the true
class. Therefore, experiments on Juz’ ‘Amma were
conducted because it is considered a balanced data-
set: oaths are found in more than 40% of its surahs
(Rajab, 2009). In the following experiments, for
structural-based features, we considered the
first 37 verses from the 37 surahs; for content-
based features, we considered the 564 verses from
the 37 surahs of the Quran for stylometric feature
analysis.
4.3.1 First experiment: structural-based features
In this experiment, all the first verses will be classi-
fied as structural type if an oath statement is de-
tected at the head of the surah. The classification
results appear in Table 10. This experiment em-
ployed structural-based features in stylometry with
Bayesian network, J48, IBK, and multilayer percep-
tron. The results show that the precision and F-
measure measurements in J48, IBK, and multilayer
perceptron gave better results than the Bayesian
network.
4.3.2 Second experiment: content-specific
features
In this experiment, all the 564 verses will be classi-
fied as content-specific type if a keyword occurs in
the middle or end parts of the surah using content-
specific features in stylometry. The classification re-
sults are presented in Table 11, which shows that
none of the chosen classifiers produced acceptable
results with this stylometric feature.

4.4 Statistical approach analysis
The proposed application-specific features were
used in the previous experiments to detect oaths
using a machine-language approach; however, add-
itional proposed stylometric features are necessary
to examine the oath styles. The objective of this
analysis is to investigate each style toward obtaining
the characteristic of oath styles in the Quran, which
can lead to distinguishing the oath takers. From
this analysis, the following findings represent a con-
tribution to the body of knowledge:
 The analysis on the value in oath objects using
the stylometric approach sheds new light on the
argumentative discussion of object importance
(i.e. glory) among previous Islamic scholars
(Hashmi, 2008).
 Using a stylometric approach to classify the oath
objects in oaths sworn by Allah produces com-
parable results to the classification in Islamic re-
search studies (Hassan, 2003).
 Stylometry distinguishes oath styles based on
stylistic characteristics, which assists in differen-
tiating the different oath takers.
Syntactic analysis is based on a rewrite-rule fre-
quency feature. Using this feature, we can obtain the
morphological meaning of oath components. This
analysis is useful for the stylometric lexical features,
where this information will be used in evaluating the
different oath types. Rewrite-rule frequencies are
shown in Table 12.
Character n-gram features are proposed to com-
plement and ensure the success of the objective of
application-specific features (structural features),

which detect one-word oaths that appear at the head
of the surahs (‘w’ character-based oath) using a
character trigram (a word-starting trigram). This
procedure was able to detect the starting trigram
opening of the one-word oath by finding the prep-
osition ‘w’ and definite article ‘al’, which occur as ‘w
al’ ( ). In addition to using the trigram with ‘w’
oath types, character bigrams (starting bigrams)
were applied to detect the lā uqsim oath type. The
results are shown in Tables 13 and 14.
Lexical feature analysis was used to evaluate each
oath style and find the differences that allow the
oath takers to be identified. The measurements
used include vocabulary richness, the hapax lego-
mena function (words occurring once in the
Quran), short objects, and length of the oath
object. Tables 15–17 show samples of the analysis
obtained using lexical features, where the oaths
sworn by Allah (w, lā uqsim, rabb) have richer styl-
istic characteristics than narrative oaths (‘aqsam’ū
b’iAllah’I’, ‘t-Allah’i’).
From the stylometric feature analysis using the
statistical approach, the following can be concluded.
First, there is no glory in the actual meaning of the
oath objects used in the oaths sworn by Allah, but
these objects are unique in their form because they
are used by Allah Almighty. Second, many objects in
oaths sworn by Allah are found to satisfy vocabu-
lary-richness features because they appear only once
in the Quran, such as ‘asr, dhāriyĀt, and shafaq, or
they appear twice, such as qalam. Most of them also
use short words and have different object lengths.
The token-based and vocabulary-richness features
are confined to the oath styles where Allah is the
oath taker as opposed to the narrative-oath cases,
which use the term ‘Allah’ as an oath object. Finally,
stylometric analysis on the different oath styles
allows the oath takers to be distinguished. Oaths
sworn by Allah are rich in style, feature vocabulary
richness, and have more exclamation style than nar-
rative oaths.
5 Discussion and Conclusion
This paper proposes a stylometric model for oath
and oath-like expressions using application-specific
features from the Quran, which includes apparent
oaths and two cases of narrative oaths. The justifi-
cation for analyzing oath and oath-like expressions
using stylometry is that only in this way can the
essence of the writing style for oaths in the
Quranic text be captured and quantified. We ex-
tracted stylometric features from oath statements
without oath conjunctions following the oath state-
ment. Next, a Bayesian network was employed to
model structural-based and content-specific oath
features. In evaluating the stylometric feature
model, three series of experiments were designed
and conducted. The first series consisted of three
experiments to detect apparent oaths using stylo-
metric application features: structural, content-
specific, and both. The second series repeated
those experiments but with the inclusion of

narrative oaths as well as apparent oaths. The third
series of experiments performed similar experiments
but focused only on Juz’ ‘Amma.
The results of the three experiments were largely
twofold. First, stylometric application-specific fea-
tures are best used in their entirety—both for struc-
tural-based and content-specific features—rather
than as two separate entities. Second, applying stylo-
metric features was more significant for Juz’ ‘Amma,
where oath statements are found in over 40% of its
surahs (Rajab, 2009). Stylometric application fea-
tures thus need to be improved for an appropriate
examination of oath styles. A lexical approach is an
obvious procedure for stylistic investigation, and in
the form of computed concordances more data exist
at the lexical level than at any other (Holmes, 1994).
Therefore, the stylometric model proposed in the
present study should be extended to include syntac-
tic (rewrite-rule frequencies), character (bigrams
and trigrams), and lexical features, such as token-
based features and vocabulary-richness features
(Holmes, 1992, 1994; Stamatatos, 2009). This will
result in statistical analysis rather than the proposed
classification-based machine-learning approach.

Though the machine-learning approach was used
detect oath topics in this study, a statistical ap-
proach should be used for investigating oath styles.
The major contribution of this study is using
stylometric features to examine oath statements,
starting with oath statement detection using appli-
cation-specific features. Though application-specific
features are effective only in oath statement detec-
tion, other stylometric features, such as character
and lexical features, can be used to examine the
characteristics of oath statement styles. Evaluating
different oath statement styles using lexical feature
analysis with the information on characteristics pro-
vided by syntactic feature analysis assists in distin-
guishing oath takers. Similarly, the character n-gram
feature is able to ensure detection of one-word oaths
without the swearing verb.
