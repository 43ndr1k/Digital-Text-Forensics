Abstract: The exceptionality of shape and style of authors can be used for author’s identification. The 
goalmouth of authorship attribution is to identify a set of features that remain relatively constant among a 
number of writings by a particular author. This paper deals with text author identification problem using 
character n-grams. However, the commonly usage is total n-gram for identification purpose but we consider 
all types of n-grams e.g. initial, medial, final and total bi-grams and tri-grams. Experiments show that author 
profiles generated with initial bi-gram and initial tri-gram are effective in identifying texts authors in 
comparison with other n-gram profiles. The results disclosed in this paper leads to approximate 100 % 
accuracy in identifying the author from unknown text. 
 
Keywords: Author Identification, Character N-gram, Dissimilarity Measure 
 
1. Introduction  
The traditional methodology in authorship attribution employs differences and likenesses to establish the 
linguistic profile of the author behind the curtain. Stylometry is one of the basics for author exploration, 
which estimates writing physiognomies to draw implications about who is the true author of unknown text. 
Authorship attribution is a growing scientific field. This task is about either identifying the author of a text 
between a list of candidate authors, or verifying if a specific author did or did not write the text. In both cases, 
one of the main concerns is the search for quantifiable features that are able to differentiate between authors. 
Many types of features have been investigated including various measures of vocabulary richness and 
function word frequencies [2]. It has various applications like Disputed authorship literature, Software 
forensic (Virus authorship, source code plagiarism), civil law, criminal law [1]. 
The concept of N-grams was first introduced in Shannon's seminal paper on Information Theory [10]. An 
N-gram is a token consisting of a series of characters or words. N-gram approach is a encouraging alternative 
manuscript representation system for stylistic purposes. It has been shown that sub-word units as character n-
gram can be very effective for capturing the distinctions of an author’s style. Furthermore, n-gram author’s 
profile has been motivated and implemented by numerous researchers. Keselj et al [3] presented an 
automated Type Style and Fonts authorship attribution based on byte n-gram profiles. The approach is tested 
on three different languages: English, Greek and Chinese. Houvardas and Stamatatos [2] suggested a feature 
selection method for variable length n-grams. Raza et al [4] applied word n-gram based authorship 
attribution method to Urdu poetry. An experiment in trivial set of authors shows their affirmation using 
modern machine learning methods [5]. Ashwin Mohan et al [6] explored the idea of identification of authors 
based on SMS messages from effective gram size and similarity scoring method. Stamatatos et al [7] and 
Amasyali and Diri [8] used character n-gram in text categorization. Stamatatos [9] proposed method for 
intrinsic plagiarism detection using character n-gram profiles. 
In this paper we explore character n-gram based author’s profile. We have studied total bi-gram and tri-
gram; then we expanded our studies to initial, medial and final bi-grams and tri-grams which have not yet 
come into our picture so far. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II describes our approach. 
Section III explains our experimental results along with discussion. Finally section IV contains conclusion 
and future work.

Our approach is based on character bi-gram and tri-gram. We investigated character n-gram and subsets 
of n-grams; the initial, medial and final n-grams. Digits and punctuation marks are removed. The profile is 
defined as a set of length L of the most frequent n-grams with their normalized frequencies. An author (i) 
profile is generated from a training author text. The n-gram profile of the text document to be classified 
(manuscript profile) is compared with the profile of the corresponding author (i). The comparison is 
performed based on the dissimilarity measure algorithm [3]. In this algorithm, we generate the bi- and tri-
grams from author’s training sample text. A similar profile is generated for the test data. Let f1 (n) be the 
frequency of the nth bi- or tri-grams in the Author’s Profile. Let f2 (n) be the frequency of the nth bi- or tri-
grams in the test data. The dissimilarity between the two profiles is calculated using the following formula: 
∑ (f1(n) – f2(n) )2            (1) 
   
In order to normalize these differences, we divide them by the average frequency for a given n-gram 
Sum =   ∑                         (2) 
Sum =   ∑                   (3) 
 
In the analysis phase, we find the value of dissimilarity measure of all training data set and the testing text 
and store in database of dissimilarity measure as shown in Fig. 1.

Identification PROCESS: FOR A NEW TEXT (NEW DOCUMENT) THE PROFILE IS GENERATED AND 
DISSIMILARITY WITH THE AUTHOR PROFILE IS CALCULATED. CHECK THE VALUE OF DISSIMILARITY WITH THE 
DISSIMILARITY VALUE OF EXISTING AUTHORS (I), WHICHEVER IS CLOSE TO THE DISSIMILAIRTY VALUE OF 
UNKNOWN TEXT. THEN IT CAN BE SAID THAT THE NEW TEXT IS IDENTIFIED BY THE AUTHOR (I). IF NOT, THE 
NEW TEXT BELONGS TO ANOTHER AUTHOR NOT IN DATABASE (FIG. 2).  
3. Experimental Results and Discussion 
We considered English data set "A" including four authors: Eva Gale, Ruth Ann Nordin, Ross Beckmann, 
and Payton Lee (Table 1). Authors’ profiles are obtained using training texts. In bi-gram, we used profile size 
L= 100, 200 & 430 and for tri-gram we take profile size of 100, 200, 400 & 700.

Total N-gram: 
Results obtained for total bi-gram and tri-gram show that there is no appropriate threshold, which can be 
used to verify THE author. Table 2 and Table 3 show the results for author identification using the 
dissimilarity value obtained from analysis phase.

Initial N-gram: 
Table 4 gives the results for testing on initial bigrams. It shows the  profile size 430 for initial bi-gram has 
the dissimilarity for the same author texts is near to the dissimilarity for existing authors, which gives a 100% 
identification ratio. Results for testing on initial tri-gram (Table 5) how that both profiles 500 and 700 can be 
used to identify the author.

Medial and Final N-grams: 
The experiments results for medial and final bi-grams (Table 6 and Table 7) and for medial and final tri-
grams (Table 8 and Table 9) are not encouraging. There are overlaps between the dissimilarities for the same 
author and others. We decided not to perform further experiments on these bi and tri-grams.

Enlarged Corpus  
For more testing and analysis, we enlarged our corpus with other group of authors (Data Set “B”): Austin 
Jane, Dickens Charles, Bronte Anne, and Bronte Charlotte (Table 10). First, we tested the new data set for

initial bi-grams and tri-grams. The results are shown in Table 11 and Table 12. Then we tested the data set for 
the eight authors (both data sets A and B combined) only for initial bi- and tri-grams (Table 13 and Table 14).

After combining both the data sets “A & B”, the accuracy shows in Table 13 and Table 14.

Experiments results are quite good; the initial bi-gram gives high identification accuracy with profile size 
200 in initial bi-gram and so did initial tri-gram with the profile size 200,500 & 700 for all authors.  
4. Conclusion & Future Work 
In this paper we presented character n-gram based author identification approach. Total bi-grams and tri-
gram, initial bi-gram and tri-gram, medial and final bi-grams and tri-grams are investigated. Results obtained 
for total bi-gram and tri-gram were not encouraging, in opposite to result for initial bi-gram and tri-gram 
where an accurate author identification rates were obtained. Our results showed nearly 100% accuracy level to 
identify a mysterious text i.e. predict the most likely author of a text between a predefined set of candidate 
authors. In future work, we are intending to perform experiments on multi languages.
