ABSTRACT
This article provides a century-wide quantitative analysis of the Turkish literature using
40 novels of 40 authors. We divide the century into four eras or quarter-centuries; allocate
10 novels to each era, and partition each novel into equal-sized blocks. Using cross-
validation-based discriminant analysis, with the most frequent words as discriminators,
we achieve a classification rate with a relatively high accuracy when the novel blocks are
classified according to their eras. We show that, by using statistical stylistic methods, the
author gender of Turkish texts can be accurately identified. We also study the gender
differences regarding the use of most frequent words. Using weighted least squares
regression and a sliding window approach we show that as time passes, words, both in
terms of tokens (in text) and types (in vocabulary), have become longer. The findings of
this work have implications for the historical linguistic analysis of the Turkish language.
1. INTRODUCTION
In quantitative natural language analysis, stylometric studies aim to
discover hidden patterns or habits that are unconsciously used by authors
(Stamatatos et al., 2000; Hoover, 2008). Such statistical stylistic methods
are used in different fields that involve other kinds of human artefacts, such
as architecture (Ozkar & Lefford, 2006), music (Backer & van Kranenburg,
2005), painting (Johnson et al., 2008), and programming (Ding &
Samadzadeh, 2004). In stylistic text analyses, statistical methods employing

measurable text attributes (or style markers) – such as ‘‘most frequent
words’’, ‘‘sentence lengths’’, and ‘‘word lengths’’ – are used (Forsyth &
Holmes, 1996). The discovered hidden patterns, which conceptually
correspond to fingerprints of authors, are used for various tasks such as
authorship attribution (Smalheiser & Torvik, 2009), distinguishing works
from each other according to intended audience (Binongo, 1994), genre
detection (Kanaris & Stamatatos, 2009), author gender identification
(Koppel et al., 2002), finding the chronological order of works (Stamou,
2007), or identifying an author’s literary style development (Juola, 2007).
In this study we provide a quantitative analysis of the 20th-century
Turkish literature using 40 novels of 40 different authors. We use an
experimental approach aimed at quantifying patterns in the 20th-century
Turkish literature and language in terms of various aspects of word
usage. We investigate if author gender can be identified by their word
usage patterns and quantify different aspects of the diachronic language
change as time passes. To the best of our knowledge this is the only
quantitative language analysis study that covers a full century.
In our analysis we divide the century into four eras or quarter-centuries,
and include the full texts of 10 novels from each era. The reason for dividing
the 100 years into four 25-year eras is that it provides a good framework for
looking at temporal changes over time. It helps to eliminate variation
between authors when we calculate the average of a style marker for each
era. In our analysis we use six style markers: ‘‘most frequent words’’,
‘‘sentence length in terms of words’’, ‘‘syllable counts in tokens’’, ‘‘syllable
count in types’’, ‘‘token length’’, and ‘‘type length’’. We identify the gender
of the author of a given text using discriminant analysis. As suggested by
Koppel et al. (2002) the problems we attack, i.e. era- and gender-based
classifications, are more difficult than typical categorization and stylometry
problems, since ‘‘individual authors aremore likely tohave consistenthabits
of style than are large classes of authors’’. We investigate the change in
Turkish in terms ofword lengths and the use of themost frequentwords and
(arguably) claim that language change may affect authors’ word choices.
The findings of this work have implications for the historical linguistic
analysis of the Turkish language. Its main contributions can be
summarized as follows: in this paper we

show that they can be successfully achieved by using some
commonly-used style markers;

Turkish in the 20th century;
. show that word length change may affect authors’ common word
choices.
2. RELATED WORK
In stylometry studies, writing styles of authors are analysed using
objective measures. For this purpose about 1000 style markers have been
identified (Rudman, 1998). The occurrence patterns of the selected style
markers are used in various stylometric problems ranging from author-
ship attribution to gender detection. Similarly, the text categorization
methods aim to assign texts into predefined categories such as known
authors (Sebastiani, 2002).
A detailed overview of the stylometry studies in literature within a
historical perspective is provided by Holmes (1994). It gives a critical
review of numerous style markers and examines works on the statistical
analysis of change of style with time. A critique of many authorship
studies is provided by Rudman (1998). Stamou (2007) provides a survey
of stylochronometric approaches of the last 60 years used for stylistic
development analysis. Juola (2006) and Stamatatos (2009) provide a
review of types of analysis, features, and recent developments in
authorship attribution studies.
For analysing the occurrence patterns of style markers, various
statistical methods are used. One popular technique is principal
component analysis (PCA) (Binongo & Smith, 1999). Later in this work
we use this statistical technique to visualize the separation between the
works of the four eras. Another statistical technique we use in this study
is discriminant analysis. Holmes and Forsyth (1995) use discriminant
analysis to determine which vocabulary richness measures best dis-
criminated between the Federalist papers written by Alexander Hamilton
and those by James Madison. A similar work is undertaken by
Bagavandas and Manimannan (2008) using canonical discriminant
analysis to analyse three authors of Tamil language and show that their
styles are clearly distinguishable from each other. Koppel et al. (2002)

exploit combinations of simple lexical and syntactic features to detect the
gender of the author of a formal written text with about 80% accuracy.
They use the same techniques to determine if a document is fiction or not
with about 98% accuracy. Machine learning methods are also used in
stylometric studies. For example, Koppel et al. (2009) study the cases that
can occur in real-life authorship attribution applications. They define
possible problems and show how machine learning techniques can be
adapted to handle the special challenges of these problematic cases.
There are some Turkish-related recent works in the literature. For
example, the writing style change of two Turkish authors, Yaşar Kemal
and Çetin Altan, in their old and new works is analysed by Can and
Patton (2004). In a more recent study, they analyse Yaşar Kemal’s _Ince
Memed tetralogy using six style markers and provide accurate
categorization results in discriminant analysis (Patton & Can, 2004).
Kucukyilmaz et al. (2008) attack the categorization problem by using
various machine learning algorithms for analysing Turkish chats in the
Internet environment.
3. EXPERIMENTAL ENVIRONMENT
3.1 Turkish Language
In this study, by ‘‘Turkish’’ we mean the language mainly used in the
republic of Turkey. Turkish belongs to the Altaic branch of the Ural-
Altaic family of languages. Some concerns about this classification can be
seen in Lewis (1988). The Turkish alphabet is based on Latin characters
and has 29 letters consisting of 8 vowels and 21 consonants: a, b, c, ç, d, e
f, g, g, h, ı, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, ö, p, r, s, ş, t, u, ü, v, y, z. In some words
borrowed from Arabic and Persian, the vowels ‘‘a’’, ‘‘i’’ and ‘‘u’’ are
made longer or softer by using the character ^ (circumflex accent) on top
of them. In modern spelling, this approach is rarely used.
Turkish is an agglutinative language similar to Finnish and Hungarian.
Such languages carry syntactic relations between words or concepts
through discrete suffixes and have complex word structures. Turkish
words are constructed using inflectional and derivation suffixes linked to
a root. The meanings of the roots are enriched through affixation of
derivational and inflectional suffixes. Like English, nouns in Turkish
do not have a gender and the suffixes do not change depending on
word type.

The study reported in Altintas et al. (2007) proposes and examines
several stemming methods for Turkish by using a corpus that contains
712,272 tokens. The number of types (distinct words) in the corpus is
108,875, and the distinct number of stems for types is 24,388. The first 250
most frequent distinct stems constitute 47% of the corpus. Like other
agglutinative languages, in Turkish it is possible to have words that would
be translated into a complete sentence in non-agglutinative languages such
as English. One well known example in this regard is the following Turkish
word of 40 letters: Avrupalılaştırılamıyabilenlerdenmişsiniz, ‘‘You seem to
be one of those who may be incapable of being Europeanized’’ (Lewis,
1988). However, the usage of such words is uncommon (Altintas et al.,
2007; Can et al., 2008).
3.2 Corpus
In the construction of our corpus we aimed to cover the 20th-century
Turkish literature in terms of its novels. We decided to divide the century
into four quarters and include 10 novels from each era for a total of forty
novels. Table 1 provides a listing of the novels, with some statistical
information and the first publication year.
During corpus construction we aimed to represent both genders
proportional to the real number of male and female authors in each era
(Aksoy & Cankara, 2002). This implied a total of six female authors: one
female author from each of the first two eras (namely Halide Edip
Adıvar’s Kalb Agrısı, no. 7, from the first era; and Cahit Uçuk’s Dikenli
Çit, no. 13, from the second era) and two female authors from each of
the last two eras (Adalet Agaoglu’s Ölmeye Yatmak, no. 29; Füruzan’s
Kırkyedililer, no. 30, from the third era; and Pınar Kür’s Yarın Yarın,
no. 31; and Latife Tekin’s Sevgili Arsız Ölüm, no. 35, from the fourth
era). The authors and the works we covered are fairly representative in
the history of the 20th-century Turkish novel (Naci, 1999; Necatigil,
1992).
The novel sizes, in terms of number of words, vary between 25,201
(Oktay Akbal’s Garipler Sokagı, no. 20) and 159,724 (Oguz Atay’s
Tutunamayanlar, no. 28) and have an average of 63,499 and a standard
deviation of 31,474 words. As shown in Table 2, the total text sizes of era
1 to era 4, in order, are 542,645; 520,924; 796,303; and 680,125 words,
and all together 2,539,997 words. The publication information for the
novels used for optical character recognition during digitization is
provided in the Appendix.

letters ‘‘a’’, ‘‘i’’, and ‘‘u’’ with a ^ (circumflex) on top of them are included
and regarded as different from ‘‘a’’, ‘‘i’’ and ‘‘u’’. A type is defined as a
distinct word. The term vocabulary (or lexicon) means the set of all types.
According to our definition a word begins with a letter and ends with a
non-word character, and the case of letters is insignificant. The minimum
word length is defined as two (word) characters; however, the only one-
letter word of Turkish ‘‘o’’ (means ‘‘he, she, it’’) was counted as a word.

For most of our discriminant analyses and ANOVAs (analysis of vari-
ance) we needed observations based on fixed-size text blocks. We decided

that 2500 is an appropriate block size to be used (Can & Patton, 2004). In
this way we were also able to obtain at least 10 blocks from each novel. We
only use complete blocks and the incomplete residual last blocks of the
novels are not used in the experiments. Thus, for the eras 1 to 4, we res-
pectively obtained 211, 203, 312, and 266 blocks (all together 992 blocks).
As indicated earlier we used six style markers: ‘‘most frequent words’’,
‘‘sentence length in terms of words’’, ‘‘syllable counts in tokens’’, ‘‘syllable
count in types’’, ‘‘token length’’ and ‘‘type length’’. For sentence length we
counted the number of words in each sentence. Any sentence with a length
of 250 and more is assumed to have the length 250. There were very few
sentences like this. However, the novel Tutunamayanlar (no. 28) had eight
sentences with more than 1000 words (actually in these passages, as a part
of his literary style, Oguz Atay writes without end of sentence punctuation
symbols). Orhan Pamuk’s novel Sessiz Ev (no. 34) contains two sentences
with more than 1000 words. Like that of Atay’s case, this is a part of
Pamuk’s literary style. Perhaps by this way these authors are trying to
present their capabilities in literary art. Any word with a length of 30 and
more is assumed to have the length 30. Such words are uncommon in
Turkish and appear only a few times (Can et al., 2008). Again Oguz Atay’s
novel contains words like this, since in this novel some sentences are in the
form of single words without the use of blank spaces.
4.2 Determining Most Frequent Words
For the selection of most frequent words we wanted to give the same
significance to each novel independent of its size. For this purpose we
found the relative frequency of each word (i.e. the ratio of number of
occurrences of a word to the total number of tokens) in each novel, sum-
med these relative frequencies, sorted the words according to this sum, and
selected the top 30 (in some experiments, the top 60) words. In the exp-
eriments we use these words as our most frequent words. These words are
listed in Figure 2 in two different ways: first according to decreasing order
of occurrence frequencies and then for easy reference in alphabetical order.
5. EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
In this section we first perform a principal component analysis (PCA) and
cluster the novels using most frequent words to graphically illustrate the
differences among the works of four eras. PCA is used as a motivational

tool for additional analyses as well as a visualization tool. Next, for each
style marker, a stepwise discriminant analysis is conducted to determine
the best discriminators for classifying novel blocks to their respective eras
and in effect reduces the dimensionality of the problem. This is followed
by a discriminant analysis using cross-validation to determine the success
rate of these discriminators. In cross-validation, each block of a given
novel is classified based on linear discriminant functions derived from
blocks of all the other novels. These linear discrimination functions are
derived using the best discriminators obtained from a stepwise
discriminant analysis applied to all the blocks of the other novels. This
strict form of cross-validation completely eliminates author bias.
We also consider the author gender identification problem using
discriminant analysis and studying the gender differences regarding the
use of most frequent words. Then we study the change in the usage of
most frequent words independent of gender. Finally, using blocks, we
compare the average token and type lengths among the works of each era
by conducting an ANOVA.
5.1 Clustering of Novels Using Style Markers
The PCA plot, Figure 3, provides a visualization of the similarities
among the novels by using the number of occurrences information of the
Fig. 2. Most frequent 60 words (each word is followed by its English translation). (A)
Words are listed in decreasing order of occurrence frequencies. (B) Words are listed in
alphabetical order; ‘‘da’’ and ‘‘de’’ are essentially the same word (the surface form
difference is due to vowel harmony).

most frequent 30 words. Using the top 30 was enough since the first two
components explain 39% of the variance of the terms and using 60 does
not make it any higher. For PCA we use the complete novels’ vectors
(i.e. no blocking). In this plot the novel symbols represent one of the
four eras in which the novel was written. The labels represent the
difference between the publication year and 1900. Note that novels from
the first and second era are mostly placed on the right-hand side and the
novels of the other two eras are located on the left. Also note that the
three novels written in 1924 (denoted by the data label 24) and one of
the novels written in 1922 (Yakup Kadri Karaosmanoglu’s Nur Baba,
the novel no. 6, in the plot denoted by the label 22) have data points
very close to each other. The same is true for the two novels written in
1919 and the one written in 1920. Also the two written in 1943 are
very close.
The novels of the third era (novel no./publication year: 21/1952, 22/
1955, 23/1959, 24/1965, 26/1970, 27/1972, 29/1973, 30/1974) are again
placed very close to each other. Mehmet Rauf’s Eylül (no. 1, published in
1901) and Orhan Pamuk’s Sessiz Ev (no. 34, published in 1983) are
located far from the other works.
The PCA applied to the other style markers did not provide the
separation among the eras as the most frequent words.

5.2. Classifying Novels According to Eras with Style Markers
The details of classification for all style markers are given in Table 3.
Discriminant analysis using sentence lengths has an (average) success rate
of 34.81% for four eras. This is better than 25% success rate if everything
is random. When the token lengths are used, the success rate is 32.16%.
For type lengths the success rate is 37.71%. Syllable counts in types have
a success rate of 37.52%. Syllable counts in tokens have a success rate of
34.67%. All of these results are obtained using blocks. These markers are
not good enough for significantly clear discrimination since they show
change even among the authors of the same era. With more novels one
may obtain better results.
On the other hand, discriminant analysis using most frequent words
gave results with high accuracy in distinguishing the four eras. Using 60
most frequent words, a success rate of 57.27% was achieved using cross-
validation.
5.3 Gender Identification and Frequent Word Usage Change with Gender
In this section we consider two gender-related problems. In the analysis
of these problems it should be remembered that, unlike some other
Asiatic languages such as Arabic and Japanese, Turkish is gender-
neutral, i.e., involves no gender-specific constructs.
5.3.1 Gender Identification
Using the 40 complete novel vectors, a series of discriminant analyses were
conducted for classifying gender using various style markers. To eliminate
author bias, cross-validation was used where each novel was classified
based on linear discrimination functions derived from the other novels.
Using the 30 most frequent words provides a correct weighted
classification rate of 94.1%. In this case, all female authors (6) are
classified correctly, whereas four male authors are classified incorrectly.
In this calculation, male and female authors are weighted equally when
we use ‘‘weighted classification’’. In our case the 100% correct classi-
fication rate of female authors is averaged with the 30/34¼ 88.23%
classification rate of male authors (the average of these two numbers
provide the correct weighted classification rate given above). The average
word frequency for each novel was used as the data values where the
average was based on word frequencies of each block of a given novel.
The best discriminators for the 30 most frequent word cases are the
following: ‘‘bu’’, ‘‘çok’’, ‘‘da’’, ‘‘ne’’, ‘‘ama’’, ‘‘için’’, and ‘‘kadar’’.

Another style marker providing highly accurate results in discriminat-
ing gender was sentence length. The weighted classification rate using
cross-validation was 94.1% with all female authors classified correctly
and only four male authors classified incorrectly. Sentences of eight, nine
or 10 words were the best discriminators, with females writing a higher
percentage of these. A sentence of 39 words was also a good
discriminator, with male authors writing a higher percentage.
Other style markers providing good results were token lengths
providing a weighted classification rate of 83.8% and type lengths
providing a rate of 77.5%.
The discriminant analysis using the other style markers, syllable counts
in tokens and syllable counts in types, were less impressive providing
classification rates of 52% and 57% respectively.
5.3.2 Frequent Word Usage Change with Gender
Using blocks as the unit of measurement, a MANOVA was conducted to
determine which of the most frequent words had a significant change in
usage during the four eras for each gender. The frequency of the best
word discriminators for gender was used as the response variables, and
the era number was used as the classification variable. Separate analyses
were done for each gender. Multiple comparisons of the frequencies of
these words between eras were done using a Scheffe correction since six
such comparisons were required to find usage change. Table 4 lists the

most frequent words whose usage has significantly changed between eras
for both male and female authors.
For male authors the usage of ‘‘çok’’, ‘‘da’’ and ‘‘ama’’ has increased
from Era 1 to Era 4, whereas the usage of the word ‘‘bu’’, ‘‘için’’ and
‘‘kadar’’ have decreased. For female authors the words ‘‘da’’ and ‘‘ama’’
have increased usage over the four eras whereas ‘‘bu’’, ‘‘çok’’, ‘‘için’’ and
‘‘kadar’’ have decreased.
5.4 Identifying Language Change in Terms of Frequent Word Use
and Word Length
5.4.1 Change in Most Frequent Words and Word-Choice Preference
Change
The use of words may also show change with time in terms of their usage
frequency. For example, Woods (2003) shows that the most frequent
word in modern Spanish was considerably less frequent during the 16th
and 17th centuries. Table 5 lists words whose frequency of usage is
significantly different between eras independent of gender. The words
showing increasing usage in between Era 1 and Era 4 are ‘‘de’’, ‘‘ama’’
and ‘‘da’’; the words showing decreasing usage are ‘‘bir’’, ‘‘bu’’, ‘‘bütün’’,
‘‘fakat,’’ ‘‘kadar’’ and ‘‘onun’’.
We do get strong relationships with frequency usage of ‘‘ama’’ and
‘‘fakat’’ versus both year and era using blocks as the unit of
measurement. The usage of ‘‘ama’’ increases and ‘‘fakat’’ decreases over
time. For example, in terms of blocks the correlation is –0.1022; it is
significant at p¼ 0.0013. These words mean ‘‘but’’ in English. We claim
that less frequent use of ‘‘fakat’’ and more frequent use of ‘‘ama’’ or the
replacement of the former with the latter is due to increasing word
lengths with time (see the next section for the discussion of the temporal
word length increase in Turkish). Since Turkish words have become
longer with time, to add a variety to their style as time passes, authors are

inclined to prefer ‘‘ama’’ (a shorter word) over ‘‘fakat’’ (a longer word)
with the same meaning. Note that both of these words are loan words
that are borrowed from Arabic (TDK, 1974). Therefore, this preference
shift cannot be attributed to the Turkish language (purification) reform,
which aimed to replace words of foreign origin with their Turkish
equivalents (Lewis, 1999). Further research is needed on this; however,
the strong statistical relationship we observe is an important pointer on
the validity of this claim.
5.4.2 Change in Word Lengths
To illustrate comparisons of values for the style markers, type length and
token length for each era, two plots are presented in Figure 4. The first
(left) scattergram based on 40 novel vectors (no blocking) shows that
token length tends to increase as the publication date increases. A
weighted least squares regression was performed. Since the sizes of the
novels vary from one another, the weight applied to each novel was based
on its total number of tokens. For this regression R2¼ 0.153,
F(1,38)¼ 6.87 (p¼ 0.012). Since p5 0.05, we have significant evidence
of a linear relationship. This is truly remarkable considering the large
amount of intra-author variation between novels and our modest sample
size. The prediction equation is given by
Average token length ¼ 5:9741þ 0:00368  ðyear 1900Þ
So for each year after 1900, the average token length would increase by
approximately 0.00368. The predicted values are included in the plot.

Likewise, type lengths tend to increase over time according to the
second (right) scattergram of Figure 4 based on 40 novel vectors. Again,
we applied weighted least squares regression using the same weights as
the above analysis. For this regression R2¼ 0.200, F(1,38)¼ 9.50
(p¼ 0.004). Since p5 0.01, the results indicate strong evidence of a
linear relationship. The prediction equation is given by
Average type length ¼ 8:0127þ 0:00609  ðyear 1900Þ
So for each year after 1900, the average type length would increase by
approximately 0.00609.
We also use a sliding window approach that exploits smaller-scale
temporal groupings (Kjell et al., 1994). Its purpose is to capture token
and type length variations with a finer level of granularity (Abbasi &
Chen, 2008). In this approach five consecutive novels were used for each
data point. The first data point was based on the first five novels. The
second point was based on novels 2 to 6 and so on; novels 36 to 40
formed the last data point. This gave us a total of 36 observations.
Similar results were obtained for both types and tokens using the ‘‘sliding
window’’ approach to the regression. The token length was the weighted
average of the respective average token lengths of the five novels where
the weights were based on the respective number of tokens of the five
novels. Likewise, the type length was a weighted average using the
number of types of each novel as the basis for the weights. The year
coordinate was the average of the publication years of the five novels.
The regression equations for token and type lengths were almost identical
to those above. However, the results were much more significant since
much of the variation between novels was smoothed out due to the
averaging.
Even more powerful results were obtained using blocks as cases instead
of the complete novel vectors. ANOVAs were conducted using a nested
design where the classification variable, novel number (1–40), was nested
in the classification variable era. Token length and type length were the
response variables. The token length ANOVA had an R2¼ 0.767, an F
statistic F(39,954)¼ 80.32 (p5 0.0001), and the average token lengths for
each era is shown in Table 6. With the exception of eras 2 and 3, each
pairwise comparison was significant at an a¼ 0.05.
The type length ANOVA had an R2¼ 0.763, an F statistic
F(39,954)¼ 78.56 (p5 0.0001), and average type lengths for each era

are shown in Table 6. Note that the average type length for each era is the
average of all average type lengths for each block belonging to that era.
With the exception of eras 1 and 3, each pairwise comparison was
significant at (a5 0.05).
Both the average token and type length in the 3rd era were smaller than
the respective lengths in eras 2 and 4 due to the inclusion of three village
novels (21, 22, and 26) in era 3. The fictional characters of these novels are
mostly rural people and the novels contain dialogs among them.
One can argue that for measuring word length change we can use
sample texts from each quarter-century, compute the mean word length,
test for normality, and then carry out a significance test on the results. To
perform such an analysis, we should use the entire set of 40 novels to
determine how type or token lengths vary over time. By choosing one
novel at random from each era, and using blocks as a unit of
measurement, one would be able to analyse how token lengths vary
but not type lengths (since in that case the entire novel would need to be
used as a measurement unit). Using all 40 novels would provide a richer
set of data. By choosing 10 novels from each era or using the sliding time
window approach we also get a balanced design.
6. CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK
We provide a quantitative analysis of the 20th-century Turkish literature
using a stylometric approach. The PCA results using most frequent
words provide visual separation between the works of different eras.
These results motivate further analysis. We use discriminant analysis
based on cross-validation using six style markers. Among these style
markers, ‘‘most frequent words’’ provide the best discrimination among
the four eras. Sentence lengths, as well as most frequent words, provide
Table 6. Average token and type length for each era using blocks.

decidedly accurate (more than 90%) separation of authors according to
their gender. As also indicated by Koppel et al. (2002) this is a surprising
result, since large classes of authors are likely to exhibit inconsistent
habits of style.
Our findings show that in Turkish as time passes, words, both in terms
of tokens and types, have become longer. These are in agreement with the
findings of our previous studies which are based on parallel old and new
translations of seven works (Altintas et al., 2008) and old and new works
of two Turkish authors (Can & Patton, 2004). The results presented in
this work are much more widespread and decisive, since they are based
on a much larger corpus that includes the works of, not two, but several
different authors. They also cover a century-wide time span and involve
no translations. In measuring the word length change, we not only use
the four eras but also a sliding window approach. This approach captures
token and type length variations with a finer level of granularity since five
consecutive novels are used to generate each data point. In the sliding
window approach, the results are much more significant since many of
the variations between novels are smoothed out due to the averaging.
The increase in word lengths with time can be attributed to the
government-initiated language ‘‘reform’’ of the 20th century (Lewis,
1999). This reform aimed at replacing foreign words used in Turkish,
especially Arabic- and Persian-based words (since they were in the
majority when the reform was initiated in early 1930s), with newly-coined
pure Turkish neologisms created by adding suffixes to Turkish word
stems (Lewis, 1999).
Based on our observations of the change of a specific word use (more
specifically in newer works the preference of ‘‘ama’’ over ‘‘fakat’’ where
both mean ‘‘but’’ in English and their inverse usage correlation is
statistically significant), we speculate that the word length increase can
influence the common word choice preferences of authors. It should be
noted that these words (‘‘ama’’ and ‘‘fakat’’) are borrowed from Arabic
and, therefore, the preference change cannot be attributed to the Turkish
language reform.
Our observations on Turkish language change are valuable for
researchers working on historical linguistic or sociolinguistic analysis of
the Turkish language. The principal component analysis-based clustering
results similar to ours can be used for identifying previously unknown
similarities and differences of the eras and authors’ styles. They can also
serve as external evidence in literary criticism. Our gender-related

findings can be useful in gender-specific studies in Turkish literature. In
future studies, machine learning techniques or syntax- and character-
based measures can be used. Furthermore, temporal groupings of novels
can be done using taxonomies from literary studies or important time
marks. The effects of word length change on authors’ common word
choices and further quantitative analysis of temporal word choice
preference shifts are other interesting future research possibilities.
