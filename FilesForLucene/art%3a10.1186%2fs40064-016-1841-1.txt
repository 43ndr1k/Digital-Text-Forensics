Comparing writing style feature‑based 
classification methods for estimating user 
reputations in social media
Jong Hwan Suh* 
Background
For the last decade, the development of the Internet and mobile devices has increased 
the popularity of social media (Sherchan et al. 2013; Beato et al. 2015). Social media var-
ies in form and purpose, including blogs, e.g. Blogspot, microblogs, e.g. Twitter, discus-
sion forums, e.g. Epinions, media sharing sites, e.g. YouTube, and social networks, e.g. 
Facebook (Kaplan and Haenlein 2010; Sun et al. 2015). People take advantage of social 
media as an electronic communication platform to share information, express their 
opinions, and construct their social networks, and furthermore to hear the voice of other 
users (Suh 2015; Sherchan et al. 2013; Li et al. 2013). Besides, information and opinion, 
Abstract 
In recent years, the anonymous nature of the Internet has made it difficult to detect 
manipulated user reputations in social media, as well as to ensure the qualities of 
users and their posts. To deal with this, this study designs and examines an auto-
matic approach that adopts writing style features to estimate user reputations in 
social media. Under varying ways of defining Good and Bad classes of user reputa-
tions based on the collected data, it evaluates the classification performance of the 
state-of-art methods: four writing style features, i.e. lexical, syntactic, structural, and 
content-specific, and eight classification techniques, i.e. four base learners—C4.5, 
Neural Network (NN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Naïve Bayes (NB)—and four 
Random Subspace (RS) ensemble methods based on the four base learners. When 
South Korea’s Web forum, Daum Agora, was selected as a test bed, the experimental 
results show that the configuration of the full feature set containing content-specific 
features and RS-SVM combining RS and SVM gives the best accuracy for classification 
if the test bed poster reputations are segmented strictly into Good and Bad classes by 
portfolio approach. Pairwise t tests on accuracy confirm two expectations coming from 
the literature reviews: first, the feature set adding content-specific features outperform 
the others; second, ensemble learning methods are more viable than base learners. 
Moreover, among the four ways on defining the classes of user reputations, i.e. like, dis-
like, sum, and portfolio, the results show that the portfolio approach gives the highest 
accuracy.

shared and shaped through social media, influence individual views of society and incite 
on and offline political participations, e.g. South Korea candlelight protest of 2008 and 
United States Occupy Wall Street of 2011. Thus, now social media has become an open 
platform for political and social innovations (Suh 2015; de Zuniga 2012).
However, there are problems and challenging issues for social media to grow into a 
better online place for political and social innovations, as well as for trusty information 
and opinions sharing. First, the anonymous nature of the Internet makes it difficult to 
ensure the qualities of users and their posts in social media. If there is no online user 
feedback on an anonymous user’s posts, e.g. like and dislike, there is no way to find 
whether the anonymous user is good or bad before reading her/his post. This makes 
users in social media vulnerable to low quality posts and posters, offending and deceiv-
ing. Second, manipulations on user reputations arouse suspicion and mistrust on the 
online feedback system of social media in two ways: good quality posts and their users 
can be given low reputations maliciously by other users; some users can manipulate 
their own reputations to be high for certain reasons. However, identity changes, stem-
ming from the anonymity of the Internet, lead to insufficient past reputation records on 
social media users, and make it hard to detect the manipulations on user reputations by 
the existing approaches, e.g. suggested in Lai et al. (2013).
To resolve the abovementioned problems and challenging issues, the user reputa-
tions in social media need to be estimated upon concrete user features. Moreover, 
previous works hint that writing styles of social media users can be such objective fea-
tures (Koppel et  al. 2009). Therefore, this paper proposes an automatic approach that 
adopts the writing styles of users as objective features for estimating user reputations in 
social media. Nevertheless, following research gaps are identified through the literature 
reviews: first, no study has been made on an automated classification of user reputations 
in social media by using writing style analysis; second, when a way of defining user repu-
tations into Good and Bad classes is given, it is unclear which writing style feature and 
classification technique will be better for this study; third, there is no reference on how 
to define the classes of user reputations in social media for the better performance.
Therefore, this paper proposes a research framework to find out a better way in esti-
mating user reputations in social media by using writing style features. To explain, first 
of all, the paper segments the test bed users into Good or Bad reputation classes by pro-
posed four approaches: like, dislike, sum, and portfolio. Moreover, it extracts four writing 
style features, i.e. lexical (denoted by F1), syntactic (denoted by F2), semantic (denoted 
by F3), and content-specific (denoted by F4), to represent the reputations of the test bed 
users. Next, it evaluates the classification performance of 32 configurations, resulted by 
combining four feature sets, i.e. F1, F1 + F2, F1 + F2 + F3, and F1 + F2 + F3 + F4, and 
eight classification techniques, i.e. four base learners—C4.5, Neural Network (NN), Sup-
port Vector Machine (SVM), and Naïve Bayes (NB)—and four Random Subspace (RS) 
ensemble methods based on the four base learners, with respect to accuracy for a given 
way of defining the classes of the test bed user reputations. In addition, it statistically 
compares the classification performances of different feature sets and different classifica-
tion techniques by conducting pairwise t tests.
To sum up the contribution of this paper, it is the first work to deal with the estima-
tion of user reputations in social media by using writing style features. If a system is built 
Page 3 of 27Suh  SpringerPlus  (2016) 5:261 
based on the experimental results of this study, the system can remedy the abovemen-
tioned shortcomings of social media’s reputation system as follows. First, the user repu-
tation estimation based on writing style features helps protect users from being exposed 
to bad users and their harmful posts in social media. Second, it contributes to establish-
ing trust among social media users when sharing and searching information and opin-
ions. Eventually, these help for social media to evolve into the trustworthy virtual place 
for political/social innovations and information/opinion sharing.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. “Literature reviews” section briefly 
introduces and reviews the relevant literature. “Proposed research framework” sec-
tion outlines the proposed research framework, and explains it in detail. Subsequently, 
“Experimental results and discussions” section demonstrates and discusses the experi-
mental results of applying the suggested research framework to the Web forum of South 
Korea, Daum Agora, chosen as a test bed. “Results on comparative studies” section eval-
uates the results with statistical comparisons. Finally, “Conclusions” section concludes 
the paper with a reflection on limitations and further works.
Literature reviews
Online anonymity
Online anonymity represents the incapability of others to identify an individual in com-
puter-mediated communication (CMC) (Christopherson 2007). The online anonymity 
takes many different forms, grouped into three different types: first, visual anonymity is 
the most common type wherein physical characteristics are hidden although other iden-
tifying information is known; second, pseudonymity refers to the case when people use 
avatars or usernames as indicators of their online identity; third, full anonymity is said 
to exist where users remain unknowable after interaction has concluded, and occurs in 
the absence of any long-term usernames (Christie and Dill 2016). In this paper, the term 
anonymity refers to pseudonymity and full anonymity.
Due to the online anonymity, digesting posts in social media sometimes requires a 
great deal of risk taking, like doing businesses online without any physical interaction 
(Enders et al. 2008). For example, cyber criminals abuse the anonymous nature in social 
media to conduct malicious activities such as phishing scams, identity theft, and harass-
ment (Iqbal et al. 2013). Hence, to alleviate such risk taking in reading posts, this paper 
aims at the objective user reputation system of social media, which is effective even 
under the anonymous circumstances.
Online user feedbacks and user reputations in social media
Social media users post their opinions regarding particular objects such as products, ser-
vices, companies, people, and events (Lai et al. 2013; Shad Manaman et al. 2016). Online 
user feedback mechanisms play crucial roles in evaluating the qualities of posts and 
their users. The online user feedbacks in social media are intended to offer social control 
mechanism, allowing social translucence for improved accountability (Erickson and Kel-
logg 2000). Mainly there are two types of online user feedbacks in social media: recom-
mendations and reputations (Li et al. 2013). First, recommendations help users identify 
posts and users that suit their needs or preferences. They are usually used to solve infor-
mation overload problems (Li et al. 2013). Recommendation systems are classified into 
Page 4 of 27Suh  SpringerPlus  (2016) 5:261 
content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, or hybrid approaches (Sarwar et al. 2001; 
Jin et al. 2004; Li et al. 2005; Huang et al. 2004; Liu et al. 2014; Yang et al. 2014). Second, 
reputations are considered as a collective measure of trustworthiness based on the refer-
rals or ratings of users in social media (Jøsang et al. 2007). Reputation systems let users 
rate other users, and the ratings help determine who to trust in certain environments 
where users have to interact among themselves in online settings (Agudo et al. 2010).
Particularly for the reputation systems, there are two categories of calculating trust 
scores between users as user reputations: feature-based and graph-based. First, the 
feature-based method is to compute the trust score of an user from past ratings on 
the user’s posts (O’Donovan and Smyth 2005). Second, the graph-based approach is to 
derive the trust values based on explicitly specified relations (e.g. friends) or trust rela-
tionships of the user (Golbeck 2005). Between the two, this study adopts the first method 
that measures reputations from past ratings on the user’s posts because the anonymity 
accompanies uncovered or scarce relationships regarding the user.
Writing style features for characterizing user reputations in social media
According to systematic functional linguistic theory, a language has the textual dimen-
sion which individuals use to convey their ideas varying stylistic elements in their writ-
ings. The writing styles are influenced by education, gender, and vocabulary as well as 
subconscious factors described in the psycholinguistics works. The statistical analysis 
on such writing styles, a.k.a. authorship analysis, can discriminate authorship in social 
media (Abbasi et  al. 2008a). Because Web-based channels such as e-mail, newsgroup, 
and chat rooms are relatively casual compared with formal publications, social media 
users are more likely to leave their own styles in their writings (Zheng et  al. 2006). 
Hence, if the reputations of the social media users are characterized by their writ-
ing styles, authorship analysis can help resolve the problem of anonymity in the online 
communications of social media (Zhao et al. 2015; Iqbal et al. 2013). Previous works on 
writing style analysis in Table 1 also hint that writing styles extracted from posts can be 
objective features that characterize user reputations in social media. Actually, it is prac-
tical to use the writing style features for the anonymous users in social media because 
other features, e.g. their relationships as graph-based features, are not available in most 
cases. Nonetheless, to our best knowledge, there is no previous work made on classify-
ing the reputations of social media users by using their writing styles.
Writing style markers that are known as the most effective discriminators of author-
ship in social media are lexical, syntactic, structural, and content-specific writing style 
features. Here, lexical, syntactic, and structural writing style features are called the con-
tent-free writing style features (Zhang et al. 2011; Jiang et al. 2014). Among the four writ-
ing style features in social media, the content-specific writing style features are expected 
to outperform the other content-free writing style features for this study because of their 
two characteristics: first, they consist of important keywords and phrases, so they are 
more meaningful with high representative ability than the other writing style features 
(Zhang et  al. 2011); second, they contain a much larger number of n-grams extracted 
from the collected social media data, and the large potential feature spaces are known to 
be effective for online text classification (Abbasi and Chen 2008). Despite, all the writing 
style features used in Jiang et al. (2014) are considered for this study because there is no

previous work that has shown which writing style feature is more useful for this study 
that aims to estimate user reputations in social media.
Classification techniques for writing style analysis
Three major types of writing style analysis tasks are identification, similarity detection, 
and classification (Zheng et al. 2006; Abbasi and Chen 2005). First, identification entails 
comparing anonymous texts against those belonging to identified entities, where the 
anonymous text is known to be written by one of those entities. Second, similarity detec-
tion task requires the comparison of anonymous texts against other anonymous texts 
in order to assess the degree of similarity. Third, classification is related to categorizing 
objects in regards to their properties, e.g. gender, by using their writing styles as features 
that represent the properties. This study belongs to the third category of classification 
techniques for writing style analysis.
For the classification task, this paper adopts the supervised techniques because they 
have been extensively studied due to their predominant classification performance 
(Zheng et al. 2006; Abbasi and Chen 2009). In general, supervised techniques for classi-
fication consist of two steps: first, the extraction of features from training data and their 
conversion to feature vectors; second, training of the classifier on the feature vectors and 
application of the classifier to unseen instances. Hence, feature construction and learn-
ing method selection are crucial for accurate classification.
Referring to the classification techniques of previous writing style analysis works sum-
marized in Table  1, four main supervised techniques are adopted as base learners for 
this study. To explain, first, C4.5, an extension of the ID3 algorithm, is a decision-tree 
building algorithm developed by Quinlan (1986), and it adopts a divide-and-conquer 
strategy and an entropy measure for object classification. Its goal is to classify mixed 
objects into their associated classes based on the objects’ attribute values. Second, NN 
has been popular because of its unique learning capability (Widrow et al. 1994), and has 
achieved good performance in many different applications (Giles et al. 1998; Kim and 
Lewis 2000; Tolle et al. 2000). Third, SVM is a novel learning machine first introduced by 
Vapnik (1995), and is based on the structural risk minimization principle from compu-
tational learning theory. Because SVM can handle millions of inputs with good perfor-
mance (Cristianini and Shawe-Taylor 2000; Joachims 2002), it was introduced to writing 
style analysis in many previous works (Argamon et al. 2003; Vel et al. 2001; Diederich 
et al. 2003). Fourth, based on Bayes Theorem (Barnard 1958), NB is a fairly simple prob-
abilistic classification algorithm that uses strong independence assumptions regarding 
various features (Yang et al. 2002). It assumes that the presence of any feature is entirely 
independent of the presence of the other features, and allows building classification 
models efficiently.
Among the four base learners, SVM is a highly robust technique that has provided 
powerful classification capabilities for online authorship analysis. In head-to-head com-
parisons, SVM significantly outperformed other supervised learning methods such as 
NN and C4.5 (Zheng et al. 2006; Abbasi and Chen 2009). Similarly, SVM is expected to 
outperform the other base learners for this study. However, for writing style analysis, it 
is unclear which classification technique consistently performs better than others for a 
given problem in a given domain.
Page 9 of 27Suh  SpringerPlus  (2016) 5:261 
Moreover, for this uncertainty, it is not uncommon to conduct multiple learners and 
create an integrated classifier based on overall performance (Wang et al. 2014). Hence, 
in addition to the four base learners, this paper combines an ensemble learning method 
to each of the four base learners. Ensemble learning is a machine learning paradigm 
where multiple learners are trained to solve the same problem. In contrast to base learn-
ers that try to learn one hypothesis from the training data, ensemble learning methods 
try to conduct a set of hypotheses and combine them for use. In general, ensemble learn-
ing methods are divided into two categories: first, Boosting and Bagging are instance 
partitioning methods; second, feature partitioning methods include RS (Polikar 2006; 
Zhou 2012; Wang et al. 2014).
For this study, RS is selected as an ensemble learning method because it showed better 
accuracy than Boosting and Bagging in Wang et al. (2014). RS is an ensemble construc-
tion technique proposed by (Tin Kam 1998), and modifies the training dataset in the fea-
ture space. RS considers that, if one obtain better base learners in random spaces than in 
the original feature space, the combined decision of such base learners can be superior 
to a single classifier constructed on the original training dataset in the complete feature 
sets (Wang et al. 2014). Eventually, RS is combined with the four base learners selected 
for this study, and the resulted four multiple learner methods, i.e. RS-C4.5, RS-NN, RS-
SVM, and RS-NB, are additionally adopted for this study. Considering the superiority 
of SVM to the other three base learners, RS-SVM is expected to outperform the other 
three ensemble learning methods.
Proposed research framework
To design and examine an automatic approach that uses writing style features for esti-
mating user reputations in social media, this study proposes a research framework as 
outlined in Fig. 1. The research framework answers below research questions.
RQ1 How does writing style features perform for estimating user reputations in social 
media?
RQ2 Which writing style features are the best at estimating user reputations by classifi-
cation techniques in social media?
RQ3 Which classification technique is better suited at differentiating user reputations 
with writing style features in social media?
RQ4 Which method to define user reputation classes, i.e. Good and Bad, works better 
for estimating user reputations with writing style features in social media?
Ultimately, the research framework is intended for developing a system, which is capa-
ble of differentiating between Good and Bad reputation users by using stylistic tenden-
cies inherent their writings in social media. In a nutshell, it consists of four steps: data 
collection, data representation, classification, and evaluation with comparisons. The fol-
lowing sub sections explain the details of each step in the research framework.
Collect data
This study uses the Web forum for data collection because it is a major type of social 
media with a balanced nature of discussions among participants and a relatively broader 
Page 10 of 27Suh  SpringerPlus  (2016) 5:261 
range of topics (Zhang et  al. 2011). The data collection from the Web forum has two 
steps, crawling and parsing. First, the developed Web crawler programs collect the 
online data from the Web forum as HTML pages. Then, users whose posts had been 
evaluated at least once by the others are selected, and the posts and their past ratings 
are parsed out for the selected users from the raw HTML pages, and are stored in a rela-
tional database.

Represent user reputations by writing style features
In this step, writing style features are extracted as independent variables to represent 
the reputations of the collected and selected users from the Web forum. The class of a 
user reputation is obtained from her/his online user feedbacks by using different ways of 
defining user reputation classes. The details are explained in the following sub-sections.
Extract writing style features
This study generates different feature sets containing different types of writing style fea-
tures. By doing so, we can compare and evaluate the performance of different writing 
style sets in estimating the classes of the selected users’ reputations. Table  2 lists the 
writing style features in social media, adopted for this study. In this paper, the differ-
ent writing style features are denoted as follows: lexical features F1, syntactic features 
F2, structural features F3, and content-specific features F4. The writing style features of 
Table 2 are based on the prior studies in Table 1, mainly from Jiang et al. (2014). In addi-
tion, unlike the previous works, emotional writing style features are included to F1 for 
this study. The emoticon refers to graphic representations of facial expressions, which 
often follow utterances in written CMC, and are produced by ASCII symbols or by 
graphic symbols (Skovholt et al. 2014).
As a result, the four types of writing style features, i.e. F1, F2, F3, F4, are obtained after 
feature extraction. Based on those different types of writing style features, four feature 
sets are constructed in an incremental way: feature set F1; feature set F1 + F2; feature 
set F1 + F2 + F3; feature set F1 + F2 + F3 + F4. This incremental order implies the 
evolutionary sequence of features (Zheng et al. 2006; Abbasi and Chen 2008; Zhang et al. 
2011).
Next, for feature selection, information gain (IG) heuristic is adopted due to its 
reported effectiveness in previous online text classification. IG (C, A) measures the 
amount of entropy decrease on a class C when providing a feature A (Quinlan 1986; 
Shannon 1948; Zhang et al. 2011). The decreasing amount of entropy reflects the addi-
tional information gained by adding feature A, and higher values between 0 and 1 indi-
cate more information gained by providing certain features (Zhang et al. 2011). In this 
study, writing style features with IG (C, A) > 0.0025 are selected by referring to previous 
related works (Yang and Pedersen 1997; Abbasi et al. 2008b; Zhang et al. 2011).
Segment the selected users’ reputations into Good and Bad classes
The selected Web forum users are segmented into Good and Bad reputation groups 
based on the ratings regarding their posts. In social media, there are generally two types 
of online user feedbacks: like and dislike, although there are various types of past ratings 
on their posts, e.g. helpfulness on reviews and reviewer rankings in Amazon.com, likes 
in Facebook, retweets in Twitter, ratings on sellers in eBay, ratings on answers in Q&A, 
etc. Hence, this paper proposes the four ways of defining social media users’ reputations 
into two classes: Good and Bad. The four approaches are named as segmenting type 
s =  {like, dislike, sum, and portfolio}, and the reputation classes for users, reputations, 
are respectively defined as
(1)reputationlike(useri) =
{
Good if like(useri) ≥ mlike
Bad otherwise
}
,
Page 12 of 27Suh  SpringerPlus  (2016) 5:261 
where like(useri) is the number of likes that useri obtained per a post in social media, and 
mlike is the average of like(useri) for i = 1, …, N.
where dislike(useri) is the number of dislikes that useri obtained per a post in social 
media, and mdislike is the average of dislike(useri) for i = 1, …, N.
(2)reputationdislike(useri) =
{
Good if dislike(useri) < mdisike
Bad otherwise
}
,
(3)reputationsum(useri) =
{
Good if sum(useri) ≥ msum
Bad otherwise
}
,

Estimate reputations of the selected users
This paper adopts four base learners, i.e. C4.5, NN, SVM, and NB, commonly used for 
previous studies of writing styles in social media. Moreover, RS as an ensemble learning 
method is combined with the four base learners, resulting in RS-C4.5, RS-NN, RS-SVM, 
and RS-NB. In total, these eight classification techniques are used for this study. For 
an experiment, randomly 100 users for each reputation class are selected from the col-
lected data, and a tenfold validation is performed to train a classifier and evaluate it. To 
implement the adopted eight classification techniques, the data mining toolkit WEKA 
(Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis) version 3.7.0 is used with all the default 
parameters because it is the most commonly used open-source toolkit with a collection 
of machine learning algorithms for solving data mining problems (Wang et  al. 2014). 
In detail, the WEKA modules for algorithms used in this study are as follows: J48 mod-
ule for C4.5, Multilayer Perceptron module for NN, SMO module for SVM, Naïve Bayes 
module for NB, and Random Subspace module for RS.
Evaluate results with comparisons
To assess the performance of each feature set and each classification technique, this 
paper adopts the standard classification performance metrics. For the given segmenting 
type s, they are defined as
To enhance understanding, Fig.  2 illustrates each metric of Eqs.  (5)–(7). These four 
metrics have been widely used in information retrieval and text classification studies 
(Abbasi et al. 2008b; Li et al. 2008; Zhang et al. 2011). Among the four standard meas-
ures, accuracy assesses the overall classification correctness, while the others evaluate 
the correctness regarding each class. Therefore, this paper performs comparisons with 
respect to accuracy.
The comparisons are done by pairwise t tests because pairwise t test comparisons are 
the simplest kind of statistical tests and commonly used for comparing the performance 
of two algorithms (Derrac et al. 2011). To check whether the average difference in two

approaches’ performance is significantly different from zero, this paper repeats the same 
experiments 50 times in two ways. First, to examine the effect of adding one feature set 
on accuracy for a certain classification technique, this paper conducts 24 (=three feature 
set comparisons × eight classification techniques) individual pairwise t tests. Second, to 
compare the performance of classification techniques on accuracy for a certain feature 
set, the paper conducts 64 (=24 + 24 + 16) individual pairwise t tests: 24 (=six tech-
nique comparisons × four feature sets) between base learners, i.e. Base versus Base, 24 
(=six technique comparisons × four feature sets) between ensemble learning methods 
of RS, i.e. Ensemble versus Ensemble, and 16 (=four technique comparisons × four fea-
ture sets) between base learners and ensemble learning methods of RS, i.e. Base versus 
Ensemble.
Experimental results and discussions
Test bed: a Korean Web forum
This study targeted South Korea as a test bed country because South Korea has shown 
that social media can be used not only to exchange information and opinions, but also to 
organize the street protests and empower people to be active in the protests (Suh et al. 
2010; Suh 2015). In particular, South Korea’s Web forum, called Daum Agora (http://
agora.media.daum.net), was chosen as a test bed social media for three reasons: fist, 
Daum Agora is one of the most popular and anonymous Web forums in South Korea; 
second, it has been used from the early age of social media, i.e. the mid 2000 s. Hence, 
it contains a large-scale data with millions of posts and comments starting from August

2004; third, it is on a national scale so most of the main topics in South Korea are dis-
cussed through Daum Agora (Suh 2015). In this sense, Daum Agora proves sufficient 
and ideal for the Web forum of South Korea.
The web crawler program collected the posting data from Daum Agora, which had 
been generated for the past 5  years from 2007 to 2011, and were stored in the rela-
tional database for the experiments. In total, the online data on 2,565,918 posts from 
91,968 users were collected. Among the collected users, users, of which posts had been 
evaluated at least once by the others, were selected for the experiments, and they are 
22,131 users. Based on the collected data, the writing style features of 22,131 users are 
extracted.
Next, the online user feedbacks regarding the posts of the selected 22,1131 users were 
extracted from the collected data. In case of the test bed Daum Agora, there are two 
types of online user feedbacks: like and dislike. Based on these, the classes of the selected 
22,131 users’ reputations were obtained by different segmenting types. As a result, 
Table 3 shows the number of users that belong to each user reputation class by different 
segmenting types. Moreover, from the selected 22,131 users, 100 users and their posts 
were randomly sampled for each class of user reputations in an experiment.
Evaluations and discussions
Table  4 shows experimental results on accuracy for different writing feature sets 
and different classification techniques. To explain key findings, first, the feature set 
F1 +  F2 +  F3 +  F4 gave the best accuracy for all the segmenting types except when 
segmenting type s  =  sum. On the other hand, RS-SVM gave the highest accuracy 
regardless of segmenting types. Second, among the 32 combinations, the feature set 
F1 +  F2 +  F3 +  F4 and RS-SVM ranked the best, i.e. 94.50  %, in terms of accuracy 
for all the segmenting types. Likewise, the results in Table 4 indicate the superiority of 
the feature set F1 + F2 + F3 + F4 and RS-SVM. It is aligned with the paper’s expecta-
tions stated in the Literature Reviews section, and the possible reason is that their com-
mon advantage of handling with tens of thousands features made them have the best 
teamwork.
In addition, the best accuracies were identified respectively for all four segmenting 
types, and were compared to each other. For classification techniques, reputationportfolio 
type gave the highest accuracy, i.e. 94.50 %, if the feature set F1 + F2 + F3 + F4 and

the classification technique RS-SVM are used. On the other hand, reputationsum type 
gave the lowest best accuracy, i.e. 82.50 %, if the feature set F1 + F2 + F3 and the clas-
sification technique RS-SVM are used. Thus, it is seen that the more accurate way of 
segmenting user reputations by portfolio approach contributed to its higher accuracy 
than the other segmenting ways. Whereas, reputationsum type made it more difficult to 
classify user reputations, of which like(useri) and dislike(useri) are in a tense conflict.
Table 5 shows the evaluation results on precision, recall, and F-measure. To explain, 
the feature set F1 + F2 + F3 + F4 achieved the highest precisions: 98.88 % with RS-NN 
for reputationdislike  =  Good, and 94.95  % with RS-SVM for reputationportfolio  =  Bad. 
Next, the feature set F1 + F2 + F3 + F4 and RS-NN gave the highest recalls: 100 % for 
reputationsum = Good, and 99.00 % for reputationdislike = Bad. The highest F-measures 
were achieved by the feature set F1 + F2 + F3 + F4 in cooperation with RS-SVM when 
segmenting type s = portfolio, i.e. 94.53 % for reputationportfolio = Good, and 94.47 % 
for reputationportfolio =  Bad. Putting together, these results show that the feature set 
F1 + F2 + F3 + F4 and ensemble learning methods gave the best precision, recall, and 
F-measure for both Good and Bad classes of user reputations.
Results on comparative studies
On comparisons of different feature sets
Table  6 shows the results of the pairwise t tests, conducted to examine the effect of 
different feature sets on accuracy for a certain classification technique. It reveals that,

regardless of segmenting types, adding one type of writing style features improved most 
of classification accuracies except adding the structural features F3. The insignificant 
effect of adding F3 is because its size is small so its representation capability is smaller 
than adding the other features.
Moreover, the feature set F1 + F2 + F3 + F4 gave the best results for all eight clas-
sification techniques, regardless of the segmenting type. This suggests that the four 
feature sets provide important complementary and discriminatory potential if they are 
exploited by incorporating them in unison. Thus, a large set of rich writing style features 
are beneficial for automated classification on the reputations of social media users. Espe-
cially, it shows adding the content-specific writing style features F4 contributes to the 
best accuracy as expected in the Literature Reviews section. It indicates that keywords 
and phrases on certain topics are more important grounds to judge users than the other 
content-free writing style features in social media.
On comparisons of different classification techniques
Table 7 shows the results of the pairwise t tests, performed to investigate the effect of 
different classification techniques on accuracy for a specific feature set. For a given seg-
menting type s, classification techniques were compared in three parts: Base versus Base, 
Ensemble versus Ensemble, and Base versus Ensemble. In Table 7, it was observed that 
the ranks of all eight classification techniques are different according to the selected fea-
ture set.
From Table 7, there are two key findings. First, there is no single classification tech-
nique that gave the best accuracy for all the feature sets in any given segmenting type. 
Second, ensemble learning methods are better than base learners in most of configura-
tions. The reason is that the ensemble learning methods consider the writing style fea-
tures in its entirety whereas the base learners only consider the average of the aggregated 
writing style features. This difference made the ensemble learning methods preserve the 
important information better than the base learners, and resulted in better accuracies.
On comparisons of different ways in defining the classes of user reputations
In Table  4, regarding segmenting types, it is remarkable that the segmenting type 
s =  dislike gave the highest precision for both Good and Bad classes. It means that 
segmenting users by their dislike scores is the best way in terms of precision. Moreo-
ver, the segmenting type s = portfolio gave the highest F-measure when the feature set 
F1 + F2 + F3 + F4 and RS-SVM are combined: 94.53 % for Good class and 94.47 % for 
Bad class. One possible reason is that the more accurately segmenting users by portfolio 
approach contributed to higher F-measure than the other segmenting types. However, 
because the segmenting type s = portfolio classifies users more strictly into Bad class, its 
bests in terms of precision and recall were worse than the bests of the other segmenting 
types.
Moreover, in Table 7, it is seen that, when reputationportfolio was used, the feature set 
F1 + F2 + F3 + F4 and RS-SVM gave the best accuracy among all the configurations. 
The possible reason is that reputationportfolio classified users into Good class if they are 
certainly good, and strictly filtered users into Bad class if we are unsure about whether 
they belong to Good or Bad class.

Conclusions
This paper proposed a research framework to design and examine an automatic system 
that estimates user reputations of social media into Good and Bad classes by adopt-
ing writing styles. Using the most popular Web forum in South Korea, Daum Agora, 
selected as a test bed, the application was conducted by following the suggested research 
framework of the paper.
Consequently, the experimental results in Table 4 show that the configuration of the 
feature set F1 + F2 + F3 + F4 and RS-SVM gave the best accuracy, i.e. 94.50 %, when seg-
menting type s = portfolio. It proves possible to classify user reputations by writing style 
features in social media with high accuracy (RQ1 is answered). In Table 6, the pairwise t 
tests on accuracy for different feature sets show that the feature set F1 + F2 + F3 + F4

ranked the best for all eight classification techniques regardless of segmenting types 
(RQ2 is answered). It represents that keywords and phrases on certain topics affect user 
reputations more than the other content-free writing style features. Whereas, according 
to Table  7, the results of pairwise t tests on accuracy for different classification tech-
niques show that there was no single classification technique that gave the best accu-
racy for all the feature sets in any given segmenting type, but ensemble learning methods 
turned out better than base learners (RQ3 is answered). The experimental results related 
to RQ2 and RQ3 indicate that both the feature set F1 + F2 + F3 + F4 and the ensemble 
learning method are respectively better for handling with a large set of writing style fea-
tures, and such common strength provided a synergy effect. In addition, the paper con-
cluded that combining two types of online user feedbacks by using portfolio approach, 
i.e. segmenting type s = portfolio, gave the better accuracy than the other segmenting 
types (RQ4 is answered). A potential explanation is that, because the suggested portfolio 
approach segments user reputations more strictly into Good and Bad classes, it is better 
able to address the problem of this study.
This paper contributes to the literature review as follows. First, this study is the first 
work that adopts writing styles as objective features to automatically classify social 
media user reputations into Good and Bad classes. Second, this paper provided guide-
lines for the system implementation in two ways: (1) which writing style features and 
classification technique should be used together for the best accuracy; (2) which seg-
menting type gave the best result with respect to accuracy. In particular, because social 
media have similar ways in measuring user reputations, which are given as the online 
user feedbacks, e.g. like, dislike, or both of two, the results can be used as a reference for 
similar studies on the other types of social media. Third, the paper helps keep the healthy 
and trustful social media ecosystem by protecting users from bad users, and it enables us 
to manage user reputations that are manipulated to be either lower or higher than the 
original values. As a consequence, it helps build the trust between users by complement-
ing the online user feedback system in social media.
Directions for further studies can be suggested based on this paper as follows. First, 
for this study, South Korea was selected as the test bed country for reasons, but differ-
ent country targets and more various languages may lead to additional implications. 
Hence, future researches for various countries, e.g. US, European, China, Japan, and Mid 
East are recommendable as the future researches. Second, this study focused on writing 
styles as objective features to classify user reputations in social media, but there can be 
other objective features useful for this study, e.g. network structures in communications 
between users and their commenters. In a similar vein, third, simpler or more sophisti-
cated approaches should be considered to tackle the computing problem that ensemble 
learning methods take a great deal of time. Thus, the further studies can be conducted 
to revisit the problems and challenging issues, which motivated this study, with different 
perspectives on countries, languages, features, and techniques.
