Abstract— Plagiarism detection has been widely discussed in 
recent years. Various approaches have been proposed such as the 
text-similarity calculation, structural-approaches, and the 
fingerprint. In fingerprint-approaches, small parts of document 
are taken to be matched with other documents. In this paper, 
fingerprint and Winnowing algorithm is proposed. Those 
algorithms are used for detecting plagiarism of scientific articles 
in Bahasa Indonesia. Plagiarism classification is determined from 
those two documents by a Dice Coefficient at a certain threshold 
value. The results showed that the best performance of 
fingerprint algorithm was 92.8% while Winnowing algorithm’s 
best performance was 91.8%. Level-of-relevance to the topic 
analysis result showed that Winnowing algorithm has got 
stronger term-correlation of 37.1% compared to the 33.6% 
fingerprint algorithm.

I.  INTRODUCTION  
Recently, plagiarism cases —especially in scientific 
writing— were on the news. This can bring down public’s 
credibility towards quality of research in an institution where 
individuals involved. Due to fast developments of information 
technology, any kind of information can be found easily 
through the internet. These information are widely abused by 
various parties which lead to plagiarism. 
Development of algorithm to detect plagiarism fraud has 
actually been proposed by other researchers. Some of the 
conventional approach to the detect of plagiarism indications 
including character-based, structural-based, cluster-based, 
syntax-based, cross-language based, and semantic-based [8]. 
Furthermore, there are some character based algorithm [8] 
such as:  
a. Fingerprint. Using parts of document to be checked to 
plagiarism. The checked parts will be proceed by certain 
mechanism (character-matching) to determine the fraud. There 
are two algorithms based on fingerprint which are fingerprint 
algorithm and winnowing algorithm [1, 9, 10]. 
b. String similarity. Using this approach overlapped 
document will be found using string-matching and sentence-
matching algorithm. This approach was developed and applied 
to COPS (copy protection system) [2]. In addition, detection 
system is also developed using Longest Common Subsequence 
(LCS) [3], Levenshtein Distance and also Smith-Waterman 
[13]. 
c. Structural-based methods. While the two previous 
approaches above focused on exploiting lexical features of a 
document, structure-matching method focused on structural 
things such as header, section, paragraph, and reference [8]. 
Tree-structure feature with POS tagging is also used in this 
study. Other approaches such as cluster-based, syntax-based, 
cross language-based and semantic-based also used by other 
researcher [8]. 
This paper is focusing on the use of fingerprint (fingerprint 
and winnowing algorithm) in document-matching. Moreover, 
at the end of the section, characterization of fingerprint and 
winnowing algorithm on plagiarism detection in Bahasa 
Indonesia documents is also stated. Characterization here 
means linkage-level of selected term as a fingerprint to the 
document’s topic. 
This research used 112 documents. Fraud documents are 
built by using paraphrase process with a 20%-80% rate and 
conversing active-passive voice.  
The plagiarism process started from document pre-
processing stage. Pre-processing steps are applied to [7]: case 
folding, parsing, filtering, stemming[11], and tokenizing. 
Document is then proceeded to obtain sequence N-Gram token 
based. This N-Gram token based is used on fingerprint and 
winnowing algorithm as an input to get certain keyword of a 
document. 
Determination of plagiarism is done by dice coefficient[6]. 
At the end of the process, detection accuracy is counted. Even 
more, resulted keyword will be analyzed to specify linkage-
level of selected term as topic’s keyword. 
II. BASIC ALGORITHM 
This study focused on the implementation of fingerprint 
and winnowing algorithm. Both algorithms are used to check a

fingerprint-technique plagiarism. The basis of the algorithms 
are described as following. 
A. Fingerprint Algorithm 
Fingerprint search [9] in a document can be done by using a 
hash function in N-Gram of a document. N-Gram is a substring 
of k length by merging symbols/tokens in a document. For 
instance, if there is a string s1 = “very intriguing”, then N-
Gram of s1 can be obtained by eliminating irrelevant 
symbols/features. By eliminating space as an irrelevant feature, 
the process will get s1’ = “veryintriguing”. 
From this s1’, if k = 3 is chosen, there will be some N-
Gram = {‘ver’, ‘ery’, ‘ryi’, … ‘ing’}. Sub-string resulted from 
those N-Gram will then be inputted into hash function. 
Particular hash value is selected which meet a hash(N-Gram) 
condition modulo p = 0. Further explanation can be seen in the 
illustration on figure 1 [9]:

(b) The text with irrelevant features removed.

(c) The sequence of 5-grams derived from the text.

72 8 88 72 
(e) The sequence of hashes selected using 0 mod 4. 
 
Figure 1.  Ilustration Fingerprint Algorithm [9] 
There are some advantages and disadvantages in the 
fingerprint-searching process written on Figure I; Advantage 
from that fingerprint algorithm is document-matching and 
document-storage can only be done in fingerprint feature only. 
This resulted partial copy of document can be detected. 
One of the disadvantages from fingerprint algorithm is 
when hash(N-Gram) mod p = 0 can find neither fingerprint. 
When this happens, document-matching process was as if a 
vain since there are no chosen fingerprint. Therefore, 
winnowing algorithm is created—to complete. 
B. Winnowing Algorithm 
Winnowing algorithm utilized fingerprint concept with the 
addition of window concept. From this window, hash value 
chosen will be the minimum fingerprint value. When there are 
more than 2 values, smallest hash value on the rightmost will 
be chosen. Steps a-d on winnowing algorithm are similar to the 
previous illustration on Figure 1. Different steps of winnowing 
algorithm are [9]:

(g) Fingerprint paired with 0-base position information. 
 
Figure 2.  Illustration Winnowing Algorithm [9] 
Chosen fingerprint (both in fingerprint and winnowing 
algorithm) is then calculated by local similarity. If we have 2 
documents A and B, this local similarity will firstly look for a 
specific fingerprint from both documents. A’s fingerprints can 
be denoted by h(A) while B’s h(B). Values of |h(A)| and |h(B)| 
are the cardinalities from document’s fingerprint which later 
will be used to count the local similarity [1].

III. DESAIN 
This study conducted a modification in hash function. The 
process used MD5 function on pre-proceed terms/sequences. 
Local similarity will not used in this study. Dice coefficient is 
used to determine plagiarism. 
A. Preprocessing Document 
Before a document is matched, it has to go through 
preprocessing steps. Preprocessing steps used in this study are: 
Case Folding, Parsing, Filtering, Stemming, Tokenizing 
Case folding: All letters have to be case-insensitive. As for 
this study, all letters are changed to lowercase [7]. Parsing 
process is needed so that textual contents of each paragraph are 
obtained. This process resulted a term in the article [7]. 
Filtering also called stop word removal. Important terms 
from previous process are decided. Unimportant terms are 
discarded so that stop list can be made[7]. 
Steming. This step reduced words into stem. For example, 
‘invented’, ‘inventor’, ‘invention’ will be reduced and changed 
into their stem, invent. Stemming algorithm used in this study 
is Porter stemmer for Bahasa Indonesia [11]. Tokenizing step 
changed words into IDs. These IDs are called tokens and later 
are used as symbol in matching process [7]. 
B. Dice Coefficient 
Matching process is done on the resulted fingerprint. This

study did not use local similarity to calculate similarity level. 
Dice coefficient is used instead. 
Calculation of document similarity between document one 
and two is counted with such Dice coefficient [6] :

C. Fingerprint Block Diagram 
In this fingerprint block diagram explain the N-Gram token 
based and MD5 position in the whole system.  Fingerprint of a 
document is selected from a divisible-by-a-certain prime-
number hash value. This fingerprint is kept and later matched 
with another document’s fingerprint. The bigger fingerprint-
similarity level is, the stronger plagiarism fraud is. Figure 3.

process.

D. Winnowing Block Diagram  
Winnowing block diagram is almost similar to the 
fingerprint block diagram. A complete block diagram for 
winnowing algorithm can be shown at Figure 4 Winnowing 
Algorithm block diagram.  
Winnowing algorithm will used a certain size of window. 
Each window resulted term as fingerprint which later stored for 
use in document matching process. The bigger fingerprint-
similarity level is, the stronger plagiarism fraud is. 
IV. DATASET AND TESTING 
Trials of both algorithms are done on the derivative dataset. 
Quantitative comparison between fingerprint and winnowing 
algorithm are done using accuracy measurement. Classification 
of term-correlation level to the topic in an article is also done in 
this study.

A. Dataset 
This study used 112 titles of faculty of informatics’ final 
projects. Fraud documents are built gradually by paraphrasing 
32 titles with the following mechanism: 
a.  Original datasets as part of fundamental theory in the final 
project is randomly chosen. To fulfill a good plagiarism 
quality, each document is only taken as many as 2 pages for 
the plagiarism. 
b. The copy-paste document of plagiarism is added 20% of 
sentences from original document (a). This sentence-adding 
process can be done by several forms: (1) In the beginning, 
(2) In the end, (3) In the middle. 
c. Paraphrasing the document (20-80%) is constructed on the 
copy-paste document (b). This paraphrasing process is built 
gradually from the lowest 20% and increased by 10% on an 
ongoing basis until 80%. 
d.  Active-passive voice change is conducted on the overall 
content of document (a). 
A total of 80 documents are still treated as original 
documents with no plagiarism done. Resume of the dataset test 
is shown on the Table I Testing Dataset:

In fingerprint algorithm, trial parameter is conducted on N-
Gram and threshold value. Number of tested N-Gram were [2, 
3, 4, 5] while on threshold value were [0.05, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 
0.25, 0.3, 0.35, 0.4, 0.45, 0.5, 0.55, 0.6, 0.65, 0.7, 0.75, 0.8,

Trial’s performance is calculated by using accuracy value. This 
is applied in the system and obtained by adding the plagiarism 
detected document with the non-plagiarism document. The 
result is then divided by total existent document. The resume 
from this fingerprint algorithm trial is shown in Table II. 
Accuracy in Fingerprint Algorithm. 
From the experiment result in Table II, fingerprint 
algorithm gave best performance at 92.8% of accuracy. This 
value was obtained from 0.1 threshold value and N-Gram score 
of 3. The graph of data from Table II is shown in Appendix A. 
From the trial result, even though highest accuracy was 
obtained from N-Gram score of 3, N-Gram score of 2 (bigram) 
showed a more stable performance. This bigram give accuracy 
value more than 80% in threshold range 0.05-0.45. The value 
of n-grams are used in the subsequent analysis is 2.  
C. Winnowing Algorithm Test Analysis 
In winnowing algorithm, trial parameter will be performed 
on the N-Gram, window size and threshold values. The 
numbers of N-Gram tested were [2, 3, 4, 5], number of the 
window size was [4, 6, 8, 10, 12] while the threshold value 
were [0.05, 0.1, 0:15, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.35, 0.4, 0.45, 0.5, 0.55, 
0.6, 0.65, 0.7, 0.75, 0.8, 0.85, 0.9].

In this study, the accuracy’s average produced by threshold 
combination was analyzed. Accuracy’s averages were grouped 
depends on N-Gram value which can be seen in Appendix B.  
From the trials, it is shown that N-Gram score of  2 
(bigram) had a better performance than any other N-Gram 
values. As for the window-size accuracy, score of 4 gave the

best performance among all. Therefore, the study focused on 
N-Gram = 2 and window-size = 4. Table III showed accuracy 
result of N-Gram = 2.  
From Table III, it can be stated that stable condition of 
winnowing algorithm had the same value as fingerprint 
algorithm, which is N-Gram = 2 with threshold range 0.05-
0.45. This condition leads to more than 80% accuracy level. 
Figure 5 indicates comparison result from both algorithms on 
stable condition.

Size = 4) Accuracy Comparation 
Figure 5 show the accuracy of winnowing algorithm is 
better than fingerprint algorithm.  
D. Term (Words) Analysis 
Analysis of term (words) is done by regarding the chosen 
term in each algorithm. Words are sorted by frequency of 
occurrence from the largest to the smallest. 30% of the frequent 
terms are selected to be analyzed. The selected term will then 
be determined whether it is a topic-specific word or just 
commonly-used word.  
TABLE IV.  TERM ANALYSIS COMPARISON FOR FINGERPRINT AND 
WINNOWING ALGORITHM 
Fingerprint Algorithm Specific General 
Distinct Term 31.7% 68.3% 
Term Frequency 33.6% 66.4% 
Winnowing Algorithm Specific General 
Distinct Term 34.7% 65.3% 
Term Frequency 37.1% 62.9% 
 
From Table IV, term-relevancy level of winnowing 
algorithm resulted a higher score than frequency or distinct 
term. By increasing the level of specific term in plagiarism 
detection, we hope that we can have better result in public’s 
credibility towards quality of a study/ research. 
V. CONCLUSION 
Based on the discussion, it can be concluded that : although 
maximum accuracy value of fingerprint algorithm is higher 
(92.8%) than winnowing algorithms’ (91.8%), winnowing 
algorithm has better and more stable performance. Winnowing 
algorithm also has a better performance in keyword-specifying 
as indicated by a higher correlation-level of fingerprint term.
