Abstract 
A crucial issue of authorship identification is to find a set of features which can represent the 
writing style of a particular author. Due to Chinese special characteristics, the features used for 
identifying Chinese authorship are relatively few. In this paper, we propose a method of Chinese 
authorship identification based on Dependency Grammar. Vector Space Model is employed to 
represent the document information, and the value of dimensions in a vector space is based on the 
frequencies of each feature occurring in each document. First, taking advantage of the dependency 
parsing technique in Natural Language Processing field, we extract 24 dependencies as the syntactic 
feature for identification. Next, we extract another three features: empty word, punctuation, and Part 
of Speech, together with dependency to comprise a large feature set. In order to get higher accuracies, 
we use Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to optimize the feature set. We conduct experiments on 
Chinese literature to examine the effectiveness of our method. Together with Support Vector Machine, 
the experimental results demonstrate that dependency is an effective feature, and PCA can provide 
much better identification performance.

1. Introduction 
 
In the typical authorship identification problem, given a set of candidate authors for whom texts of 
undisputed authorship are available, a text of unknown authorship is assigned to one candidate author 
[1]. In recent years, authorship identification has been widely applied to many applications, such as 
verify the authorship of blogs [2], emails [3] and literary works [4], and forensic cases [5]. The 
fundamental assumption of authorship identification is that each author has habits in wording that make 
their writing unique, and the key issue of authorship identification is to find these different habits, 
which are called features in this field.  
For English, the effective features are diverse, such as alphabetic characters count, digit characters 
count, uppercase and lowercase character count, letter frequencies, and punctuation marks count [1][3][6], 
which are in character-based level, function word (e.g., ”while”, ”upon”), and some content-specific 
words [1,7] in word-based level, Part of Speech (POS), and syntactic patterns [8] in syntactic-based level, 
and information about synonyms and hypernyms of the words based on WordNet [6] in semantic-based 
level. So far, compared to the research of authorship identification on English, the research on Chinese 
is relatively few. One reason is that the more complexity of the Chinese vocabulary makes the 
identifying process for Chinese more difficult. Peng, Schuurmans, Keselj, and Wang conducted 
experiments on Greek, English, and Chinese data to examine the performance of authorship 
identification across different languages [1]. They noted that the Chinese vocabulary is much larger than 
the English vocabulary, which may give rise to sparse data problems. They examined the n-gram 
language model on Greek newspaper articles, English documents, and Chinese novels. In all three 
languages, the best accuracy achieved was 90%. But the performance for Chinese writings was not as

good as that for English writings. Another important reason is that Chinese is a typical oriental 
language that differs from English on some important aspects. For instance, Chinese has no explicit 
word boundaries. Consequently, the features and feature-extraction techniques for Chinese are very 
different from those for English. Some English features, such as word length or frequency of the 26 
different English letters do not exist in Chinese. Because of the difficulties, the effective features used 
in Chinese authorship identification are relatively few, and moreover, most of the features are in the 
character-based level or word-based level. The discovery of effective features for Chinese author 
identification is still in the exploration stage. 
In this paper, we investigate methods for Chinese authorship identification using Chinese literatures 
as the data set. Based on Dependency Grammar, we proposed dependency as a new syntactic-based 
level feature. In addition to dependency, we also extract another three features: empty word [9], 
punctuation [10], and POS [10], which have proved to be effective for Chinese authorship identification. 
We combined these features (including dependency) together to construct a feature set , and then 
employ PCA to do the job of feature reduction hoping to obtain better identification ability. Together 
with Support Vector Machine (SVM) for authorship categorization, we study the effectiveness of our 
proposed method. 
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the related notations and 
technologies used in our proposed method. The proposed method of authorship identification based on 
dependency grammar is described in detail in Section 3. The experimental results and analysis are 
given in section 4. Section 5 concludes the paper. 
 
2. Principles of the Proposed Method 
 
In this section, we will discuss some related technologies such as Dependency Grammar, 
PCA, and SVM, which are employed in the proposed method. 
 
2.1. Dependency Grammar 
 
Dependency Grammar was first proposed by the French linguist L.Tesniere [11]. It can be 
applied to the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) to make the machines such as 
computers to access the semantics of a sentence by dependency analysis. In Dependency 
Grammar, words contract binary, asymmetrical governor-dependent relationships, which are 
called dependencies. Informally and roughly put, a dependency-based perspective is constituted 
by distinguishing a head/dependent asymmetry, and describing the relations between a head and 
its dependents in terms of semantically motivated dependency relations. Dependency Grammar 
describes the direct syntactic relationship between words or sentences. In the 20th century, 
Chinese scholars began to apply the analysis method of Dependency Grammar to Chinese corpus 
linguistics research. To get more details about Dependency Grammar, you can see reference 
[11,12]. 
 
2.2. Principal Component Analysis 
 
PCA is usually used in text classification for feature reduction [13-16]. It is a mathematical procedure 
that uses an orthogonal transformation to convert a set of observations of possibly correlated variables 
into a set of values of uncorrelated variables called principal components. The number of principal 
components is less than or equal to the number of original variables. This transformation is defined in 
such a way that the first principal component has as high a variance as possible (that is, accounts for as 
much of the variability in the data as possible), and each succeeding component in turn has the highest 
variance possible under the constraint that it be orthogonal to (uncorrelated with) the preceding 
components.

2.3. Support Vector Machine Classifier 
 
An SVM is a novel learning machine first introduced by Vapnik [17]. The idea of the SVM is 
to find a model for which we can guarantee the lowest true error by controlling the model 
complexity. This avoids over-fitting, which is the main problem for other learning algorithm 
[18-20]. Due to its distinctive advantage of the ability of processing many high dimensional 
applications, it has been widely used in text classification and authorship identification, and the 
experimental results were ideal. So in this study, we adopt SVM algorithm as learning 
algorithm. 
 
3. The Proposed Method 
 
  In this section, we describe authorship identification based on dependency grammar in 
detail. A framework of our method is shown in Figure 1. In the proposed method, the authorship 
identification process is divided into four steps.

Step 1. Data Collection: In order to profile the writing styles of each potential author, 
investigators need to collect a set of writings written by these authors. For generating authorship 
identification model afterwards, we split these texts into two subsets: training texts and testing 
texts. 
Step 2. Feature Extraction: Based on the predefined writing-style features, the feature 
extractor can analyze the texts and extract the features in these texts. After this step, each text is 
represented as a vector of writing-style features. 
Step 3. Feature Optimization: From step 2, according to the predefined features, we get some 
high-dimensional feature vectors. Since a high-dimensional feature vector usually contains some 
useless features which will affect the identification performance, in this step, a feature optimizer 
is proposed to do the job of feature reduction and optimization. This step generates a set of 
optimized feature vectors. 
Step 4. Identification: The training vectors are used to train the classification model, and the 
classification techniques applied in this process may lead to models with different predictive 
powers. The testing vectors are used to validate the prediction power of the authorship 
identification model. If the performance of the classifier is verified by the testing vectors, it can 
be used to identify the authorship of a new disputed text. After the authorship identification 
model is developed, it can be used to predict the authorship of unknown texts. 
 
3.1. Feature Set 
 
A feature set is composed of the features which are able to represent the writing style of the 
authors, and these features are predefined by researchers. In this study, we use four types of 
features: 
Syntax is the form of the texts. In order to express the same or similar semantics, different 
people attend to use different syntactic structures. Since the dependencies reflect the syntactic 
relationship between words and sentences, which can be seen as the writing style of a particular 
author, we decide to use dependency based on Dependency Grammar in the research of 
authorship identification. There are 24 items predefined by the dependency parser, which is used 
to do the syntactic parsing job. 
Besides the syntactic feature, we use another three types of features proposed in previous 
studies: 
Character-based level: We use the punctuation marks count as a kind of feature in this level. 
The items contained in this type of feature are the 9 most frequently used Chinese punctuations. 
Word-based level: In this level, we employ empty word as the feature. Empty word is a kind 
of meaningless and content-free word in Chinese texts, whose occurrences are not related to the 
content of the texts. For example, in a sentence “Economic news had little effect on financial 
markets.”, the word “on” can be seemed as an empty word. The empty word includes adverb, 
preposition, conjunction, particle and interjection. Compared to the empty word, the content 
words are generally not distinct for distinguishing the style of different authors, as two authors 
writing on the same topic would probably share many words and phrases in most cases. Due to 
this, the words used as features for authorship identification usually are the content-free words 
[1]. The items contained in this type of feature are 881 empty words chosen from the Modern 
Chinese Empty Word Dictionary.  
Syntactic level: We choose POS tag as a kind of syntactic feature. There are 46 items 
predefined by the POS tagger, which is used to assign a tag of syntactic information to each 
word-token based on contextual information. 
We integrate dependency, empty word, punctuation, and POS into the feature set. The total 
feature items are 960. See Table 1.

Total 960  
 
3.2. Feature Extractor 
 
  In this study, we developed an automated multiple-features extractor for Chinese 
authorship identification. The feature extractor is composed of two modules: one is the analysis 
module, which is used to do the job of lexical analysis and syntactic analysis, and another is the 
calculation module, which is used to obtain the occurrences of each items contained in each kind 
of feature and to do the normalization job. See Figure 2. The two modules are described in detail 
as follows.

  (1) Analysis module: We integrated Chinese Lexical Analysis System (ICTCLAS, 
http://ictclas.org/), which was developed by Institute of Computing Technology Chinese 
Academy of Science, and the Linguistic Process module (LP, http://ir.hit.edu.cn/demo/ltp/), 
which was developed by the Information Retrieval Laboratory of Harbin Institute Technology 
University, into the analysis module. ICTCLAS includes word segmentation, POS tagging and 
unknown words recognition. Its segmentation precision is 98.45%. 
We employ ICTCLAS to do the lexical analysis job. For a text, through the function of word 
segmentation and POS tagging, a processed text is generated. From this text, we can get the 
information about empty words, punctuations, and POS tags. 
To obtain the dependencies of an article, we employ the LP module to do the syntactic 
analysis job. The LP module is comprised of several modules, such as the SplitSentence 
(Sentence Splitting) module, the IRLAS (Lexical Analysis System) module, the PosTag 
(Part-of-speech Tagging) module, the Parser (Dependency Parsing) module, etc. The Parser 
module dose the dependency parsing job. It defines 24 dependencies. Table 2 gives the tags of 
these dependencies. In Figure 3, we give an example of dependency structure obtained by the 
Parser module for a Chinese sentence (which has the same meaning of Economic news had little 
effect on financial markets). The characters ‘n’ (noun), ‘p’ (preposition), ‘v’ (verb), and ‘d’ 
(adverb) represent Part of Speech of each word. The red characters represent the tags of

dependencies, which can be found in Table 2. For an article written by an author, we can get the 
dependencies by the dependency parser, and the dependencies are seemed as the features, which 
represent the writing style of this author. After the process of the dependency parsing, we get the 
parsed texts.

(2) Calculation module: This module is developed for doing the calculation job. From the processed 
text, which is the output of the analysis module, first, we count the occurrences of each item contained 
in each type of feature. Then, we adopt Vector Space Model (VSM) to represent the feature 
information of each article. In this way, for each parsed text, we can obtain a feature vector, and the 
value of dimensions is the frequencies of each item. Considering that the occurrences of the items are 
related to the size of the texts, and in order to eliminate effects caused by the length of the texts, last, 
we use a normalized method to process these feature vectors. In order to maintain the ratio between the 
various items unchanged and to eliminate the effect of the length of the different texts on the 
identification performance, the normalized method called ratio normalization [7] is employed. It is 
described as follows: 
Given a vector ),,,( 21 Nxxxx ¼¼=  (N denotes the numbers of items), defines a normalized 
vector ),,,( 21 Nxxxx

¼¼= , where

In this way, for each text, we obtain a vector in a high-dimensional vector space where the 
value of dimensions is the normalized frequencies of each item by our proposed feature 
extractor.

3.3. Feature Optimizer 
 
In authorship identification research, a high-dimensional feature vector usually contains some 
useless features called noises which will affect the identification performance. In order to 
remove these noises and optimize the feature set to obtain better results, we developed a feature 
optimizer for feature reduction and optimization.  
We assume that we have n observations (sample texts), each being a realization of the 
p-dimensional random variable ),...,,( 21 pFFFF = . Here, variable iF  is called a feature item. 
We denote the value of the i’th feature item iF  of the j’th sample text as jif , , where pi ££1 , 
nj ££1 . Thus, the observation matrix may be defined as pnjif ´)( , . 
The mean of the i’th feature iF  is given by

The correlation coefficient can measure the degree of linear association between two feature

follows:

whose variance are greater than 0, then the value of k is assigned to m. 
5. Return the set of optimized feature items },...,,{ 21 mPPPP = . 
 
3.4. Classification 
 
There are some free SVM tools available. We adopt libsvm as the classification tool. Libsvm 
is implemented by Chang and Lin [21]. It is simple, easy to use, and efficient for SVM 
classification and regression. Its goal is to let users can easily use SVM as a tool. We use the 
easy.py command to build the authorship identification model. To get more details, you can see 
reference [22].

4. Experimental Results and Analysis 
 
4.1. Data Collection 
 
We downloaded 416 modern Chinese literatures of 9 authors from the internet. These authors 
are the famous writers in China, and the literatures of these authors have been chosen in the 
previous research on Chinese authorship identification. The genre of these literature included 
prose, notes, and novel. Table 3 showed the detailed information.

4.2. Experimental Design 
 
To examine the effectiveness of our method, we designed two experiments. For each author, we 
randomly chose the training samples and the testing samples, as showed in table 2. In our experiments, 
we chose the samples of every two different authors to comprise a group. In this way, as there were 9 
authors, we got 36 groups in total (We used numbers: 1, 2, …… , 36 to represent these groups). For 
each group, together with libsvm [18], we did the identification process to see the effectiveness of our 
method.  
To evaluate the prediction, we used the accuracy measure [1], which has been commonly adopted in 
data mining and authorship identification. Accuracy indicates the overall prediction of a particular 
classifier, which is defined as: tna /= , where a denotes accuracy, n denotes number of articles whose 
author is correctly identified, and t denotes total number of articles to be identified. 
Experiment 1: The effectiveness of dependency and the feature set. 
We used dependency alone as the feature first, then we combined dependency with another 
three features (empty word, punctuation, and POS) respectively, to do the identification tests. 
Figure 4, Figure 5, and Figure 6 gave the experimental results. Figure 4 showed that after 
combining dependency with empty word, the results were better than using dependency or 
empty word alone. Figure 5 showed that after combining dependency with punctuation, the 
results were better than using dependency or punctuation alone, and Figure 6 showed that after 
combining dependency with POS, the results were better than using dependency or POS alone.

There is no agreement on a best set of features for a wide range of application domains, and it 
is also generally accepted that the performance of authorship identification depends on the 
combination of the selected features [1]. In order to obtain better results, we combined all four 
type features together (960 features in total) to form a large feature set. The experimental results 
were showed in Figure 7. We can see that the performance was better by combining all features 
together overall.

This experiment demonstrated that dependency is an effective feature which has a good 
discriminating power and is helpful for improving the accuracy by combining with other 
features. 
Experiment 2: The effectiveness of PCA. 
Generally speaking, the larger feature set may provide the better identification performance. 
Attempting to get better results, we combined four kinds of features together. But in some 
groups, we got worse results, as shown in Figure 7. The reason is that a large feature sets usually 
contain some noises which will affect the identification accuracy. In order to fix it, we applied 
PCA in our feature optimizer to the groups to see its effectiveness of removing noises to 
improve the identification performance. Figure 8 showed the results. We can see from Figure 8 
that much better results were obtained after employing PCA to the groups.

Figure 8. Comparisons of the identification accuracy of using four kinds of features before 
employing PCA and after employing PCA 
 
This experiment demonstrated that high-dimensional feature vector would contain noises to 
bring about the decline of accuracy, and the experimental results showed that PCA can 
implement the feature set optimization effectively. 
From the experimental results above, we improved that the effectiveness of our proposed 
method, including the effectiveness of the features based on dependency grammar and the 
feature optimization process based on PCA. 
 
5. Conclusion 
 
In this study, we employed dependency analysis in NLP for Chinese authorship identification. 
Through dependency analysis, we got 24 dependencies to represent writing style of different 
authors. The experimental results of 36 groups showed that dependency is an effective feature.

With the development of dependency analysis technique, we believe that the performance of 
identification will be much better. Meanwhile, combining empty word, punctuation, POS, and 
dependency together, we obtained better results for many groups. For some decline groups, we 
applied PCA to remove noises contained in the feature set, and the experimental results showed 
that PCA can used effectively for dimension optimization to improve performance of Chinese 
authorship identification.
