Abstract 
The aim of this thesis is to understand how genre is instantiated on the web, and thereby 
to develop automatic methods for genre identification in web pages. The main 
challenges arise from the interaction of three factors: (1) the complexity of web pages, 
(2) the fluidity and the fast-paced evolution of the web, and (3) the limitation of 
automatically-extractable features for genre detection. First, genres on the web are 
instantiated in web pages, which, from a physical, linguistic and textual point of view, 
can be considered documents of a new type, much more unpredictable and 
individualised than documents on paper. Second, the web is unstable and fluid, 
undergoing a fast-paced evolution, so genre identification is influenced by phenomena 
such as the formation of novel genres, genre hybridism, individualisation, and intra-
genre and inter-genre variation. Finally, automatically-extractable features represent a 
poor surrogate for potentially useful genre-revealing features. These three factors 
strongly affect the automatic identification of genre in web pages. Previous work has 
disregarded them for the sake of practicality, and built on the oversimplifying 
assumption that a web page is to be assigned to only one genre, relying as little as 
possible on the linguistic features returned by NLP tools. By contrast, this thesis argues 
for the necessity of a more flexible genre classification scheme, capable of assigning 
zero, one or multiple genre labels, and builds as much as possible on the output of NLP 
tools. A series of empirical studies is presented which investigate (i) why a zero-to-
multi genre classification scheme would be more appropriate for classifying web pages, 
and (ii) to what extent it is possible to implement this scheme in an automatic system. A 
new model of zero-to-multi-genre classification is presented that combines several 
traditions, incorporating findings from automatic genre classification, corpus linguistics, 
genre analysis, textlinguistics and artificial intelligence. This model offers a more 
articulated view of genres in web pages. Although such a model cannot be fully 
evaluated, given the limitations of the current state of genre research, experimental 
results show that its accuracy on single-genre classification is competitive: about 86% 
vs. 90% for a standard machine-learning model, in ideal conditions; and about 86% vs. 
76% in more realistic conditions.

Material Availability and Typographic 
Conventions 
In order to ensure replicability, all materials used in the experiments described in this 
thesis, including web page collections, feature sets and the manual evaluations, are 
available online and downloadable from my personal home page at University of 
Brighton (UK): <http://www.nltg.brighton.ac.uk/home/Marina.Santini/>. 
A CD is attached to this thesis containing the most important parts of the code created 
for this research, some datasets and my manual evaluations of some experiments. 
In the thesis I followed a few typographic conventions. I used the SMALL CAPS font to 
indicate genres (e.g. EDITORIAL, BLOG, etc.). I employed the SMALL CAPS + ITALIC fonts 
to indicate text types (e.g. NARRATION, INSTRUCTION, etc.). I used the double quotes (“”) 
to indicate that the enclosed text is a citation, or a term as interpreted by specific authors 
(e.g. the terms “stylistic genres” in Chapter 2). I used the single quotes (‘’) to indicate 
the use of metalanguage (e.g. ‘genre’, ‘register’, ‘text types’, ‘style’, and ‘domain’ in 
Chapter 2). Similarly, the use of italics indicates the introduction of a new expression 
that has a special meaning in the thesis (e.g. the open web in Chapter 1).

Preface 
Standing on the shoulders of giants? 
 It’s hard with wobbly legs... 
  
Though recent, the web has influenced many aspects in our life, for instance how we 
communicate with other users, how we use language, how we write documents, how we 
disseminate, search and select information. The web can be seen from many different 
angles, but from a textual point of view, it is a huge reservoir of documents. On the web 
virtually everything can be seen as a ‘document’ or better a ‘web page’. The sheer 
number of texts available is simply overwhelming, even for a single language. 
Furthermore, it is mainly wild and uncontrolled. This becomes clear if we make a 
comparison between a ‘tamed’ resource of the paper world like the British National 
Library and the ‘untamed’ electronic English web. All the knowledge conveyed by the 
classification systems of library catalogues is just nonexistent on the web.  
There are different kinds of classification. Classification by topic, by themes, by author 
and so on. As a web user, I still feel very frustrated when I cannot specify the ‘type of 
information’ I am looking for. A REVIEW article on a product is different from a 
MANUAL on the same product. If I type review Windows in a search engine, I get all 
sorts of hits where ‘review’ is a verb and a noun with several senses. If I write manual 
Windows, I get many web pages instructing on how to install a Windows manual. It 
would be nice if I could specify which ‘type of information’ I am interested in, because 
keywords can be ambiguous, broad or misleading.  
This problem aroused my curiosity. Thinking over a little, I realized that ‘the type of 
information’ I was looking for was nothing more than the genre of web pages. This was 
the trigger of my research. Then, I started asking questions...

Chapter 1.  Introduction 
This thesis is about statistical and computational methods for the identification of genre 
in web pages. More specifically, it proposes a simple corpus-based probabilistic model 
that supports automatic genre analysis, and a flexible genre classification scheme. This 
chapter explains the aim of the thesis and summarizes the main claims. It also presents 
the motivation for a flexible genre classification scheme. The chapter ends by 
overviewing the structure of the thesis. 
1.1 Aim of the Thesis 
The importance of automatic genre identification has been widely acknowledged for a 
variety of tasks related to digital or web environments, and for problems that Natural 
Language Processing (NLP) is concerned with. Since manual annotation is expensive 
and time-consuming, automatic genre identification is useful for information retrieval 
(as highlighted by Karlgren and Cutting, 1994; Kessler et al, 1997, Stamatatos et al., 
2000; Meyer zu Eissen and Stein, 2004; Lim et al., 2005b), digital libraries (as noted by 
Rauber and Müller-Kögler, 2001), information extraction (as stressed by Maynard et al., 
2001), and so forth. Apart from the benefits that it could bring to web-related 
applications, automatic identification of genres could be particularly helpful for testing 
parsers, taggers and word sense disambiguation methods. For example, as pointed out 
by Kessler et al. (1997), parsing accuracy could be increased if parsers were tested on 
different genres, as certain constructions may occur only in certain types of texts. The 
same is true for Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging and word sense disambiguation. More 
accurate NLP tools could in turn be beneficial for automatic genre identification, 
because many features used for this task – like parts of speech and syntactic 
constructions – are extracted from the output of taggers and parsers.  
Chapter 1 - Introduction 
 3
However, genre is a difficult concept to pin down and automatic classification by genre 
is difficult because genres are heterogeneous categories. Although a considerable 
amount of research has already been done in automatic genre classification, most 
previous work has considered genres as mutually exclusive categories, disregarding the 
fact that many documents, and in particular many web pages, cannot be fitted into a 
single genre. This approach has been taken for the sake of practicality, but proves 
inadequate when dealing with complex documents, like web pages. 
The aim of the research presented in this thesis is to contribute towards the development 
of automatic methods that are more flexible and informative than merely assigning a 
single genre label to a web page. This research has been carried out on web pages 
written in English. 
More specifically, my investigations focus on the interaction of three factors that are 
crucial for the automatic identification of genres on the web: (1) the complexity of web 
pages, (2) the fluidity and the fast-paced evolution of the web, and (3) the limitation of 
automatically-extractable features. First, genres on the web are instantiated in web 
pages, which, from a physical, linguistic and textual point of view, can be considered 
documents of a new type, much more unpredictable and individualised than documents 
on paper. Second, the web is unstable and fluid, undergoing a fast-paced evolution, so 
genre identification is influenced by phenomena such as the formation of novel genres, 
genre hybridism, individualisation, and intra-genre and inter-genre variation. Finally, 
automatically-extractable features represent a poor surrogate for potentially useful 
genre-revealing features, and this limitation strongly affects the efficiency of any 
automatic approach to genre detection.  
Unlike most previous work on automatic genre classification, I do not build on the 
oversimplifying assumptions that a web page is to be assigned to only one genre, and 
that automatic genre detection should rely solely on surface cues, bypassing the help of 
any NLP tools. Instead, I propose a more flexible genre classification scheme based on 
an articulated genre analysis, capable of returning zero, one or multiple genre labels, by 
leveraging on the linguistic features returned by NLP tools.  
Chapter 1 - Introduction 
 4
This scheme relies on the observation – put forward by Werlich and other textlinguists1, 
and confirmed by genre-specific analyses – that genres are characterized by recurrent or 
predominant text types. As I later explain, text types are linguistic devices expressing 
the purpose of communication. Textlinguists and some genre analysts (for example, 
Paltridge, 1996) use text types to analyse genres. However, textlinguistics and genre 
analysis mostly lack corpus-based evidence and are not computational. For this reason, I 
propose exploiting the observations about the relation between text types and genre, and 
test them using a corpus-based approach, enlarging the range of automatically-
extractable features, and implementing statistical and computational methods that 
incorporate findings from neighbouring fields, such as automatic genre classification, 
textlinguistics, corpus-linguistics, and genre analysis. Biber has already implemented a 
corpus-based approach to automatic text type identification (e.g. Biber, 1988, 1989, 
1993), but his methodology focuses on text type detection across genres rather than on 
automatic genre identification within the individual document. 
The use of text types to carry out genre analysis offers several advantages. The main 
advantage is that, in addition to the single-genre assignment, text types support two 
other assignments explained in more detail later: a zero-genre assignment and multi-
genre assignment. My suggestion is that a zero-to-multi-genre classification scheme is 
more suitable for the current situation of genres on the web, where it is often difficult to 
fit a web page into a single genre. 
1.2 Claims 
This thesis puts forward three main claims. The first is that two factors affect genre 
identification on the web: (1) the complexity of web pages, and (2) the fluidity and the 
                                                 
1 Generally speaking, the term ‘textlinguistics’ is used to indicate that the object of linguistic analysis is 
the whole text rather than isolated sentences or clauses. The analysis may be grammatical, semantic or 
pragmatic, but it always seeks to take into account texts as wholes rather than sentences in isolation.  
Egon Werlich (e.g. Werlich, 1976), Robert Longacre (e.g. Longacre, 1976, 1983), M.A.K. Halliday (e.g. 
Halliday and Kirkwood, 1973, 1978) and Robert de Beaugrande and Wolfgang Dressler (e.g. Beaugrande 
and Dressler, 1981) represent different approaches to textlinguistics, but all can be referred to as 
‘textlinguists’. 
Chapter 1 - Introduction

fast-paced evolution of the web. These two factors are closely related and result in 
classification hurdles, because many web pages have more than one genre or none at all. 
I underpin these observations with the findings of two experiments (see Part III. Web 
Evolution and Web Page Complexity).  
The second claim is that automatically-extractable genre-revealing features should 
include features returned by NLP tools. Although automatically-extractable features are 
limited if compared with the quantity and the quality of the features that a human genre 
analyst could detect in a document, they can nonetheless be extended and profitably 
used. A series of experiments (see Part II. Automatically-Extractable Genre-Revealing 
Features) shows promising results coming from the expansion of automatically-
extractable feature sets using NLP tools. 
The third claim is that linguistic insights contribute to a flexible genre classification 
scheme. As standard approaches to automatic genre classification do not offer the 
degree of flexibility needed for the automatic identification of genre in web pages, I 
suggest combining linguistic insights from previous studies (both theoretical and 
empirical) into a simple probabilistic model already used in artificial intelligence. This 
model overcomes the single-genre assumption, and supports an articulated corpus-based 
textual analysis, despite the limitation of automatically-extractable genre-revealing 
features (see Part IV. Automatic Identification of Genre in Web Pages). The main 
drawback of such a system is that it cannot be fully evaluated given the current state of 
corpus-based genre research. 
In the following section I refer to previous work and to personal observations to justify 
these three claims. 
1.3 Motivation 
Genre is a complex concept, heterogeneous and difficult to pin down in its entirety. 
Many interpretations have been proposed since Aristotle’s Poetics. The term is now 
established and generally understood, at least intuitively, but difficulties still arise when 
Chapter 1 - Introduction 
 6
it is applied to the task of genre identification. In the following subsections, I will point 
out some factors that affect the identification of genres in web pages.  
1.3.1 Genre of Web Pages 
Web page complexity. A web page appears to be a composite type of document, with a 
visual organization of the space (cf. Johnsen, 2000), where different communicative 
purposes and several functions are included at the same time.  
Textual complexity is not an exclusive trait of web pages. For example, the 
interweaving of visual and verbal is common in magazine covers, as highlighted by 
Held (2005). What is new is the widespread use of composite and complex web pages. 
For example, the space on a web page is often divided into different sections, organized 
by lists of links – mainly isolated noun structures or verbal elements, as reported by 
Haas and Grams, (2000: 186-187) – and snippets of text scattered around the main body 
of the document – like navigational buttons, menus, ads, and search boxes – that are 
visually dislocated in different areas of a single page. Additionally, hyperlinking 
(studied by Crowston and Williams, 1999; Haas and Grams, 1998; Jucker, 2002), 
interactivity and multi-functionality (analysed by Shepherd and Watters, 1999) affect 
the textuality of web pages, which also heavily rely on the use of images and other 
graphical elements. Although the use of fonts of different types, sizes, and colours, as 
well as the use of formatting devices – like columns, lines separating different sections 
of a document, pictures, etc. – has a long-standing tradition (Waller, 1987), a 
NEWSPAPER ARTICLE organized in columns and headlines does not lose its specific 
linguistic and textual characteristics when included in a corpus such as the British 
National Corpus (BNC). The same is not true for many web pages, since the visual 
structure of a web page incorporating a NEWSPAPER ARTICLE in most cases cannot be 
flattened out or ignored without losing important information, as noted by Watters and 
Shepherd (1997).  
Hence, a web page can be considered as a sort of container of multiple texts – so much 
so that in coding the pages of their sample, Haas and Grams (2000) repeatedly 
Chapter 1 - Introduction 
 7
encountered pages that could be interpreted as comprising several textual components. 
Solutions such as the artificial separation of what is considered the main body from the 
rest would be an arbitrary operation and would not make sense in many cases, for 
example for web pages similar to those shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. In brief, in a 
web page, not all the elements necessarily belong together, but they all contribute to 
form a whole, even without any linear progression.  
 
 
 
Figure 1. An example of web page 
 
As highlighted by Furuta and Marshall (1996), the complexity of web pages can be 
explained by the flexibility provided by HTML and the simplicity of such a language 
that allows the creation of more complex texts without much effort or expertise. 
The textual complexity of web pages also accounts for the ‘malleability’ of genre. As 
Yates and Orlikowski (1992) and others have stressed, genres are rarely homogeneous. 
On the contrary, they tend to overlap and mix. In an open communication space like the 
web, where many communities meet, each with its own genre system and repertoire (cf. 
Crowston and Williams, 2000), phenomena such as genre colonization (cf. Beghtol, 
2001; for an example, see page 202), genre combination (cf. Østerlund, 2006) and genre 
contamination, common also in other environments, are likely to occur.  
Chapter 1 - Introduction

Figure 2. Another example of web page 
 
For all these reasons, web pages often are more unpredictable and difficult to sort into a 
single genre than documents in other media, where social rigidity, work practices or 
stable settings favour more controlled and standardized text production (Yates and 
Sumner, 1997).  
In this thesis, these observations are confirmed by a user study set up with human 
subjects that shows to what extent web users agree on assigning a single genre label to 
web pages (Chapter 8). I interpret the large disagreement on a single genre assignment 
as a motivation for a zero-to-multi-genre classification scheme. 
The fluidity and the fast-paced evolution of the web. Concurrently with web page 
complexity, another factor must be taken into account, namely the fluidity and fast-
paced evolution of the web. First, the web is a recent communication medium, invented 
only a few decades ago2. Being so recent, it is still fluid and unstable. In addition, it is 
                                                 
2 The World Wide Web began life in 1989 at CERN, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics in 
Geneva, Switzerland. Tim Berners-Lee is the inventor of the Web (see 
<http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/book4/ch02.html>). 
Chapter 1 - Introduction

evolving at a fast pace owing to continuous injection of new web technologies. In such 
an environment, the modification of existing genres or the creation of new ones, which 
better satisfy the communication needs brought about by the new conditions, are 
common phenomena.  
The influence of a new communication medium on genre evolution has been asserted 
and analysed in a digital organizational environment by Yates and Orlikowski (1992). 
On the web the process is similar. As shown by Crowston and Williams (2000)3, who 
were among the first to study the development of genres on the web, the web has had a 
substantial impact on the genre repertoire. In their survey, they document the genres in 
use on the web by sampling and classifying randomly selected web pages in 1996. They 
identify four types of genres: reproduced genres, adapted genres, novel genres and 
unclassified web pages (Table 1). 
1. Reproduced genres: 60.6% 3. Novel genres: 5.3% 
2. Adapted genres: 28.6% 4. Unclassified web pages: 5.6% 
 
Table 1. Genres on the web, from Crowston and Williams (2000) 
Predictably, most genres derive from previous traditions. As already pointed out by 
Yates and Orlikowski (1992) and Askehave and Nielsen (2004), when moving to a new 
medium, it is normal to use forms available in existing media, before elaborating new 
ones, more tailored to the specific characteristics of the new medium. Most genres on 
the web in 1996 were still borrowed (reproduced genres) from other media, while a 
fairly large proportion appears to be adapted (adapted genres) to the needs and 
capability of the new medium. Interestingly, in the survey an equal number of novel 
genres and unclassified web pages are recorded. Even if the proportions could slightly 
                                                 
3 Crowston and Williams (1997) and Crowston and Williams (2000) are two variants on the same study. 
The main difference between the two versions is the sample: in Crowston and Williams (1997) the sample 
includes 100 web pages in English, while in Crowston and Williams (2000) the sample is of 1,000 (but 
only 837 were included in the final counts) in different languages. I will mostly refer to Crowston and 
Williams (2000) because it describes a larger web page sample. 
Chapter 1 - Introduction 
 10
vary across the different genre typologies according to different criteria of assessment4, 
it is nonetheless interesting that novel genres and unclassified web pages have a similar 
proportion, because they can be interpreted as the most advanced manifestations of 
genre evolution. More precisely, as noted by Crowston and Williams (2000), novel 
genres (namely, HOME PAGE, HOTLISTS, PAGES ABOUT WEB SERVERS, and INTERACTIVE 
PAGES) serve communicative purposes unique to the web, while some of the 
unclassified pages may be seen as examples of genres in the process of adaptation to the 
web or, in other words, as genres still emerging and not fully formed. From this survey, 
the web appears a highly dynamic genre repertoire, where changes are still under way 
and have not coalesced yet. 
The interpretation of genre evolution on the web by Shepherd and Watters (1998) is 
similar. Shepherd and Watters (1998) coined a special name, “cybergenre”, to designate 
genres in the new medium. Cybergenre is characterized by the triple <content, form, 
functionality>, where the first two elements are common to traditional genres, while 
functionality refers exclusively to the capabilities offered by the web. Shepherd and 
Watters (1998) propose a hierarchical taxonomy that accounts for the evolution of 
genres on the web. The driving force behind genre evolution on the web is, in their 
view, the functionality attribute afforded by the new medium. According to the level of 
functionality they show, cybergenres can be extant (i.e. based on existing genres) or 
novel (i.e. not like any existing genre in any other medium). Extant genres can be 
replicated, i.e. based on genres existing in other media, or variant, i.e. a modification of 
existing genres. Novel genres can be emergent, i.e. derived but significantly different 
from existing genres, or spontaneous, i.e. never employed in other media. As 
mentionded, the key evolutionary aspect is the functionality attribute, which is 
illustrated by two examples, the NEWS cybergenre and the MATH DICTIONARY 
cybergenre. Shepherd and Watters (1999) extend the exemplification with a survery. In 
their survey of 96 complete websites (and not individual web pages as in Crowston and 
                                                 
4 There are several criteria for assessing novel genres. For example, Crowston and Williams (2000) 
considered FAQs to be a reproduced genre, while in Shepherd and Watters (1998), this genre is 
mentioned as an example of novel and spontaneous genres.  
Chapter 1 - Introduction 
 11
Williams, 2000), they identify five cybergenres out of the six they had in their genre 
palette5 (namely, HOME PAGE, BROCHURE, RESOURCE, CATALOGUE, SEARCH ENGINE, and 
GAME). Each of these cybergenres show a different level of functionality, defined in 
terms of “browsing”, “email facility”, “search”, “discussion”, “interaction, email 
ordering and enquiring”, “online ordering”, “online enquiring”, “interactivity”, and 
“collaborative computing”6. Illuminatingly, Shepherd and Watters (1998, 1989) 
emphasize that functionality has caused a leap in genre evolution creating a new 
species, the cybergenre. However, they assume that a web page instantiates only a 
single cybergenre. This assumption is clear in their practical experiments – Shepherd et 
al. (2004) and Kennedy and Shepherd (2005) – where they carry out single-label genre 
classification of HOME PAGES. 
Crowston and Williams (2000) and Shepherd and Watters (1998, 1999) use 
complementary classification schemes. On one side, Shepherd and Watters (1998, 1999) 
never mention unclassified web pages, while Crowston and Williams (2000) 
realistically find them in their sample, and consequently include them in their 
classification report. On the other side, Crowston and Williams (2000), drawing on 
Yates and Orlikowski (1992)7, suggest that new genres are mostly derived from earlier 
genres that might have seemed appropriate to the situation, while Shepherd and Watters 
(1998, 1999) introduce the typology of spontaneous cybergenres, which do not have any 
counterpart in any other media. By combining the two classification schemes, the one 
by Shepherd and Watters (1998, 1999), and the other by Crowston and Williams (2000), 
we get a wider range of genre types on the web: 1) reproduced/replicated genres, 2) 
adapted/variant genres, 3) emergent/novel genres, 4) spontaneous genres, and 5) 
unclassified web pages. 
                                                 
5 The expression ‘genre palette’ is widely used in automatic genre identification studies. A genre palette is 
the set of genres included in a collection of documents (cf. Dewe et al., 1998; Karlgren, 2000) or in a user 
study (cf. Rosso, 2005: 67 ff.). 
6 Functionality has raised much interest in recent years. Cf. also the Workshop on Virtual Documents, 
Hypertext Functionality and the Web held in 1999 (<http://www.cs.unibo.it/~fabio/VD99/index.html>) 
within the Eighth International World Wide Web Conference. 
7 Other genre theorists, like Todorov (1990-1978) have the same opinion. 
Chapter 1 - Introduction 
 12
However, together with the functionality attribute suggested by Shepherd and Watters 
(1998, 1999), there is another important attribute that characterizes genres on the web: 
the use of hypertext and HTML.  
For Askehave and Nielsen (2004, 2005) the use of hypertext has created a new way of 
reading, hypertext reading. They introduce the concept of “modal shift” between 
reading mode and navigating mode for analysing the HOME PAGE genre, thus 
inaugurating the two-dimensional perspective on genre analysis. 
For Rehm (2006) different types of hypertexts can be conceptualised as individual 
hypertext types. Each “hypertext type” corresponds to a “web genre”. This leads to the 
equation one website = one web genre, where an entire website (including 
one or more pages), and not an individual web page, is used as a unit of analysis. From 
an evolutionary point of view, Rehm distinguishes between automatically converted and 
manually prepared HTML documents. The influence of the genre on the automatic 
conversion of existing paper documents is straightforward and the conversion process 
does not significantly alter the genre itself, so that we can assume that a document’s 
original genre is directly transferred into the web. By contrast, the evolutionary 
processes that shape and form genre with regard to the manual creation of websites is 
more complicated, and includes four phases: production, modification, change and 
reception. Rehm’s assumption is that when building a website with a specific web 
genre, an author incorporates, consciously or unconsciously, elements of related 
websites. Over a period of time, this process generates web specific conventions and 
rules that authors choose to apply, extend or break. In other words, Rehm suggests that 
the process of imitation maintains stability in the genre repertoire, while change is 
determined by the extension or the breaking of conventions. This view complies with 
Bakhtin’s interpretation of language, where there is always a tension between 
centripetal forces, allowing the continuity of communication, and centrifugal forces, 
allowing change and evolution (Bakhtin, 1981). In this respect, for Rehm too, new 
genres are always the outcome of transformation of earlier genres, similarly to 
Crowston and Williams (2000). In contrast with most analysts of web genres, who 
mainly consider genre evolution on the web as a fast process, Rehm sees the process of 
Chapter 1 - Introduction 
 13
emerging rules and conventions for specific web genres as a “slow-going” progress. 
This view is somehow opposed to Shepherd and Watters’ (2004), for whom the 
identification of web genres is as difficult as hitting a moving target, because of the 
continuous rearrangement of the genre repertoire caused by the functionality afforded 
by the new medium. Similarly, Haas and Grams (2000) see the web as a quickly moving 
target, where analysing format, genres and the design conventions that go into web 
pages is tricky because the technology is constantly upgraded. Dillon and Vaughan 
(1997) suggest relying on the attribute of “shape” of a document to overcome this 
disorientation on the web, while Yates and Sumner (1997) argue that such a rapid 
advance in new technologies results in the evolution of increasingly well-defined genres 
to better support the new communicative needs and practices, thus providing “fixity”, 
i.e. stability, in the production and transmission of texts. 
That the web is a fast-paced medium and that genre repertoire evolves accordingly is 
also proved by the many genre analyses on new kinds of texts, for example the ones 
recently presented at the Workshop on New Text8 on WIKIS (Mehler, 2006; Copestake, 
2006) and BLOGS (Elgersma and de Rijke, 2006). Additionally, I would like to pinpoint 
one effect of the fast evolution: the presence of emerging genres. 
Emerging genres represent a transitional phase in genre evolution. They are genres still 
in formation, without a name, and not fully standardized or acknowledged. They should 
not be confused with novel but already emerged genres, i.e. new genres that are 
acknowledged by an audience and whose genre conventions can be singled out and 
coherently described. By contrast, emerging genres are still in an embryonic phase, 
where it is not yet clear whether they will ever coalesce into a new communication 
object.  
Although evolving in all media and in all historical periods, genres are assumed to be 
slow-forming, often emerging over generations, and proving resistant to change (cf.

Dillon and Gushrowski, 2000). However, the web is recent, fluid and evolving at fast 
pace; consequently the emergence of novel genres is much more rapid on the web than 
in other media, as also observed by Boese (2005: 14), who notes: “new genres are 
emerging frequently and a lot of old ones are in a state of flux”. 
The concept of emerging genres has not been explicitly formulated in the genre 
literature. However, it is useful because it accounts for unclassified or unclassifiable 
web pages. As shown by the findings reported in Crowston and Williams (2000), there 
is a number of web pages that cannot be classified by genre, for different reasons. More 
specifically, they state: “some of these unclassified pages may in fact be emerging 
genres”. It thus appears that one of the reasons that explains the difficulty of classifying 
web pages by genre is the existence of web pages that may belong to emerging genres, 
i.e. to textual patterns without clear or acknowledged genre conventions.  
Crowston and Williams (2000) acutely pointed out that the emergence of a novel genre 
depends on social acceptance. Consequently, it is impossible to predict exactly when an 
emerging genre will become a fully independent genre or even whether it will coalesce 
at all. It is nonetheless important to have a concept that captures the transitional phase 
that currently characterizes so many web pages, i.e. the web pages that remain 
unclassified.  
I suggested considering emerging genres as hypothesised genres. Although we can 
confirm and disconfirm these hypotheses only in the future, some quantitative cues may 
indicate that a new genre is ‘in formation’. Computationally, we might suspect an 
emerging genre when there is a recurrent textual pattern without an acknowledged 
name. Emerging genes do not have a name because a genre name becomes 
acknowledged when the genre itself has an active role and a communicative function in 
a community or society (cf. Swales, 1990: 54-57; Görlach, 2004: 9; Görlach, 2002). For 
example, if we look retrospectively at the formation of a recent web genre – the BLOG – 
it appears that before 1998 BLOGS (or WEB LOGS) were already present on the web, but 
they were still not identified as a genre. They were just ‘web pages’, with similar 
characteristics and functions. In 1999, suddenly a community sprang up using this new 
Chapter 1 - Introduction 
 15
genre (Blood, 2000). Only at this point, the genre label WEB LOG or BLOG started being 
spread and being recognized. 
The advantage of postulating emerging genres is that they help understand the dynamics 
driving genre evolution. If we see the web as a dynamic environment, we can say that 
there are three forces interacting: what we bring from the past (reproduced genres), what 
is new or adapted to the new environment (novel genres and adapted genres), what is 
going to emerge and is not fully formed yet (emerging genres) (Figure 3). 
 
 
 
Figure 3. Genre evolution on the web 
 
This representation of the genre evolution can be applied to virtually any 
communication medium. On the web this process is much more evident because the 
web is fast and we can see many changes taking place in the short term.  
The identification of emerging genres has also some practical benefits. First, it can help 
organize the large number of unclassified or unclassifiable pages populating the web. 
Second, the identification of genres in formation might be especially useful for genre-
based search engines, where the foresight provided by the detection of emerging textual 
patterns can result in a prompt update of genre-based systems, which would then be 
ready to host novel genres as they emerge.  
Ideally, emerging genres should receive no label or multiple labels. No label would 
indicate that the emerging pattern has no clear relation with existing genres, while 
multiple labels would suggest that the new pattern is hybrid and drawing from several 
sources or traditions. 
In this thesis, a set of experiments will show to what extent emerging genres can be 
automatically detected by a standard method, like cluster analysis (Chapter 7). 
Chapter 1 - Introduction

1.3.2 Automatically-Extractable Genre-Revealing Features 
Automatically-extractable genre-revealing features are limited. This limitation strongly 
affects any automatic approach to genre detection. Some researchers only rely on 
surface cues, i.e. very ‘light’ features, such as function words or punctuation marks (see 
Chapter 2), that can be extracted from a text without any pre-processing. For this 
reason, they are considered to be computationally inexpensive. However, genre is a 
complex concept that benefits from more complex features and linguistic insights. In 
this thesis I use an NLP tool, namely a tagger-parser, to extract more sophisticated 
linguistic information and build on it. A series of experiments on features expands the 
range of automatically-extractable genre-revealing features by including POS trigrams 
(Chapter 4) and facets9 (Chapter 5). POS trigrams rely on morphological information 
extracted from a tagger and represent a shallow approach to syntax. Facets rely on the 
output returned by a tagger-parser and build on it. Both can help single-label genre 
classification. Additionally, facets provide a linguistic and textual interpretation that can 
be exploited for a more flexible classification system. 
1.3.3 Automatic Identification of Genre in Web Pages 
As emphasized earlier, although a considerable amount of research has already been 
done in automatic genre classification, most previous work has disregarded the fact that 
many documents, and in particular many web pages, cannot be sorted into a single 
genre. The mainstream tendency has favoured supervised single-label approaches, such 
as logistic or multiple regression (e.g. Kessler et al., 1997; Stamatatos et al., 2001), 
discriminant analysis (e.g. Karlgren and Cutting, 1994; Stamatatos et al., 2000, 2001; 
Meyer zu Eissen and Stein, 2004), and machine learning-based classifiers (e.g. 
Dewdney et al., 2001; Lim et al., 2005b). Another main trend has supported the use of 
surface cues (such as punctuation marks) or shallow linguistic features (such as POS 
tags). In this thesis, a set of experiments shows the advantages and disadvantages of 
                                                 
9 As explained in Chapter 5, the automatically-extractable genre-revealing features that I call ‘facets’ 
differ from the facets used in  facet analysis or facetted classification. 
Chapter 1 - Introduction 
 17
such an approach. The main advantage is that a high level of accuracy on a single-genre 
classification can be reached in a closed and static situation with an ideal combination 
of the following elements: a predictable population, a felicitous genre palette, mixed 
feature sets, a balanced corpus, a state-of-the-art classification algorithm, and 
prototypical web pages (Chapter 10). The main disadvantages are the limitation to a 
single-genre classification and the reduced generality and exportability of these models. 
In brief, this approach seems inappropriate to handle the open web, i.e. a medium still 
fluid and changing at a fast pace, where documents (the web pages) might be complex 
entities. More specifically, the open web accounts for a situation where the population is 
unknown, where web pages might be evolving, hybrid, individualised, or not following 
any genre convention.  
In this thesis I argue that both web page complexity and the fluidity and fast-paced 
evolution of the web need to be captured by a more flexible genre classification scheme, 
i.e. a scheme capable of performing zero-, one- or multi-genre assignment, as 
appropriate.  
An approach that might account for the current situation on the web relies on the idea 
that genres are characterized by recurrent or predominant text types. Such an approach 
is the object of the final experiment of this thesis (Chapter 11).  
Text types are rhetorical/discourse patterns that indicate the purpose of communication. 
When the purpose is to narrate, the NARRATION text type is used; when the purpose is to 
instruct, the INSTRUCTION text type is used; and so on. Normally, a text contains several 
purposes and consequently includes several text types. Genres are intended in this thesis 
as culturally defined and socially acknowledged text categories, like NEWSPAPER 
ARTICLES, RECIPES, or ACADEMIC PAPERS. In other words, genres are cultural objects 
created by a society or a community, characterised by a set of linguistic and non-
linguistic conventions, which can be fulfilled, personalized, transgressed, or colonized, 
but that are nonetheless recognized by the members of the society and community that 
have created them, raising predictable expectations. Text types, on the other hand, are 
more universal, and cut across time, cultures and societies.  
Chapter 1 - Introduction 
 18
Textlinguists point out a relationship between the use and distribution of text types and 
genres (e.g. Werlich, 1976; Adam, 2005). Drawing inspiration from these linguistic 
insights, the basic idea underlying the approach proposed in the final experiment is to 
perform genre analysis within the individual web page by relying on the distribution of 
text types and then combining the predominant text types with other genre-revealing 
features (such as layout tags, functionality tags or genre-specific words) into genres. 
This approach is developed using a corpus-based approach, and exploiting one of the 
new feature sets proposed in this thesis, the facets. Both the assignment of facets to text 
types and the assignment of text types to one or several genres are decided on the basis 
on previous studies, when these are available. All the linguistic insights are combined 
into a simple probabilistic model already used in artificial intelligence for inferential 
reasoning, the odds-likelihood or subjective Bayesian method.  
In this framework, text types should be seen as a kind of ‘processed’ or ‘higher order’ 
feature. As genres cannot be characterized by an unambiguous set of surface cues, text 
types represent a middle layer that gives flexibility to an automatic genre classification 
system, enabling zero-, one- and multi-genre identification. More specifically, a single-
genre assignment can be done when a web page shows a distribution of text types 
and/or other features that can be uniquely ascribed to a single genre. For example, HOW-
TOS can be often unambiguously characterized by an instructional text type laid out as a 
list of steps. A zero-genre assignment is possible when the distribution or combination 
of text types and/or other features is unexpected and cannot be safely ascribed to any 
existing genre. Finally, a multi-genre assignment can be performed when a web page 
shows a distribution or combination of text types and/or other features that is shared by 
several genres. For example, EDITORIALS and SERMONS could be characterized by the 
ARGUMENTATION and EXPOSITION text types with a plain layout. Consequently, a web 
page showing these attributes can be classified as both a SERMON and an EDITORIAL, 
without specifying whether the page is both a SERMON and an EDITORIAL, or a SERMON 
within an EDITORIAL or vice-versa, or half a SERMON and half an EDITORIAL.  
The use of text types has several other advantages. Firstly, text types serve to relate 
genres to one another across different media (printing, the web, email services, etc.). 
Chapter 1 - Introduction 
 19
They also help contextualise emerging genres or difficult web pages. In fact, an analysis 
of genre in terms of text types remains possible even if a novel genre is being 
introduced and its conventions are not yet clear, or if an existing genre is evolving.  
Although the model performing text type and genre identification cannot be fully 
evaluated for zero-genre and multi-genre labelling given the limitations of the current 
state of genre research, it offers an account of genre variation within a web page. The 
original contribution of this model is that it combines several traditions and incorporates 
findings from different fields, namely automatic genre classification, corpus linguistics, 
genre analysis, textlinguistics and artificial intelligence. Its added value consists in a 
more articulated view of genre in web pages instead of a mere single-genre 
classification. 
1.4 Overview of the Thesis 
This thesis is divided into five parts: a preliminary part (Part I), three empirical parts 
(Parts II, III and IV) and an epilogue (Part V). Part I includes this introduction (Chapter 
1) and a literature review (Chapter 2). Part II focuses on automatically-extractable 
genre-revealing features (Chapters 3, 4, 5 and 6). Part III motivates the necessity of a 
flexible genre classification scheme (Chapters 7, 8 and 9). Part IV focuses on methods 
for automatic identification of zero, one, or multiple genres in web pages (Chapters 10 
and 11). Finally, Part V (Chapter 12) reports conclusions and outlines future work.  
Chapter 1 contains this introduction, where claims and motivation are explained. 
Chapter 2 has a wide scope. First, it provides a concise overview of the concept of 
genre. Second, it reviews the main automatic approaches to text type and genre 
identification pointing out why these approaches are inadequate when dealing with 
genres of web pages. Third, it presents some observations about text types. Finally, it 
briefly reviews the different kinds of features that have been used in automatic genre 
classification.  
Chapter 1 - Introduction 
 20
Chapter 3 highlights some open issues about the use of a NLP tool, namely a tagger-
parser, applied to web pages. These issues are not easy to solve. The goal of this chapter 
is to point them out for further discussion, and to highlight that the results of the 
experiments reported in this thesis are conditioned by these issues. 
Chapter 4 presents a first expansion of the range of features useful for automatic genre 
identification: POS trigrams. POS trigrams are assessed on a number of genre categories 
found in the BNC. The idea is that if they prove to be discriminating on a stable corpus 
like the BNC, then they can be applied on a difficult corpus, like a web page collection. 
Chapter 5 presents a second expansion of genre-revealing features: the facets. Facets 
are macro-features, i.e. collections of single features that highlight different aspects, or 
facets, of communication. The idea behind the use of facets instead of single features is 
that the different communication aspects highlighted by the facets can then be 
assembled and composed together to infer text types. Facets can also be used as any 
other feature in any standard method for automatic genre classification. For example, a 
subset of facets, the syntactic patterns, fed into an SVM classifier has an accuracy of 
about 86% vs. an accuracy of about 83% achieved by lexical subordinators. 
Chapter 6 summarizes and discuss the properties of features employed in automatic 
text types and genre identification studies. After having discussed their properties, the 
chapter ends with a list of the actual types of features that will be used in the 
experiments presented in the next parts of the thesis. 
Chapter 7 focuses on the detection of emerging genres. The set of experiments 
presented in this chapter shows to what extent it is possible to detect these forms with a 
standard algorithm, like cluster analysis. Although some emerging textual patterns can 
be identified, cluster analysis has some inherent limitations regarding the stability and 
the interpretation of the clusters. Additionally, the relations of these patterns with 
existing and acknowledged genres remain unspecified. 
Chapter 8 describes a web user study showing that a single genre classification does 
not correspond to web users’ view of web pages. This study reports that 20 out of 25 
Chapter 1 - Introduction 
 21
web pages are labelled using at least three genres. It also shows that when genre 
conventions are unclear, web users tend to disagree more on genre assignment. 
Chapter 9 suggests a characterization of genres of web pages that includes the two 
attributes of genre hybridism and individualisation and explains why they are useful. 
Chapter 10 describes the advantages and disadvantages of the standard single-label 
genre classification of web pages. The main advantage is that a high accuracy (about 
90%) on a single genre can be reached in a closed and static situation with a predictable 
population, a felicitous genre palette, mixed feature sets, a balanced corpus, a state-of-
the-art classification algorithm, and prototypical web pages. The main disadvantage is 
that such a classification model shows a reduced generality and exportability, and 
heavily depends on the above-listed attributes. In brief, it cannot handle the complexity 
of web pages and the fluidity and fast-paced evolution of the web. 
Chapter 11 proposes a new method that implements a zero-to-multi-genre 
classification scheme. In addition to the standard identification of a single genre, this 
model can return multiple genre labels or no genre label. It does this using lingistic 
insights coming from facets and text types. This approach relies on a statistical model 
already used in artificial intelligence, and its results are competitive: about 86% vs. 90% 
for a standard machine-learning model, in ideal conditions; and about 86% vs. 76% in 
more realistic conditions. Although such a model cannot be fully evaluated for zero-
genre and multi-genre labelling given the limitations of the current state of genre 
research, it offers a view on genre variation within a web page. 
Chapter 12 summarizes the main findings and outlines future work.

Chapter 2.  Literature Review 
This chapter has a wide scope. First, it provides an overview of the concept of genre and 
its use in the literature of automatic genre classification. Second, it reviews the main 
methodologies employed in automatic genre classification studies pointing out why they 
appear inadequate for a flexible approach to genre. Third, it presents studies that suggest 
a relation between genre and text types. Finally, it reviews the different kinds of features 
that have been used in automatic genre classification.  
2.1 The Elusiveness of the Concept of Genre 
The term ‘genre’ has a long-standing tradition in many academic disciplines, such as 
literary studies, linguistics and rhetoric. It is also increasingly used for non-literary and 
non-written texts, such as cinema, music, design and media studies. This thesis only 
deals with genres of written electronic documents. 
It has often been pointed out (e.g. Karlgren, 2004) that, although well-established, the 
term ‘genre’ remains elusive when one tries to pin it down and define it. Apparently, we 
all intuitively understand what genre is when we deal with texts: genre is one of the 
possible classifications that can be applied to documents. Thanks to the concept of 
genre, we can distinguish between ACADEMIC PAPERS, FABLES, EDITORIALS, SONNETS, 
NOVELS, INTERVIEWS, LETTERS, RECIPES, PATIENT LEAFLETS, REVIEWS and so forth.  
However, genre is much more than a typology of documents. From Aristotle’s Poetics 
onwards, genre definitions abound. Recently, genre has been defined as: 
• a codification of discursive properties (Todorov, 1990/1978);  
• a social action (Miller, 1984);  
• a persuasive classifying statement (Rosmarin, 1985); 
• a pattern or recurring type of text (Agre, 1998; Erickson, 1997, 1999, 2000); 
• an interface metaphor (Toms and Campbell, 1999); 
• a typified communicative action (Yates and Orlikoswki, 1992). 
Chapter 2 – Literature Review 
 23
Also, genre plays a central role in linguistic schools, such as the Sidney School, centred 
upon the Systemic Functional Linguistics (e.g. Halliday and Kirkwood, 1973, 1978; 
Martin, 1992; Eggins and Martin, 1997; Ventola, 2005), and the North American 
School10 (e.g. Bazerman, 1988, 1994; Swales, 1990, Bathia, 1993; Berkenkotter and 
Huckin, 1995; Yates and Orlikowski, 1992; Orlikowski and Yates, 1994a, 1994b, 
1998). A comprehensive overview on genre theories looks like a titanic endeavour. One 
problem is that there is no consensus of what genre is, and scholars admit that genre 
cannot be analysed from a unified view (e.g. cf. Crowston and Williams, 2000; Kwasnik 
and Crowston, 2005; Rosso, 2005). 
Interestingly, this diversity does not seem to affect the restricted field of automatic 
genre identification studies. In this field, researchers define genre in relation to topic 
(e.g. Karlgren and Cutting, 1994), or do not provide any definition (e.g. Stamatatos et 
al. 2000; Rauber and Müller-Kögler, 2001). Others borrow definitions from genre 
analysts (e.g. Wolters and Kirsten, 1999 refer to Swales, 1990; Shepherd et al., 2004 
cite Rosmarin, 1985). In other words, in automatic genre classification studies, the focus 
is not on the definition of what genre is, but on the potential usefulness of the concept of 
genre as a classifying taxonomy. This stance is well summarized by Kessler et al. 
(1997) for whom a genre is simply a: 
“widely recognized class of texts defined by some communicative purpose or other 
functional traits, provided that the function is connected to some formal cues or 
commonalities and that the class is extensible.” (Kessler et al., 1997)  
Additionally, the composition or the essence of genre taxonomy is not discussed either. 
The basic assumption is that people roughly know what genre is and researchers either 
use genre categories available in electronic corpora like the Brown corpus (Kucera and 
Francis, 1967), or call ‘genre’ any non-topical category that could be combined with 
topic to reduce information overload in web searches (e.g. Lee and Myaeng, 2004 or 
Lim et al., 2005b). For this reason, not only textual categories such as NEWSPAPER 
ARTICLE, ACADEMIC PAPER, REPORT, etc. have been considered genres, but also 
                                                 
10 Also called Situated Genre Theory or New Rhetoric. 
Chapter 2 – Literature Review 
 24
polarities, such as subjective-objective and positive-negative (Finn and Kushmerick, 
2003, 2006), or style (Karlgren, 2000). 
This simplified approach to genre for practical purposes is however challenged by a 
recent line of research in information studies. This area of research provides important 
insights into the application of genre for classification and information retrieval in 
digital libraries or the web. Researchers in this area suggest several solutions. For 
example, Tyrväinen and Päivärinta (1999), Kwnasnik et al. (2001), or Crowston and 
Kwasnik (2004), propose the use of facet analysis or facetted classification – a type of 
multi-dimensional classification11 – to account for the complexity of the concept of 
genre; Haas and Grams (1998, 2000) investigate the ideal requirements for web page 
classification; and Rosso (2005) explores to what extent the concept of genre could 
effectively improve the search of web users. Although this line of research is geared 
towards a practical implementation, no computational or statistical models have been 
implemented so far, apart from the proposal of a computational approach described in 
Roussinov et al. (2001). The statistical multi-facetted classification implemented by 
Kessler et al. (1997) (see later) is totally independent from this area.  
Another line of research focuses more on genre evolution on the web. As mentioned in 
Chapter 1, Shepherd and Watters (1998, 1989) coined a special name – cybergenre – to 
designate genres on the web, i.e. those genres triggered by “the combination of the 
computer and the Internet”. It is worth repeating that cybergenre – or web genre – (the 
authors use these two terms as synonyms, cf. Shepherd and Watters, 2004) are 
characterized by the triple <content, form, functionality>, where the first two elements 
are common to traditional genres, while functionality refers exclusively to the 
capabilities offered by the web. Web genres represent a new lineage in the genre family, 
a lineage where the members have a distinct attribute, the functionality attribute. As 
                                                 
11 “Facetted classification has its roots in the works of S.R. Ranganathan, an Indian scholar, who posited 
that any complex entity could be viewed from a number of perspectives or facets. He suggested the 
fundamental categories of Personality, Matter, Energy, Space and Time. Over the years, Ranganathan’s 
facets have been reinterpreted in many contexts; they have been used to classify objects as disparate as 
computer software (for reuse), patents, books, and art objects” (Crowston and Kwasnik, 2004). 
Chapter 2 – Literature Review 
 25
already noted, Shepherd and Watters (1998, 1989) illuminatingly emphasize that 
functionality has caused a leap in genre evolution, creating a new species, the web 
genre. However, they assume that a web page instantiates only a single web genre. At 
least, this is what appears from their practical experiments (Shepherd et al., 2004 and 
Kennedy and Shepherd, 2005). 
Generally speaking, it is evident that there is a wide gap between the sophisticated and 
diverse theoretical approaches to genre proposed by genre analysts and theorists, and 
the simple and theoretically unsophisticated, hands-on approach to genre in automatic 
genre identification studies. To sum up, in automatic genre classification studies:  
• genre is a classifying principle;  
• genres are textual categories.  
 
As the term genre remains vague, in the next section I draw some boundaries between 
genre and other textual classes, such as register, style, and domain. 
2.1.1 Genre and Neighbouring Terms 
There are several ways of classifying a text, because texts vary along several 
dimensions. The term ‘genre’ in automatic approaches is sometimes used 
interchangeably with terms like ‘text types’, ‘register’, or ‘style’ which, in principle, are 
supposed to refer to different textual dimensions. For example, Karlgren (2000) 
employs “genre”, “text types” and “functional style”, and also uses expressions such as 
“stylistic experiments”, “stylistic analysis”, and “stylistics”. The synonymous use of 
these terms can also be found in Stamatatos et al. (2001) (“text genre detection concerns 
the identification of the kind (or functional style) of the text”). Dewdney et al. (2001) 
use the wording “format style, i.e. ‘genre’ ”; Johannesson and Wallström (1999) prefer 
“stylistic genres”; for Klavans and Kan (1998) “text types” and “genres” are synonyms. 
A sensible distinction between the terms ‘genre’, ‘register’, ‘text types’, ‘style’, and 
‘domain’ is suggested by Lee (2001). According to Lee (2001):  
• Genre relates to membership of texts in culturally recognizable categories (e.g. NEWSPAPER 
ARTICLE or ACADEMIC PAPER). 
Chapter 2 – Literature Review 
 26
• Register focuses on linguistic patterns associated with different situations (e.g. legal register 
or formal register). 
• Text types refer to four traditional rhetorical categories of NARRATION, ARGUMENTATION, 
EXPOSITION and ARGUMENTION. 
Let me briefly stop to discuss the last point. Although Lee argues that the term ‘text 
types’ should be used only to refer these rhetorical partitions, and not to Biber’s (1988, 
1989, 1993) empirically derived textual dimensions12, these are indeed known as text 
types. It is worth adding that this term is also employed by some scholars (e.g. for 
instance Görlach13) to refer mainly to instrumental or practical genres; finally, other 
scholars, as noted also by Lee, use ‘text types’ and ‘genres’ interchangeably, as 
synonyms (e.g. Stubbs, 1998).  
In this thesis, the term ‘text types’ refers both to traditional rhetorical categories and to 
the empirically-derived Biberian text types. To resume Lee’s (2001) list: 
• domain is centred on subject fields (e.g. religion or hobbies); 
• individual style has its essence in creativity and idiosyncrasy and focuses on single authors 
(e.g. Jane Austen’s style or Ian MacEwan’s style).  
 
Additional distinctions are possible. Together with personal style, I would also list 
‘functional styles’, that include either the five categories suggested by the School of 
Prague (namely, public affairs style, everyday communication style, scientific style, 
journalistic style, literary style) or stylistic variation characterising textual varieties, 
such as daily newspapers vs. weekly magazines (cf. Vachek, 1975).  
As Lee (2001) points out, it is important to realize that much of the confusion with all 
these terms depends on the ambiguity of language itself. Often, the same word refers to 
different textual dimensions, as in the case of the label ‘conversation’, which can 
indicate a register (one can talk in a conversational register during an INTERVIEW), a 
style (an author can employ a conversational style) or a genre label (CONVERSATION is 
also a genre category of spoken texts) (Lee, 2001: 47).  
Another useful distinction that is worth stressing relates to folksonomy classification, 
text categorization and web page categorization.  
                                                 
12 Lee (1999) has vigorously contested the validity of Biber’s statistical approach to the detection of 
empirically-driven text types. 
13 See Görlach, (2004: 102). The difference between Görlach’s text types and Biber’s text types is  also 
explained in Diller (2001) and Görlach (2002: 17, footnote 2). 
Chapter 2 – Literature Review 
 27
Folksonomies are user-generated categories employed to classify the content (and not 
the genre) of web pages. The use of folksonomies has recently been proposed to solve 
the problem of metadata for the Semantic Web (see Wikipedia’s entry for 
‘folksonomy’).  
Text categorization and web page categorization refer to a classification based on the 
content or topic of a text. There is a large amount of research in text categorization, as 
indicated by the extensive bibliography14 on this subject updated and maintained by 
Evgeniy Gabrilovich and originally created by Fabrizio Sebastiani. 
Although topic and genre are usually considered orthogonal in automatic classification, 
a few attempts have been made to use the concept of genre to help topical classification 
(e.g. Lee and Myaeng, 2002, 2004); however the interpretation of the results remains 
inconclusive. It seems that the variation of genre and topic occurs along different 
dimensions. As Karlgren and Cutting (1994) acutely point out:  
“Texts about certain topics may only occur in certain genres, and texts in certain genres 
may only treat certain topic; most of the topics do, however, occur in several genres [my 
emphasis]”. (Karlgren and Cutting (1994) 
Drawing from this observation, in this thesis I assume that genre and topic are 
independent and do not influence each other. 
Although the concept of genre can be differentiated from neighbouring concepts, genre 
classes remain heterogeneous. Additionally, they are not mutually exclusive. This fact 
has been overlooked by mainstream automatic genre classification research, whose 
main assumption can be expressed by the equation: one document = one genre. 
In the next section I will summarize the main approaches to automatic genre 
classification, highlighting to what extent previous methods go beyond discrete single-
genre classification.

2.2 Approaches to Automatic Genre Classification 
Broadly speaking, authors working in automatic genre classification assume that genres 
are mutually exclusive discrete classes, each document instantiating a single genre. For 
this reason, the mainstream approach is based on discrete single-genre classification. 
However, documents do not always belong only to one genre. As explained in 
Chapter 1, web pages cannot always fit into a single genre. Although the inadequacy of 
the equation one web page = one genre has been acknowledged by authors 
working in automatic web genre identification (e.g. Lim et al., 2005b explicitly state: “a 
classifier should be able to assign multiple genres into a document as the case may be”), 
still most methodologies rely on the assignment of a single genre label to the individual 
web page. This approach is taken for the sake of practicality, but it is inadequate when 
dealing with complex documents like web pages.  
Single-label classification means that only one category can be assigned to each 
document15. Discrete classification implies a binary decision: either the document 
belongs or does not belong to a specific class16. Single-genre assignment is usually 
implemented using supervised algorithms. These are statistical models that ‘learn’ from 
documents that are pre-labelled by genre. This means that the learning of the algorithm 
is ‘supervised’ and guided by the set of examples provided as the training set. The 
annotation of the documents by genre either come from public resources, for instance 
electronic corpora like the Brown corpus, or is performed by human annotators. The 
extent of the generality of the learning is assessed by predicting genre categories of 
unlabelled documents, the test set17. The correctness of predictions is then evaluated 
against the correct genre classes of the test set, also provided to the algorithm. Several 
standard evaluation measures exist, for example, accuracy, precision, recall or 
f-measures (Manning and Schütze, 1999: 268-269). These evaluation measures 
                                                 
15 See Sebastiani (2002) for a distinction between single-label and multi-label classification. 
16 See Sebastiani (2002) for a distinction between hard/discrete and soft classification. 
17 As an alternative to the test set, other validation techniques exist, like cross-validation or leave-one-out 
(cf. Witten and Frank, 2005: 144-153). 
Chapter 2 – Literature Review

presuppose that each document belongs to only a single class, although some 
adaptations have been made (cf. Schapire and Singer, 1999, 2000; Brinker et al., 2006).  
The supervised approach has been applied to genres represented in public electronic 
corpora (e.g. Karlgren and Cutting, 1994 and Kessler et al., 1997 worked on the Brown 
corpus; Stamatatos et al., 2000 on the Wall Street Journal Collection; Dewdney et al., 
2001 on the Carnegie Mellon University corpus), and on genres of ad-hoc built web 
page collections (e.g. Shepherd et al., 2004; Kennedy and Shepherd, 2005; Lee and 
Myaeng, 2002, 2004; Meyer zu Eissen and Stein, 2004; Boese, 2005; Lim et al., 2005).  
Common single-label discrete supervised algorithms used in automatic genre 
classification studies are discriminant analysis (e.g. Karlgren and Cutting,1994; Meyer 
zu Eissen and Stein, 2004) logistic and multiple regression (Kessler et al., 1997; 
Stamatatos et al., 2001), and/or machine-learning-based classifiers, such as C4.5 (Finn 
and Kusmerick, 2003, 2006), Naive Bayes classifiers (Dewdney et al., 2001), neural 
networks (Shepherd et al., 2004; Kennedy and Shepherd, 2005), or Support Vector 
Machines (SVM)(Meyer zu Eissen and Stein, 2004).  
The supervised approach is corpus-based. As mentioned earlier, the supervised 
algorithm learns from the documents included in the training set. Each document has a 
vector form and represents a single genre. Usually, a genre corpus includes several 
genres. The genres included in a corpus constitute a genre palette (see footnote 5 in 
Chapter 1). Two issues related to the corpus-based approach have not been investigated 
or addressed so far: (a) the influence of the genre palette and corpus size on the 
performance; (b) the absence of a genre benchmark. 
These two issues are interrelated. Although many experiments have been performed and 
many different algorithms have been tried out by different authors, any comparison 
among them is virtually impossible, as each author has used a different genre palette 
and different corpus size. Some comparisons are possible because some authors present 
sets of experiments using the same corpus but different algorithms (e.g. Dewdney et al., 
2001), but basically each experiment or set of experiments remain self-contained and it 
is impossible to say to what extent findings can be generalized. Also, any external 
Chapter 2 – Literature Review 
 30
validation of the results remains infeasible because of the lack of an agreed benchmark. 
However, this last inconvenience can be partially overcome by sharing corpora. For 
example, all the corpora used in the experiments described in this thesis are available 
online at <http://www.nltg.brighton.ac.uk/home/Marina.Santini/>. Similarly, E. Boese 
has created a web page, <http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~boese/Research/Corpora.html>, 
containing links to publicly available corpora. 
 This thesis does not address these two issues, which require extensive discussion and 
experimentation. Admittedly, the experiments presented in the following chapters suffer 
from the same limitation as previous experiments in this respect.  
What this thesis focuses on is another issue that has not been satisfactorily explored in 
previous research, i.e. the implementation of a flexible genre identification system. It is 
important to stress, however, that not all experiments rely on discrete single-genre 
classification. As a matter of fact, two studies describe more flexible systems, namely 
Kessler et al. (1997) and Rauber and Müller-Kögler (2001), which I will discuss next. 
Kessler et al. (1997) explicitly address the problem of genre heterogeneity by proposing 
the multi-facetted approach. This implementation is independent from the line of 
research in information studies mentioned in Section 2.1. Kessler et al. (1997) present 
one of the most articulated approaches to genre classification proposed so far. This 
study has a special position in the literature and is widely cited. However, it has never 
been replicated. 
In the framework proposed by Kessler et al. (1997), genres are expressed in terms of 
bundles of generic facets that correlate to surface cues. A facet is:  
“a property which distinguishes a class of texts that answers to certain practical interests, 
and which is associated with a characteristic set of computable structural or linguistic 
properties, the 'generic cues'”. (Kessler et al., 1997) 
In principle, a given text can be described in terms of a large number of facets. 
However, in their experiments, the authors use only three categorical facets: brow, 
narrative, and genre. Brow characterizes a text with respect to the intellectual 
background required to understand the text itself. A brow facet has several degrees; it 
Chapter 2 – Literature Review 
 31
can be popular, middle, upper-middle and high. Narrative is a binary facet and decides 
whether a text is written in a narrative style. Genre classifies a text either as REPORTAGE, 
EDITORIAL, SCITECH, LEGAL, NON-FICTION, or FICTION. A set of 55 lexical, character-
level and derivative cues were used to describe the 499 documents of the Brown corpus, 
which were manually re-annotated according to these three-facet classification scheme. 
The classification algorithms used in the study are logistic regression and neural 
networks. Their results show that categorization decisions can be made with reasonable 
accuracy.  
Although undoubtedly original and innovative, the facetted approach implemented by 
Kessler et al. (1997) raises a number of questions. A first question concerns the 
classification technique. The authors state “genres are considered to be generally 
reducible to bundles of facets”. However, in the implementation genre is ONE of the 
three categorical facets. Moreover, the classification by genre proper appears as atomic 
as any other single-genre classification experiment, since the classification algorithms 
assign only one genre per document. This means that this approach does not allow 
multi-genre classification. In other words, the multi-facetted approach implemented by 
Kessler et al. (1997) classifies different aspects in a document, not different genres. The 
three facets, brow, narrative, and genre return three independent and uncorrelated 
classifications of which genre is one.  
The second question is about the amount of manual annotation required to train a multi-
facetted system. For their experiment, Kessler and co-workers re-annotated from scratch 
the Brown corpus using their own classification scheme, apparently ignoring any issue 
connected to inter-rater agreement. 
Finally, it is hard to see in what way this framework is capable of accommodating new 
genres – one of the declared advantages of the approach – “as yet unseen bundles of 
facets”.  
In sum, Kessler et al. (1997) have the merit of having faced genre classification in an 
original way, which would be worth exploring and discussing more in depth in the 
future. 
Chapter 2 – Literature Review 
 32
Using a completely different approach, Rauber and Müller-Kögler (2001) achieve a 
representation of genre mixture, rather than a multi-genre assignment. Rauber and 
Müller-Kögler (2001) rely on a clustering algorithm. The basic difference between 
clustering and classification is that clustering is an unsupervised method, while 
classification is supervised. This means that with clustering techniques, documents are 
not pre-labelled by genre, as is the case in supervised classification. 
In their study, genres are integrated with topic for classification of a digital library. 
Documents are clustered with the self-organizing map (SOM), an unsupervised neural 
network. Genres and content are mapped onto a colour space. In this colour space, 
mixed or fuzzy genres are automatically assigned to intermediate colours.  
Rauber and Müller-Kögler’s (2001) experiment is interesting and definitely worth 
researching further. However, the impression is that in this experiment, the assignment 
of documents to mixed or fuzzy genres is more incidental than deliberate. Also, the 
colour metaphor appears unintuitive, despite the evaluation (based on human subjects) 
showing that most people had a “feeling of what to expect from a document in a specific 
colour after visiting a few documents on their respective areas of interest”.  
In conclusion, none of the previous studies addresses satisfactorily the problem of a 
flexible genre classification scheme, i.e. a scheme that may encompass zero-, one- or 
multi-genre assignment, as required by the actual state of genres on the web, discussed 
in Chapter 1. 
One interesting suggestion that could increase the flexibility of an automatic genre 
classification system comes from textlinguistics and leverages on the use of text types 
for analysing genres, as explained in the following section. 
2.3 Text Type Analysis and Automatic Identification 
As mentioned in Chapter 1 and earlier in this chapter, text types are rhetorical/discourse 
patterns that indicate the purpose of communication. When the purpose is to narrate, the 
NARRATION text type is used; when the purpose is to instruct, the INSTRUCTION text type is 
Chapter 2 – Literature Review 
 33
used; and so on. Normally, a text contains several purposes and consequently includes 
several text types. For instance, a single text can be written to instruct, explain, describe, 
narrate, persuade, and support an argument. These purposes or functions are consciously 
or unconsciously enacted by text producers, and identified by text receivers. The 
identification of text types is deeply rooted in our culture (Faigley and Meyer, 1983), 
and it is considered to be a basic skill, crucial in all activities involving text production 
and comprehension. It is so much so that the BBC has set up a website (the BBC 
Skillswise) where web users can learn how to identify different types of text 
(DESCRIPTIVE, INFORMATIVE, PERSUASIVE, and INSTRUCTIVE)18. This is not an isolated 
case, for example the UK Adult Literacy website also focuses on the importance of 
identifying the purpose of a text19. Furthermore, many universities have online writing 
labs where students are taught how to deal with different types of texts, from 
ARGUMENTATION to DEFINITION, DESCRIPTION and so forth20. 
Several text typologies have been proposed so far. For example, Werlich (1976) 
analyses five text types, namely DESCRIPTION, NARRATION, EXPOSITION, ARGUMENTATION 
and INSTRUCTION; Adam (2005), five text types, i.e. DESCRIPTIVE, NARRATIVE, 
ARGUMENTATIVE, EXPLICATIVE, and DIALOGICAL; Beaugrande and Dressler (1981: 185) 
add literary texts, poetic texts, scientific texts, didactic texts to the traditional text types 
DESCRIPTIVE, NARRATIVE, and ARGUMENTATIVE; Longacre (1976, 1983) identifies four 
general types which he calls “deep structure genres”, i.e. NARRATIVE, EXPOSITORY, 
PROCEDURAL and HORTATORY; and so on (a useful discussion of different text typologies 
can be found in Fludernik, 2000). In addition to theoretical text typologies, there is also 
the empirically derived typology for English proposed by Biber (1989), i.e. INTIMATE 
INTERPERSONAL INTERACTION, INFORMATIONAL INTERACTION, SCIENTIFIC EXPOSITION,

LEARNED EXPOSITION, IMAGINATIVE NARRATIVE, GENERAL NARRATIVE EXPOSITION, SITUATED 
REPORTAGE and INVOLVED PERSUASION. 
A potentially fruitful relation between genres and text types is suggested by scholars 
belonging to textlinguistics (e.g. Werlich, 1976; Adam, 2005), a discipline of theoretical 
linguistics. This relation is underpinned by qualitative genre-specific analysis, such as 
the recent analysis of the HOME PAGE interpreted in terms of Adam’s text typology by 
Askehave and Nielsen (2004).  
In particular, the German textlinguist Egon Werlich observes that genres are 
characterized by recurrent or predominant text types (Werlich, 1976: 46). Additionally, 
he lists and describes the specific features (morphological, syntactic and discourse 
features) correlated to each of the text types in his typology, and indicates possible 
distributions of text types within genres. However, his approach is more theoretical than 
empirical, and only a few examples are provided. 
Independently from Werlich, a decade later an American corpus-linguist, Douglas 
Biber, proposed a quantitative corpus-based approach to text types. Biber’s text types, 
like Werlich’s, are characterized by a set of co-occurring features. However, unlike 
Werlich, Biber determines the co-occurrence of features in text types using factor 
analysis21 rather than qualitative and manual linguistic analysis. Not geared towards 
genre classification, Biber’s methodology focuses on text type detection in order to 
provide insights into cross-genre variation (Biber, 1988, 1989, 1993). More precisely: 
“The similarities and differences among genres are considered with respect to each of these 
dimensions [i.e. the text types], and the overall relations among genres in speech and 
writing are specified by consideration of all dimensions simultaneously. Genres can be 
similar with respect to some dimensions but quite different with respect to others; the 
textual relations among genres are determined by the joint assessment of similarities and 
differences with respect to all dimensions.” (Biber, 1988: 121) 
                                                 
21 Accurately speaking, Biber carries out the ‘multi-dimensional analysis’, i.e. a corpus-based technique 
based on the combination of factor analysis, cluster analysis and other statistical tests (fully described in 
Biber, 1988, 1989 and summarized in Biber, 2004a).  
Chapter 2 – Literature Review 
 35
Biber applies the same approach to analyse variation across other textual classes, like 
registers as in Biber (1995), or Google topical categories as in Biber (2004b). 
As both Werlich and Biber provide extensive insight into genre variation in terms of 
text types, a possible approach to a more flexible automatic genre identification system 
would be to exploit Werlich’s idea on predominant text types relying on the use of 
corpora, and integrating in it findings and observations from Biber’s experience. As text 
types are defined by linguistic features, one potential problem for the accomplishment 
of this solution is represented by the paucity of automatically-extractable linguistic 
features, as discussed in the next section. 
2.4 Limitation of Automatically-Extractable Features 
In the mid-80s Biber made a huge effort to collect 67 linguistically motivated features, 
mainly from socio-linguistic studies and from the comprehensive grammar by Quirk et 
al. (1985). A thick Appendix in his Variation across speech and writing (Biber, 1988: 
221-245) is dedicated to the description of these features, which were used to detect text 
types across genres with the multi-dimensional approach (see footnote 21). The notion 
of function is fundamental for Biber’s features, because: 
“The notion of function is closely associated with the notion of situation. A primary 
motivation for analysis of the components of situation is the desire to link the functions of 
particular linguistic features to variation in the communicative situation.” (Biber, 1988: 33) 
Biber’s (1988) features link linguistic traits to variations in the communicative situation, 
so that it is possible to derive the external context in which the text has been produced 
from the language employed in the text. In contrast, most of the feature sets used in 
automatic genre classification studies lack such a strong linguistic and situational 
motivation. Additionally, although most of Biber’s features were automatically 
extracted, some required manual intervention, because NLP tools were not so developed 
in the 80’s. Understandably, authors of automatic genre classification studies oppose 
any manual intervention. For this reason, Karlgren and Cutting (1994), pioneers in 
automatic genre classification, show a simple method for categorizing texts into the pre-
determined text genre categories in the Brown corpus using only 20 features – a subset 
Chapter 2 – Literature Review 
 36
of Biber’s feature set – which are “easy to compute assuming we have a part of speech 
tagger”.  
However, even a tagger, or morphological analyser, is considered cumbersome when 
imagining a scenario where automatic genre classification should be part of an 
information retrieval system, as argued by Kessler et al. (1997) or Stamatatos et al. 
(2000). The assumption is that it is preferable to achieve genre classification with 
computationally inexpensive features. For this reason, easily extractable features, such 
as function words22 or punctuation marks (used by Stamatatos et al., 2000), or surface 
cues, such as lexical, character-level and derivative cues (used by Kessler et al., 1997) 
are considered ideal. Yet most authors realise that morphological information is 
important for genre classification, as shown by the comparative set of experiments 
carried out by Dewdney et al. (2001), where their “presentational’ features”23 
outperform the content words24 of a bag-of-words (BOW) approach25. This applies also 
to web documents. Researchers working with web pages (like Mayer zu Eissen and 
Stein, 2004 or Lim et al., 2005a, 2005b) include POS tags in their feature sets. 
Some other authors have tried to apply features used in topical text categorization – i.e. 
the content words used in the BOW approach – to genre classification. This approach 
has not proved satisfactory. Findings have shown that a classification by genre using 
content words has the major drawback of not being genre-revealing (Muresan et al., 
2006) or not being exportable (Boese and Howe, 2005b). Further discussion on the 
limitation of content words as a genre-revealing feature is contained in Chapter 6. 
An original kind of feature is proposed by Rehm (2002, 2005, 2006) who suggests the 
use of an HTML parser to extract features that uniquely characterise the ACADEMIC’S 
                                                 
22 Functional words or function words are words that have little lexical meaning, but serve to express 
grammatical relationships with other words, such as articles, prepositions, or pronouns. 
23 Presentational features range from linguistic features, like frequency of adjectives, past tense verbs, 
sentence complexity, etc., to layout features, such as line spacing, tabulation, mark-up tags, etc. 
24 Content words, or terms, are semantically rich words, i.e. words bearing lexical meaning. 
25 Broadly speaking, the BOW approach includes the content words contained in documents. 
Chapter 2 – Literature Review 
 37
PERSONAL HOME PAGE web genre. As noted in Chapter 1, Rehm proposes that web 
genres should be identified at website level, and not at web page level. This means that 
a web genre can be instantiated in a website made of a single web page (“a minimal web 
genre”) or of several web pages. His HTML parser – designed for the ACADEMIC’S 
PERSONAL HOME PAGE web genre – analyses the web pages of a website by means of 
several processing stages and inserts the results directly into the DOM tree in the form 
of XML elements and attributes, so that both the original HTML structure and the 
determined macrostructure are available at the same time for secondary processing 
steps. The model consists of three levels of granularity that represent the constituents of 
the web genre: compulsory web genre modules (the fundamental building blocks), node 
types and optional hypertext types. 
However, the HTML structure extracted from the parser simply represents a kind of 
structural features that will be fed into traditional classifiers: 
“Our current design for the architecture of this search engine is built on three main 
components: (a) The text parser is needed to extract as much explicitly- and implicitly-
contained structure in a source document as possible. This data, along with certain 
keywords will comprise the majority of information which is required for, (b) the web 
genre classifier, which, in our opinion, can be based on one (or more) of the classic 
machine learning algorithms or approches (kNN, Naive Bayes, C4.5 etc). The third 
component is (c) a set of ontologies/taxonomies represented in OWL [...].” (Rehm, 2005) 
Although classification results are not yet published in English, it seems that this 
valuable architecture could be very profitable for information extraction (one of the 
declared aims of Rehm’s project) or summarization, where the regularity of a single 
genre as instantiated in a single domain allows the automatic identification of the 
relevant parts of the content to be extracted or summarized. Similarly, Mehler and 
Gleim (2006) aim at “representing hypertextual units with a focus on websites as 
instances of webgenres” for mining their hidden structure. However, for genre 
classification proper, this approach seems to entail too much overhead, as we can see in 
following passage: 
“Analysing samples of HTML documents with regard to their Web genres usually involves 
one of two goals. First, randomly collected instances on one Web genre can be examined in 
order to construct empirically a Web genre profile for this very Web genre. Second, if a 
sample contains randomly collected documents of arbitrary Web genres (i.e. arbitrary 
documents), the aim is to identify all Web genres, node types and possibly Web genre 
Chapter 2 – Literature Review 
 38
modules contained in the sample, in order to get an idea of the variety of Web genres in use 
within a particular domain or discourse community.” (Rehm, 2006) 
Moving back to linguistic features, the use of syntactic features appears peripheral in 
genre classification studies. Encouragingly, an isolated experiment by Stamatatos et al. 
(2001) has shown that syntactic features can have a positive impact on genre 
discrimination. In summary,  
• The main trend in automatic genre classification research has supported either the use of 
surface cues extracted without any pre-processing, or shallow linguistic features, like POS 
tags. 
• The HTML structure of web genres could be exploited, but the overhead of such an 
approach for automatic genre classification seems to outweigh the potential benefits. 
• The potential discriminative power of syntactic features is under-explored. 
 
As syntactic features appear promising, it would be worth investigating them further by 
exploiting the linguistic information provided by NLP tools (like taggers and parsers) 
and building on them in order to obtain a richer linguistic and textual representation, 
potentially useful for a more flexible automatic genre identification. 
2.5 Conclusion 
In this chapter I emphasized four main points that emerge from the literature on genre. 
The first point refers to the difficulty of pinning down the concept of genre from a 
unified perspective. Also defining the boundaries between ‘genre’ and neighbouring 
terms, like ‘text types’ or ‘style’ can be difficult because of some conceptual overlap or 
vagueness. In a few words, the concept of genre is recognized and used, but not 
unanimously described or defined. 
By contrast, the second point highlights the unanimity of the views on genres in 
automatic genre classification studies. When moving to this restricted field, the plethora 
of definitions disappears: genre simply becomes a classification principle, and genre 
classes are textual classes treated as discrete and mutually exclusive categories.  
Although genre classification must necessarily assume that the concept of genre can be 
used as a classification principle, the treatment of genre classes as mutually exclusive 
categories is less justifiable, especially when dealing with web pages and with the 
Chapter 2 – Literature Review 
 39
current state of evolution of the web. For this reason, I stressed the necessity of looking 
at different solutions. The third point concerns the quest of a different approach to 
automatic genre classification. I suggested that a viable solution could be represented by 
the analysis of genres in terms of text types as suggested by some linguists. In this 
respect, Werlich’s observation about the predominance of text types in genres could be 
tested in an experimental setting, and integrated with Biber’s findings. This approach 
requires more linguistically sophisticated features, i.e. features that can be functionally 
interpreted. 
However, the fourth point highlights that the range of automatically-extractable features 
is quite restricted. A possible starting point would be to investigate the potential of more 
complex linguistic features, like syntactic features, and see if they underpin an 
automatic approach to genre analysis in terms of text types. 
The expansion and enhancement of the range of automatically-extractable features is the 
aim of the chapters included in the next part (Part II) of this thesis.

This chapter opens Part II of this thesis, which is mostly dedicated to the expansion of 
the range of automatically-extractable features. While the other chapters included in this 
part (Chapters 4, 5 and 6) contain the description of the different types of features that 
can be used for automatic genre identification, this chapter merely highlights some open 
issues about the use of NLP tools applied to web pages. Although these issues are not 
easy to solve, they do not invalidate the use of NLP tools, but serve to warn against 
inaccuracy that may influence the results of the experiments reported in this thesis.  
3.1 Introduction 
The main goal of this chapter is to highlight some open issues related to the application 
of NLP tools to web pages. As one of the claims of this thesis is that automatic genre 
identification in web pages may benefit from complex linguistic features extracted using 
NLP tools, it is important to highlight possible problems arising from the application of 
these tools to web documents. These problems do not invalidate the use of NLP tools on 
web documents. Conversely, they stimulate further refinement of these valuable 
resources. My only suggestion is to apply some caution when assessing results from any 
automatic approach to web pages 
Broadly speaking, NLP tools are applications that extract and/or process linguistic 
knowledge from texts. The linguistic knowledge returned by NLP tools takes the form 
of linguistic features. Several types of NLP tools are available26. In this thesis, I only

focus on the application of two commonly used automatic NLP tools, the tagger, a.k.a. 
morphological analyser, and the parser, a.k.a. syntactic analyser.  
In Chapter 1, I pointed out that web pages are complex and composite documents, 
where not all elements belong together, but all of them contribute to form a whole. 
However, textual complexity is not the only disturbing factor of this kind of document. 
Web pages are also noisy. For this reason, web page classification is notoriously much 
more difficult than “pure-text classification due to the large variety of noisy information 
embedded in Web pages” (Shen et al., 2004).  
Noise in web pages takes various forms. If we take a raw web page, i.e. a web page 
downloaded from the web without any pre-processing, many idiosyncrasies can be 
found in it, especially if the page has an HTML format. Typos, grammar mistakes, 
exotic names, and extra-linguistic elements, such as HTML tags and code snippets, can 
hamper the application of NLP tools. It is indeed difficult to regularize HTML mark-up 
as a pre-processing step because HTML syntax is permissive and unpredictable, and 
HTML is written by humans using different coding styles. Even when HTML code is 
written with software packages, such as Microsoft Frontpage, Micromedia 
Dreamweaver, or Microsoft Word, these programs might use dissimilar coding 
conventions. As a matter of fact, such pages are often the worst, because they contain 
many extraneous markups. Cleaning or standardizing utilities, such as the freeware 
TidyHTML, have low power in this tangle of disparate HTML coding practices.  
Even if HTML tags are completely stripped out from web pages before applying any 
NLP tool, the HTML imprint affects the textuality of a web page in several ways, from 
the unpredictable use of punctuation to the tiling of several unrelated texts in a single 
document.  
Chapter 3 - Issues about Linguistic Feature Extraction 
43  
In the following sections I will describe a few issues related to the application of a 
common NLP tool, namely the tagger-parser Connexor Machinese Syntax27 (henceforth 
Connexor) by Tapanainen and Järvinen (1997).  
3.2 Parsing Web Pages 
Connexor is based on a functional grammar, and outputs the baseform, or lemma, and 
four kinds of annotation: syntactic relations, functional tags (starting with @), syntactic 
tags (starting with %), and morphological tags, not preceded by any special prefix. An 
example of a parsed sentence by Connexor is in Figure 4. 
 
 
Figure 4. A sentence parsed by Connexor 
Connexor can handle HTML tags (an option is available to ignore HTML tagging). 
However, in order to get a more readable version, I converted all web pages into a text-
only format, using the freeware HTMLAsc, before submitting them to Connexor. 
The individual web page as a whole is taken as unit of analysis in this chapter and in all 
the experiments reported in the thesis. This means that a web page submitted to 
Connexor contains all the textual elements present in an HTML file, including menus, 
ads, buttons and so on, but not graphical elements. Programming code, like Javascript 
and similar, is usually removed by HTMLAsc, but it is difficult to say to what degree of 
perfection.

In the following subsection I will exemplify some problems that I noted when analysing 
a few parsed web pages. These problems are the following: (1) elements of text coded 
as images; (2) wrong parses, and finally (3) proper nouns. 
The web pages used as examples are from the SPIRIT collection (see Appendix A). The 
SPIRIT collection represents the open web, i.e. a fluid environment where web pages 
might be evolving, hybrid, individualised, or not following any genre convention.

we assume the final product ready for emission.

Chapter 3 - Issues about Linguistic Feature Extraction 
45  
If we compare the text-only version of the web page shown in Figure 6 with the HTML 
version of the same web page shown in Figure 5, we can note that some elements have 
disappeared from the text-only version. More precisely, all the items listed on the LHS 
side and the main headings are not present in the text-only version. This happens when 
elements of text are coded as images, which are then embedded in the HTML code. This 
loss of textual elements cannot be easily worked around.  
3.2.2 Issue 2: Wrong Parses 
Figure 7 shows a very common textual organization, i.e. lists. Lists can raise problems 
for stylometric measurements, such as average sentence length, and for syntactic 
parsing. Lists present a number of special traits that have been pointed out in Bouayad-
Agha et al. (1999). For instance, the introductory sentence of a list is usually 
semantically incomplete, and either lacks a final punctuation mark or ends with a colon. 
In Figure 7, there is a short list at the top, each item containing a few words without 
punctuation, and a longer list with an introductory sentence ending with a colon in the 
body. While the items in the short list are parsed correctly, the first item in the long list 
contains a wrong parse (Figure 8). Although this first item looks inconsistent with the 
other items in the long list (should ‘Review’ be ‘Reviewing’?), ‘Review’ is parsed as an 
attribute of the head ‘plan’, and not as a verb. A possible explanation could be that 
‘Review’ is not considered a verb by the parser because of its position at the beginning 
of a new sentence (verbs at the base form do not usually open a sentence in English, 
apart from imperatives). The colon followed by a new line is interpreted as a paragraph 
break by the parser and the syntactic link between the introductory sentence and the 
following item is lost. Whatever the explanation may be, this is a typical example of a 
parsed web page where the text can simply be ungrammatical or incoherent, or the NLP 
tool fails for any reason.  
Wrong parses can also be caused by tabular structures. Tabular structures, similar to that 
shown in Figure 9, are also common on the web. They are difficult to analyse from a 
linguistic standpoint, but they start to receive attention from the linguistic community 
(cf. Douglas and Hurst 1996; Say and Akman 1997; Hurst 2001). Here, I just want to 
Chapter 3 - Issues about Linguistic Feature Extraction 
 46
signal that such a difficult structure can be disorienting for the parser, which parses 
‘Questions’ as a verb (Figure 10). For the rest, Connexor does a very good job: all the 
numbers in the columns are parsed correctly.

3.2.3 Issue 3: Proper nouns 
Many web pages contain proper nouns, like the web page in Figure 11. It is not the task 
of a parser to identify them. However, one consequence of the segmentation applied by 
the parser to name entities is the amplification of the frequencies of nouns. As shown in 
Figure 12, a single entity as ‘Calvary Bible College’ will produce three nouns instead of 
one single entity.

3.3 Conclusion  
The list of issues could be extended, but the examples presented in the previous 
subsections are sufficient to highlight the problem: automatic feature extraction from 
web pages processed with NLP tools is not perfect, and can cause a number of 
miscalculations. Probably similar issues can occur in other running texts, not only in 
web pages. However, it is worth stressing that web pages in the open web (here 
represented by the SPIRIT collection) tend to be more unpredictable, and consequently 
more difficult, than documents contained in traditional corpora (like the BNC), which 
are normally built following some criteria and sometimes checked.  
The examples discussed in this chapter show that the application of a tagger-parser to 
web pages may entail some inaccuracies in the resulting analyses. However, these 
inaccuracies do not invalidate the use of NLP tools on web documents. In particular, 
Connexor does a very good job in many difficult cases (for example, it correctly parses 
the columns in the table shown in Figure 10). The identification of these and other 
issues aims only to encourage further refinement, because NLP tools are invaluable 
resources.  
The general advice that we can draw from these issues is to apply some caution when 
assessing results from any automatic approach to web pages. 
In the next two chapters, I will highlight the benefits of using the linguistic knowledge 
extracted from the Connexor tagger-parser, despite the problems pointed out in the 
present chapter.

Chapter 4 - POS Trigrams 
 50
 
Chapter 4.  POS Trigrams 
This chapter presents a first expansion of the range of features potentially useful for 
automatic genre identification: POS trigrams. POS trigrams, used in stylometry, are 
applied to genre categories found in the BNC to investigate whether they can be 
profitably employed as genre-revealing features.  
4.1 Introduction 
The goal of the set of experiments presented in this chapter is to investigate whether 
POS trigrams, i.e. a sequence of three morphological tags, can be profitably employed 
as genre-revealing features. In these experiments, POS trigrams are applied to 10 genre 
categories contained in the BNC. If POS trigrams prove to be discriminating in clean 
and organized documents like those included in the BNC, they will then be applied to 
web pages, a much noisier type of document, as shown in the previous chapter. If their 
performance is poor on the BNC, it will not be worth trying with web pages, because it 
will be not clear how much their performance can be overshadowed by the noise of web 
pages. Additionally, the BNC is provided with reliable morphological annotation, which 
has been partially checked and corrected. This is an ideal setting to investigate the 
potential of POS trigrams under optimal conditions. 
The use of POS trigrams for a classification task presupposes that texts are converted 
into POS tags (similar to the text shown in Figure 13). On this converted version, 
frequencies of POS triples – similar to those shown in Table 2 – are calculated.

Table 2. Examples of POS trigrams 
Argamon et al. (1998) have already tested POS trigrams on textual styles of magazines 
and newspapers – such as The New York Times news, The New York Times editorials, 
The New York Daily News, and Newsweek – with good results. The experiments 
described in the following sections will show whether POS trigrams are also effective 
for automatic genre identification. 
In the next section I will describe the subset of the BNC employed for this set of 
experiments, and explain how the POS trigrams used for genre discrimination have been 
selected. 
Chapter 4 - POS Trigrams

4.2 BNC Genres and POS Trigrams 
BNC Genres. From the BNC, I selected a subset of documents belonging to 10 
different genre categories28. I included four spoken genres and six written genres, as 
shown in Table 3.

Table 3.The 10 genres selected from the BNC 
Each genre was represented by 15 documents. In order to have a very manageable 
working corpus, I cut each document to 300 sentences because some documents were 
very long and some very short. The number of words per document ranged between 
1,500 and 7,500.  
POS trigrams. As mentioned earlier, the BNC is provided tagged. The tagset used in 
the BNC is CLAWS5 (Aston and Burnard, 1998: 230-234). POS trigrams rely on the 
morphological annotation returned by taggers, usually more accurate than parsers. 
Although POS trigrams are based on POS tagging, they represent a shallow approach to 
syntax. This means that syntactic information is captured implicitly from the 
juxtaposition of morphological tags. For example, the sequence ‘ADV ADJ NOUN’ may 
signal a subordinating relation in the text.  
Argamon et al. (1998) argued that POS trigrams are “large enough to encode useful 
syntactic information, and small enough to be computationally manageable”. In other 
                                                 
28 I used the BNC Indexer to select the genres used in these experiments. The detailed description of this 
tool is in Lee (2001).  
Chapter 4 - POS Trigrams 
 53
words, the triple represents, in their view, the optimal trade off between the amount of 
syntactic information and the number of elements in the morphological sequence.  
Additionally, having a manageable number of n-grams is important because thousands 
of possible combinations of POS tags are produced for a corpus. For this reason, only a 
subset of the available POS trigrams is selected. The rationale behind POS trigram 
selection is that a POS trigram should not be too common and not too rare in order to be 
discriminating. There are several ways of setting the thresholds for potentially 
discriminating POS trigrams. In these experiments, I included only POS trigrams with a 
frequency of occurrence between 30 and 100 in each document. After this first 
selection, I grouped all the selected POS trigrams from the 10 genres, and weeded out 
those trigrams that occurred in more than three genres. Other methods are possible, 
which are described later (see footnotes 38, 46 and 67). 
In the next section, I will provide technical details about the experiments, and discuss 
the results. 
4.3 Methodology 
POS trigrams were computed using the freeware kfNgram. I created two set of POS 
trigrams, one including punctuation symbols, the other without any punctuation. From 
these two sets, I selected the potentially discriminating POS trigrams applying a 
threshold as described in the previous section. 
Then, I created four different sets of POS trigrams. The first set contained a list of 835 
POS trigrams, not including punctuation. The second included a list of 1,033 POS 
trigrams, including punctuation. The third set contained a list of 65 POS trigrams 
automatically filtered out from the 835 POS trigrams without punctuation. Finally, the 
fourth set contained a list 74 POS trigrams automatically filtered out from the 1,033 
POS trigrams with punctuation. The automatic filter used to automatically filter out the 
Chapter 4 - POS Trigrams 
 54
first and the second sets of POS trigrams in order to produce the third and fourth set is 
included in the Weka machine learning workbench (Witten and Frank, 2005)29. 
I ended up with 16 datasets, which varied for number of genres, number of features, and 
the presence or absence of punctuation symbols (see Tabels 3, 4, 5). 
Once the datasets were assembled, the discriminating power of the selected lists of POS 
was tested using a supervised machine learning classifier, the Naive Bayes classifier 
included in the Weka machine learning workbench (Witten and Frank, 2005). I chose 
this learning algorithm because it showed a better accuracy than decision tree classifiers 
(Weka J48 and See530), and instance-based or memory-based classifiers (respectively 
Weka Ibk and TiMBL31). 
I ran the Naive Bayes classifier with a nonparametric technique, the kernel density 
estimation, that bypasses the requirement of normal distribution32. John and Langley 
(1995) showed that the Bayesian classifier's performance could be much improved if the 
traditional treatment of numeric attributes, which assumes normal distributions, is 
replaced by kernel density estimation which, on the other hand, does not assume any 
particular distribution for attribute values.  
A standard technique to ensure that results are representative and reliable is cross-
validation with stratification. In cross-validation, each fold – i.e. a partition of data – is 
used in turn for testing while the remainder is used for training. Stratification refers to 
the random sampling of both training and test sets (Witten and Frank, 2005: 149-151). 
The standard evaluation technique, in situations where only a small amount of data is 
employed to build a classifier – as in the present situation – is stratified tenfold cross-
                                                 
29 I used the command weka.filters.AttributeSelectionFilter with BestFirst as 
search technique, and CfsSubsetEval as evaluation class.

function (the kernel) is averaged across the observed data points to create a smooth approximation.

validation. Since a single tenfold cross-validation might not be enough to get a reliable 
error estimate, it is a standard procedure to repeat the cross-validation process 10 times, 
and then average the results. All the findings presented in the next subsection comply 
with this approach. 
4.3.1 Results  
In the tables shown in this subsection, column 1, Genres, shows how genres have been 
grouped together, namely All (all genres), Written (written genres), Spoken (spoken 
genres), SP vs Wr (spoken genres versus written genres); column 2, Features, indicates 
if the full set of POS trigrams (All) or filtered POS trigrams (Selected) has been used; 
column 3, No Punct, and 4, Punct, report the accuracies of the feature sets, without or 
with punctuation respectively. 
POS Trigrams 
From Table 4, it appears that the set of POS trigrams without punctuation tends to 
perform better than the set with punctuation, with some exceptions. For Spoken- 
Selected, and Sp vs Wr-All, the average accuracy with punctuation is slightly higher. In 
one case, the average accuracy is exactly the same, with and without punctuation, 
namely Sp vs Wr-Selected.  
 
 
Table 4. Average accuracies of POS trigrams 
 The datasets with selected features tend to perform better than those with the full set of 
features, with the exception of Spoken genres and Sp vs Wr. 
Chapter 4 - POS Trigrams 
 56
The worst performance is registered for Written-All, with and without punctuation. 
Interestingly, when selected features are used (Written-Selected), classification results 
are definitely better, with and without punctuation.  
All in all, accuracy results are very high. POS trigrams appear to be a very promising 
automatically-extractable genre-revealing feature. In order to investigate whether POS 
trigrams represent the ideal number of elements in the morphological sequence, in the 
next paragraph I report the results achieved with POS bigrams and POS unigrams.  
POS Bigrams and Unigrams 
For POS bigrams and unigrams, I replicated the experimental setting used for POS 
trigrams.  
I ended up with four sets for POS bigrams, and two sets for POS unigrams. More 
specifically, for POS bigrams, I collected 451 bigrams without punctuation and 568 
with punctuation; 36 bigrams selected from the set without punctuation, and 41 selected 
from the set with punctuation. For POS unigrams, I ended up with 20 unigrams without 
punctuation, and 24 unigrams with punctuation. I did not apply any filter to POS 
unigrams because the number of features was low. 
In total, I had 16 datasets for POS bigrams and eight datasets for POS unigrams.  
Classification results are shown in Table 5 for POS bigrams, and Table 6 for POS 
unigrams.  
Overall, accuracy results reported in Table 5 and Table 6 show that the classification 
accuracy achieved with POS bigrams and unigrams is lower than the accuracy achieved 
with POS trigrams. In order to measure whether these differences are statistically 
significant, I computed the chi-square test of significance using the online chi-square 
calculator33. The test suggests that there is a substantial advantage in using POS bigrams 
instead of POS unigrams, while there is only a slight benefit in using POS bigrams

instead of POS trigrams. It will be worth exploring in future the effectiveness of larger 
units, like 4-grams or 5-grams.

4.3.2 Comparison with Argamon et al. (1998) 
As stated above, this set of experiments is based on that of Argamon et al. (1998) with 
some differences: 
• The set of experiment presented in this chapter only focused on frequencies of POS n-grams 
in documents. 
o Argamon et al. (1998) also used a set of 500 function words. 
• I used 10 genre categories from the BNC. Each genre category included 15 documents; each 
document was cut to 300 sentences, and the number of words per document ranged between 
1,500 and 7,500.  
o Argamon et al. (1998) used four text collections (NY Times news, NY Times 
editorial, NY Daily News, Newsweek). Each collection included 200 documents, 
and documents contained between 300 and 1,300 words. 
 
Chapter 4 - POS Trigrams 
 58
• In my experiments, four different sets of POS trigrams (based on CLAWS5 tagger) were 
tried (with and without punctuation; filtered and not filtered). I selected POS n-grams with a 
frequency of occurrence between 30 and 100 in a single genre collection; after this first 
selection, I ruled out those n-grams with a frequency of occurrence greater than 3.  
o Argamon et al. (1998) used a list of 685 POS trigrams (based on Brill's tagger), 
including punctuation. They selected those trigrams that appear in between 25% 
and 75% of the documents in their corpus, and counted the frequencies of 
occurrence of each trigram.   
 
• I used a Naive Bayes classifier with kernel density estimation.  
o Argamon et al. (1998) used a decision-tree learning algorithms (Ripper classifier).  
 
• In this experiment, the collections were tested in the following ways: 10 genres altogether, 
spoken against written, only spoken, only written.  
o In Argamon et al. (1998), the collections were tested for pairwise distinguishability, 
which means that two collections at time were compared. 
 
• I used a 10-fold cross-validation repeated 10 times, in order to get the average accuracy.  
o In Argamon et al. (1998), a single five-fold cross-validation was used.  
 
In brief, the results reported in Argamon et al. (1998) are not directly comparable with 
my results. However, some comparisons can be made. 
Their best result with POS trigrams (as already noted, they also used function words) is 
79.6% for pairwise distinguishability (namely, Daily News vs. Newsweek). This means 
that they achieved an accuracy 29.6% above the random expectation of 50%. This is a 
good result, if we consider that their textual collections belong to journalistic styles, 
where variation is certainly less pronounced than, say, ACADEMIC PROSE vs. 
CONVERSATION.  
My worst result with POS trigrams on 10 genre categories is 81.1%, i.e. about 70% 
above the random expectation of 10%. My worst performance with POS trigrams and 
pairwise distinguishability (namely, Sp vs Wr) is 98.4%, i.e. about 48% above the 
random expectation of 50%. 
In sum, the performance of POS trigrams on the BNC genres is very encouraging.

4.3.3 Discussion  
The aim of the set of experiments presented in this chapter was to investigate if POS 
trigrams could be used as genre-revealing features. According to the results reported in 
the previous subsections, the answer is definitely positive. As already pointed out, the 
BNC represents an ideal corpus because it is clean, and has a highly reliable POS 
annotation. In these conditions POS trigrams perform very well. Therefore, if POS 
trigrams are not equally effective on web page collections, it will probably depend on 
level of noise that might be present in that type of documents. I will test the efficiency 
of POS trigrams on web pages later in this thesis (Chapter 10). 
Here, I would like to make some additional considerations. First, POS trigrams are 
corpus-dependent. In other words, they must be re-computed from scratch when 
exported to a corpus that has a different genre palette from the corpus they have been 
computed upon (cf. also Section 6.2.2). Second, POS trigrams are linguistically opaque. 
This means that a long list of POS sequences, like those shown in Table 2, does not 
provide any intuitive textual insight into a document. A third concern about the 
experiments described in this chapter regards overfitting. Overfitting is the phenomenon 
by which a classifier is tuned to the “contingent” characteristics of training data, rather 
than the “constitutive” characteristic of the category (Sebastiani, 2002: 15). Overfitting 
usually occurs when a statistical model has too many parameters. Cross-validation is a 
technique that helps overcome overfitting. Yet the suspicion is that when the corpus is 
very small, and especially when the number of examples per genre is limited and the 
number of features is high, overfitting occurs despite cross-validation. In order to avoid 
overfitting, the bigger the features set, the more examples are needed (Sebastiani, 2005). 
However, it is not clear how many examples should be provided for each feature. 
Additionally, some classifiers are more sensitive to overfitting than others, for example, 
with support vectors overfitting is not common (Witten and Frank, 2005: 217), while it 
represents a drawback with neural networks (Witten and Frank, 2005: 233) and 
Bayesian approaches (Witten and Frank, 2005: 268). Therefore, the selection of the 
classifier has its own weight on overfitting. Problems with overfitting were already 
pointed out by Kessler et al. (1997). However, they have not been addressed so far, and 
Chapter 4 - POS Trigrams 
 60
they are not the object of this thesis either. They deserve a thorough exploration in 
future research. 
The encouraging results achieved by POS trigrams on a small subset of the BNC will be 
compared with the results coming from the application of POS trigrams to a much 
larger and noisier collection of web pages later in this thesis (see Discussion in Section 
10.3.5). 
4.4 Conclusion 
The set of experiments presented in this chapter showed that POS trigrams can be used 
effectively as genre-revealing features on a clean and standardized corpus, like the 
BNC. Since POS trigrams represent a shallow approach to syntax, these experiments 
also indicate that syntactic features can return profitable results for automatic genre 
classification. 
These findings encourage the application of POS trigrams to a larger and less 
standardized document collection drawn from the web. 
However, before applying POS trigrams to web pages, in the next chapter I continue my 
investigation on another type of complex features, the facets. 
*~*~*~*
Chapter 5 - The Facets 
 61
 
Chapter 5.  The Facets 
This chapter presents a second expansion of the range of features useful for automatic 
genre identification: the facets. While POS trigrams described in the previous chapter 
represent a shallow approach to syntax and are linguistically opaque, facets fully exploit 
the syntactic information returned by a parser, and provide more insight into the 
communicative purposes that can be found in texts.  
5.1 Introduction 
As shown in the previous chapter, POS trigrams are features where the syntactic 
information is derived from the sequence of morphological tags in a syntagmatic 
relation. POS trigrams are ‘shallow’ because syntactic information is simply derived by 
relying on the juxtaposition of morphological tags, without any analysis of the resulting 
sequences.  
The goal of the present chapter is to present the facets, a type of feature that is not 
shallow. Rather, facets provide insights into different aspects of a text. I chose the name 
‘facets’ because these features highlight different aspects – or facets – of 
communication. Arguably, these different aspects of communication are useful for the 
automatic identification of genre. 
5.2 What is a Facet? 
Broadly speaking, the word ‘facet’ indicates an ‘aspect’ of a situation, a concept, an 
issue, and so on. 
The word ‘facet’ combined with the ‘classification’ or ‘analysis’ indicates a particular 
approach to bibliographical classification. As noted in Chapter 2, facet analysis or 
Chapter 5 - The Facets 
 62
facetted classification has been recently borrowed from librarian studies by information 
studies as a possible solution for the slipperiness of the concept of genre.  
In this thesis, the term ‘facet’ is not linked to this line of research. More simply, I use 
the term ‘facet’ to indicate an ‘aspect’ in the communicative context that is reflected in 
the use of the language. The denomination of ‘facet’ should emphasize that linguistic 
and textual traits represent an aspect of communication that can be interpreted for 
deriving text types or genres. 
My facets are features, or better, macro-features. That is, a facet may contain several 
micro-features. For example, the first person facet includes first person pronouns, 
singular and plural (see Figure 14). The first person facet indicates that communication 
context is related to the text producer, i.e. the speaker or the writer. A high frequency of 
first person facets in a text signals an impressionistic or subjective stance of the text 
producer. While in previous genre classification approaches, pronouns were used 
individually without any further interpretation (e.g. see Figure 15), with the first person 
facet my aim is to interpret, or assess, whether first person pronouns indicate a 
particular stance in communication, and if this stance is linked to a genre or text type. 
For instance, a high frequency of first person facet is often used in ARGUMENTATIVE 
genres, like COMMENTS and OPINIONS that can be found in newspapers and magazines.

Figure 15. The 20 features used in Karlgren and Cutting (1994) 
Facets are inspired by Biber’s features. Biber was the first to include in his feature set 
those features that could be ‘functionally-interpreted’. In Chapter 2, I pointed out that 
the notion of ‘function’ is fundamental to Biber’s approach. In his feature set, Biber 
includes those linguistic attributes that can be linked to the variation in the 
communicative situation. In proposing the facets, my aim is the same: I wish to create a 
link between the attributes (not necessarily only linguistic in my case) that can be 
automatically extracted from a text and the situation – or better the communicative 
context – where these attributes are used and instantiated. Many of my facets are similar 
to Biber’s features, for example the first person pronouns or the passives. 
Facets should not be confused with Biber’s factors. As already mentioned, Biber 
invented a corpus-based approach called the ‘multi-dimensional analysis’. This 
approach relies on factor analysis. Factor analysis returns factors, i.e. groups of features 
clustered together according to their variance34. A first difference is that facets are not 
                                                 
34 Variance is a measure of variability about the mean used largely for computational purposes. The 
variance is the sum of squared deviations divided by N – 1 (George and Mallery, 2000). 
Chapter 5 - The Facets 
 64
assembled according to any mathematical algorithms; they are simply a collection of 
individual features that share a similar textual interpretation according to previous 
studies. Furthermore, Biber interprets factors in terms of textual dimensions, or broadly 
speaking, text types. Figure 16 shows one of the factors, namely Factor 2, produced in 
the factor analysis carried out in Biber (1988). According to Biber (1988: 108-109), 
Factor 2 corresponds to the textual dimension of NARRATIVE vs. NON-NARRATIVE 
CONCERNS. In the positive part of the factor (the upper part in Figure 16), the narrative-
ness is expressed by the emphasis given on past events (past tense verbs) involving 
specific animate participants (3rd person pronouns); public verbs as markers of reported 
speech (e.g. ‘assert’, ‘declare’, ‘say’, etc.) and so on. Hence, the second difference is 
that facets do not go as far as Biber’s factors. Facets do not correspond to text types, but 
to the features that can be found in a text type.  
 
 
Figure 16. Factor 2 from Biber (1988) 
Simply put, facets are similar to Biber’s features, though not identical. With facets, I 
further elaborate the initial 67 features suggested in Biber (1988), including more 
‘aspects’.  
In my approach, facets subsume several subtypes (schematically shown in Figure 17). 
The main division is between linguistic facets and HTML facets. While HTML facets 
do not encompass any other subtype at this stage of research, linguistic facets include 
Chapter 5 - The Facets 
 65
functional cues, syntactic patterns, and other facets. This latter type of facets has still an 
embryonic form. 
Both linguistic and HTML facets stress aspects of communication. More precisely, 
while linguistic facets focus on linguistic or textual aspects, HTML facets highlight the 
layout format and functionality attributes that can characterize written or digital 
communication. Both can be considered an extension of Biber’s features, in the sense 
that they contain a ‘functional’ interpretation of textual traits. 
 
 
Figure 17. Relations between facets 
In the following sections I will describe the facets in more detail starting with linguistic 
facets.  
5.3 Linguistic Facets 
Linguistic facets are based on the linguistic knowledge that can be extracted by NLP 
tools. In this first version of linguistic facets I used the Connexor tagger-parser. Ideally, 
other parsers and/or several NLP tools can be used at the same time to enrich the first 
version of facets presented here. 
As mentioned above, linguistic facets subsume three sets of features: functional cues 
(Section 5.3.1), syntactic patterns (Section 5.3.2), and other facets (Section 5.3.4).  
Chapter 5 - The Facets 
 66
Functional cues are a direct amplification of Biber’s features and are listed in Table 7. 
Syntactic patterns are new and are listed in Table 11, Table 12, and Table 13. The ‘other 
facets’ are still under construction; in this thesis I present the genre-specific-word facets 
described in Section 5.3.4. 
An example of a functional cue facet is shown in Figure 18, an example of syntactic 
pattern facet in shown in Figure 19, and finally an example of genre-specific-word facet 
is shown in Figure 24. 
As explained earlier, facets are functionally-interpreted macro-features. For instance, 
fhe nominal functional cue shown in Figure 18 includes nouns, prepositional phrases, 
adjectives, appositions and so on. The interpration of this facet is that a high frequency 
of nominal material indicates density of information (Biber, 1988: 105). Density of 
information is often present in INFORMATIONAL genres, like FEATURE ARTICLES.

Chapter 5 - The Facets 
 67
Similarly, the concessive syntactic patterns shown in Figure 19 include several 
concessive subordinators positioned in different part of the sentence (initial or final 
position). Concessive clauses discomfirm the expectations expressed in the main clause. 
They are widely used in ARGUMENTATION and all argumentative genres like EDITORIALS 
or COMMENTS (Werlich, 1976: 260). 
 
 
Figure 19. Example of a facet: the concessive syntactic patterns 
The detailed description and motivation of all the linguistic facets included in this thesis 
is contained in Appendix B.  
The theoretical motivation of linguistic facets is based on four grammars (Quirk et al., 
1972; Werlich, 1976, Quirk et al., 1985, Biber et al., 1999), and a corpus-based study on 
language variation (Biber, 1988). These resources are briefly described in the next 
subsection. 
Description of the resources 
The linguistic resources mentioned above have something in common: they provide an 
interpretation of the features according to different kinds of texts. Werlich (1976), Biber 
(1988) and Biber et al. (1999) make this intent explicit. In Quirk et al. (1972) and Quirk 
Chapter 5 - The Facets 
 68
et al. (1985), on the other hand, the reference to the use of some linguistic phenomena in 
different kind of texts is more occasional.  
Werlich belongs to the German tradition of ‘textlinguistik’. His text grammar is a 
descriptive grammar, where claims are supported by examples from real texts. 
However, he does not rely on any corpus-based evidence (the corpus-based approach 
was not widespread in the mid-70s, especially outside the UK). The linguistic and 
textual features described in Werlich (1976) are mainly taken from Quirk et al. (1972). 
The value added by Werlich is the description of the use of these features across five 
text types: DESCRIPTION, NARRATION, EXPOSITION, ARGUMENTATION and INSTRUCTION. He 
uses a peculiar terminology, not linked to the English-speaking linguistic tradition, and 
hypothesizes “five dominant contextual foci that can be observed in all texts” (Werlich, 
1976: 19): a spatial focus or context for descriptive texts; a temporal focus or context 
for narrative texts; a focus on concepts for expository texts; a focus on relations between 
concepts for argumentative texts; a focus on future behaviour for instructional texts. His 
text grammar is based on the hypothesis that texts are “conceived of as assignable to 
text types [and] primarily derive their structural distinctions from innate cognitive 
properties” (Werlich, 1976: 21). In his view, the five basic text types reflect the basic 
cognitive processes of contextual organization: description relates to “perception in 
space”; narration is linked to “perception in time”; exposition depends on the 
“comprehension of general concepts”; argumentation relies on “judging”; instruction is 
based on “planning”. The contribution of Werlich’s text grammar is that it provides 
breakdowns of linguistic and textual features for each text type, for example the features 
that he lists for objective NARRATION are the 3rd person point of view, the 1st person 
plural point of view, the past tense, the indication of exact time and location, and so on 
(Werlich, 1976: 59 ff.). These features have the potential to be useful for any automatic 
genre and text type identification.  
While Werlich’s text types derive from a cognitive interpretation of texts in relation to 
text producer, text receiver(s), external context and so on, Biber’s text types (Biber, 
1988, 1989, 1995, 2004a, 2004b) are corpus-based, statistically extracted with factor 
analysis and interpreted in terms of “textual dimensions” (Biber, 1988: 104 ff.). 
Chapter 5 - The Facets 
 69
Although not universally accepted (cf. Lee, 1999), Biber’s approach represents a 
remarkable contribution to corpus-based linguistic analysis. 
Biber (1988) dedicates a whole chapter (namely, Chapter 2) to the communicative 
functions served by linguistic features. This functional interpretation of linguistic 
elements is incorporated into the grammar by Biber et al. (1999: 41-44). Biber et al. 
(1999) is entirely corpus-based. The corpus built for this grammar is the LGSWE 
Corpus (i.e. the Longman Spoken and Written English Corpus) that contains over 40 
million words of text (Biber et al., 1999: 24). It has been constructed to provide a 
representation of different registers35, namely: conversation, fiction, news, and 
academic prose. Each grammatical feature is described across the four registers 
following a regular structure: first a description of the grammatical feature in question; 
then a section called “Corpus Findings” where the distributional patterns of the 
grammatical features are shown; finally a section called “Discussion of the Findings” 
where the discourse patterns described quantitatively are interpreted in functional terms 
(Biber et al., 1999: 41). This grammar represents a unique linguistic resource. 
Quirk et al. (1972) is used here mostly in an indirect way, but it is important because it 
is the foundation of Werlich (1976). 
Quirk et al. (1985) is an invaluable descriptive grammar for English, which is only 
partially corpus-based (Quirk et al., 1985: 33). It is interspersed with remarks about 
formality and other situational dimensions reflected in the language. For example, for a 
construction such as the “verbless temporal clause with until in final position”, as in 
Beat the mixture until fluffy, is “common in instructional texts” (Quirk et al. 
1985: 1079).  
                                                 
35 It is worth noting that the term ‘register’ is used by Biber “as a cover term associated to all aspects of 
variation in use” (Biber, 1995: 9).

5.3.1 Functional Cues 
Functional cues are mainly based on Connexor’s functional tags (i.e. tags starting with 
an @ sign according to the Connexor annotation scheme36, for example @SUBJ), to a 
minor extent on syntactic relations (for example, loc:> or tmp:>), and on a number of 
base forms or lemmas (for example, the base forms of semantic classes of verbs). The 
list of functional cues included in this first set of linguistic facets is shown in Table 7. 
For each of them, the detailed description together with the annotation tags and lexical 
items used in the extraction process can be found in Appendix B.

2.  complex NPs 23. communication verbs 
3.  nominals 24. mental verbs 
4.  first person 25. causative verbs

patterns.

5.3.2 Syntactic Patterns 
Syntactic patterns return useful information about (a) adverbial clauses (Subsection 
5.3.2.1), (b) complement clauses (Subsection 5.3.2.2) and (c) main clauses (Subsection 
5.3.2.3).  
The idea that certain genres or writing styles favour certain syntactic constructions is 
not new (cf. e.g. Biber, 1988: 229-230; Baayen et al., 1996; Aaronson, 2000; Stamatatos 
et al., 2001). However, even if syntax is acknowledged to have discriminating power, it 
has often been neglected, as discussed in Chapter 2. The 67 linguistic features selected 
by Biber more than 15 years ago (Biber 1988: 73-75, 221-245) are based mainly on 
word identification, even when the features are really syntactic, because NLP tools were 
quite limited at that time. For example, the identification of adverbial clauses is based 
on the presence of specific subordinators, such as although and though for concessive 
clauses, and because for causative clauses. However, the lexically based approach to 
syntax is quite limited, because subordinators can be ambiguous. To overcome the 
ambiguity issue, Biber used only unambiguous subordinators; for example because is 
the only causative subordinator included in his features, being the only one “to function 
unambiguously as a causative adverbial. Other forms, such as as, for and since, can 
have a range of functions, including causative” (Biber, 1988: 236).  
As far as I am aware, syntactic patterns of any kind have never been tried for genre and 
text type identification. Instead, surface or syntactic patterns are regularly used for 
information extraction (IE) and question answering (QA) as, for example, in 
Ravichandran et al., (2003), Ravichandran and Hovy (2002), Hovy et al. (2002), 
Soubbotin and Soubbotin (2001), and Riloff (1996). The idea behind the use of these 
patterns is that certain types of answers and certain types of information are expressed 
using characteristic phrases. Therefore with questions like “When was X born?”, typical 
answers are: “Mozart was born in 1756”, “Gandhi (1869-1948)”, etc. Patterns for such 
answers could be: NAME was born in BIRTHDATE, NAME (BIRTHDATE- (from 
Ravichandran and Hovy, 2002). For extracting information about ‘bombing’, a pattern 
such as SUBJ was bombed by PP would return information such as “World Trade 
Chapter 5 - The Facets 
 72
Center was bombed by terrorists” (from AutoSlogTS flowchart, Riloff, 1996). The 
purpose of such patterns is to extract snippets of content by making use of some 
syntactic components to guarantee a certain degree of generalization. By contrast, the 
aim of syntactic patterns described in this section is to label sentences at clause level, 
and use this kind of annotation to extract more complex features. 
To my knowledge, there are no public corpora available with annotation at clause level, 
such as manner clause, space clause and so on, or at sentence level37.  
With syntactic patterns, I explore the possibility of using grammars as a corpus of 
syntactically annotated examples at clause level. Annotated examples copied from 
grammars do not require any further annotation or confirmation by humans, as they 
represent points of reference of linguistic knowledge.  
Syntactic pattern creation and detection involve the following steps, represented 
graphically in Figure 20:  
• Copying examples of subordinate clauses or sentence types from grammars (namely 
Werlich, 1976; Quirk et al. 1985; Biber et al. 1999) into single files, one file for each 
syntactic construction.  
• Parsing the files containing the examples of syntactic constructions.  
• Tabulating the parses in a convenient form, more specifically restoring the horizontal 
alignment from the Connexor vertical output (see Steps 2 and 3 below). 
• Creating a set of patterns for each syntactic construction by identifying the common 
elements of the parses for each syntactic construction and replacing the optional elements 
with regular expressions. 
• Creating of an algorithm to identify the sets of patterns in running texts.

37 As already mentioned, the BNC includes only morphological annotation, the Penn Treebank II 
Bracketing allows only extraction of predicate-argument structure and the recent Penn Discourse 
Treebank, available at <http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~pdtb/>, contains information about discourse 
structure. 
Chapter 5 - The Facets 
 73
All the steps will be described in detail taking as an example the creation and the 
detection of some patterns of the concessive clause. 
Step 1: Grammars as a Corpus of Examples: The Concessive Clause 
The examples of clause of concession were copied into a file from Quirk et al. (1985: 
1097-1102) and Biber et al. (1999: 818-827). 
Step 2: Parsing 
The file was parsed in Connexor and a parse was returned for each example (wrong 
parses were not used to build patterns). 
For instance, the sentence: 
<!-- : Although he had just joined the company, he was treated exactly 
like all the other employees.--> 
was parsed as shown in Table 8. 
1 Although although pm:>5 @CS %CS CS 
2 he He subj:>3 @SUBJ %NH PRON PERS NOM SG3 
3 had have v-ch:>5 @+FAUXV %AUX V PAST 
4 just just meta:>5 @ADVL %EH ADV 
5 joined join cnd:>11 @-FMAINV %VA EN 
6 the the det:>7 @DN> %>N DET 
7 company company obj:>5 @OBJ %NH N NOM 
8 , ,   
9 he he subj:>10 @SUBJ %NH PRON PERS NOM SG3 
10 was be v-ch:>11 @+FAUXV %AUX V PAST 
11 treated treat main:>0 @-FMAINV %VP EN 
12 exactly exactly man:>11 @ADVL %EH ADV

18 . .   
19 <s> <s>   
 
Table 8. A sentence with a concessive clause parsed by Connexor 
Chapter 5 - The Facets 
 74
Step 3: Creating the Patterns 
As described in Chapter 3, Connexor returns several types of annotation. For the 
creation of syntactic patterns, I gave priority to functional annotation, i.e. the annotation 
starting with an @ sign, occasionally integrated by other types of annotation. For 
example, I included the syntactic relation main:> that identifies the main verb in the 
whole sentence, or lexical items, such as although, to represent subordinators. A 
simple algorithm based on string manipulation cleared out all unused information of the 
parses, and returned patterns similar to the following example: 
<!-- : Although he had just joined the company, he was treated exactly 
like all the other employees.--> 
although@CS @SUBJ have@FAUXV @ADVL FMAINV_EN @DN> @OBJ , @SUBJ 
be@FAUXV main_FMAINV_EN @ADVL @ADVL @DN> @DN> @DN> @NH  
 
Reading such a pattern is very easy. The legend in Box 1: 
although@CS = ‘although’ in the role of subordinate conjunction 
@SUBJ  = subject of the clause 
have@FAUXV = ‘have’ as auxiliary 
@ADVL  = adverb 
FMAINV_EN = past participle 
@DN>  = determiner 
@OBJ  = object 
be@FAUXV = ‘be’ as auxiliary 
main_FMAINV = main verb in the sentence 
@ADVL  = adverb 
@NH  = noun head 
Box 1. Legend of a syntactic pattern 
Chapter 5 - The Facets 
 75
Step 4: Manual Identification of Common Elements across Patterns  
What are the common elements between the two following patterns? 
Sentence 1: 
<!-- : Although he had just joined the company, he was treated exactly 
like all the other employees.--> 
although@CS @SUBJ have@FAUXV @ADVL FMAINV_EN @DN> @OBJ , @SUBJ 
be@FAUXV main_FMAINV_EN @ADVL @ADVL @DN> @DN> @DN> @NH  
 
Sentence 2: 
<!-- : Although Sam had told the children a bedtime story, June told 
them one too. --> 
although@CS @SUBJ have@FAUXV FMAINV_EN @DN> @I-OBJ @DN> @A> @OBJ , 
@SUBJ main_FMAINV_PAST @I-OBJ @OBJ @ADVL  
 
It’s very easy to detect: both start with ‘although’, both have a subject followed by a 
verb in the subordinate clause, both have a subject and a main verb in the matrix clause. 
Hence, the common elements are:  
although@CS @SUBJ FMAINV @SUBJ main_FMAINV 
 
In order to make this pattern flexible and open to any number of optional elements 
occurring between each component, I can simply use regular expressions (provided by 
many programming languages). The use of a ‘non-greedy’ quantifier (i.e. a quantifier 
that finds the minimum number of characters matching the pattern) makes the algorithm 
more efficient. In many cases, the metacharacters *? are enough to meet the need of 
flexibility. The pattern filled in by regular expressions has the following form: 
although@CS.*?@SUBJ.*?FMAINV.*?@SUBJ.*?main_FMAINV 
 
and matches both examples of sentences containing a concessive clause. 
Step 5: Creation of an Algorithm to Identify Patterns in Running Texts 
Step 4 was repeated for all the examples of syntactic construction copied from the 
grammars. For each subclause and sentence type a set of patterns was built, and a 
Chapter 5 - The Facets 
 76
straightforward algorithm to detect them in running texts was created. Each set of 
patterns was searched by a subroutine, similar to the snippet shown in Figure 21. 
 
 
Figure 21. Example of a subroutine written in Perl to detect the patterns of concessive clause 
 
Why not use machine learning? 
In a preliminary experiment, I tried to build a classifier capabable of learning a number 
of patterns. Howerver, the results of this attempt were not very encouraging.  
At that time, I created two feature sets: one based on Connexor functional tags, the other 
on Connexor syntactic relations. Then I counted the tags in each pattern. For example, 
the complex noun phrase the industrially advanced countries with the pattern 
DN> AD-A> A> NH <s>  was represented by a record with following format: 
A> +FMAINV -FAUXV -FMAINV <AD-A <NOM DN> <P NH etc. 
1      0      0      0     1      0   1   0  1  
Figure 22. Snippet of a record representing a syntactic pattern for machine learning 
Chapter 5 - The Facets 
 77
I selected 12 syntactic constructions for the learning task, namely: 
Modifier + Noun Phrase     
Verb + that-clause    
ADJective + that-clause  
that-omission    
that-retention   
Verb + wh-clause      
V + inf-clause     
V + ing-clause     
ADJective + ing-clause

The training corpus comprised 108 sentences and the test corpus 12 sentences, one per 
category. Despite the small test set, accuracy was poor, as shown in Table 9 and Table

Table 10. Classification accuracy with syntactic relations 
The best accuracy, 75%, was achieved with the syntactic relation dataset and a decision 
tree classifier. I considered this accuracy too low given the favourable proportions of 
training set and test set.  
Learning syntactic patterns is not an easy task. First, representing the linearity of a 
string in a classifier is not trivial. The position of a tag, or a word, is very important in 
Chapter 5 - The Facets 
 78
syntax. The experiment above does not take into account the position of the tag, only 
the presence and the frequency of it in a sentence. The position could be incorporated in 
the vector, but this would lead to a larger feature space and to other complexities (cf. 
Mitchell, 1997: 180 ff.). Additionally, the multilabelling of a single sentence (a sentence 
can include several subordinate clauses) represents another hard task to tackle with 
machine learning. For all these reasons, I thought that string manipulation and pattern 
matching could be more effective and simple to implement than a machine-learning 
approach to syntactic patterns. 
Advantages of syntactic patterns 
1) With syntactic patterns, unusual constructions can be easily identified, without 
creating any noise, as in the case of:  
Naked as I was, I braved the storm. 
@PCOMPL-S as@CS @SUBJ be_FMAINV , @SUBJ main_FMAINV @DN> @OBJ  
 
In this pattern, there is a subject complement, followed by as in the role of conjunction, 
followed by a subject, followed by a verb be, followed by another subject, followed by 
a main verb, and so on. This patter is unambiguous and easy to detect. 
2) Syntactic patterns can help detect the position of the subclause in a sentence. For 
example, it is possible to determine if a subclause is in an intial position, final position 
or incidental. The position of a subclause in a sentence can provide hints about 
registers/genres, as indicated in Biber et al. (1999: 831).  
3) Some subordinators can be easily disambiguated, for example though: 
No goals were scored, though it was an exciting game. 
@DN> @SUBJ @FAUXV main_FMAINV , though@CS @SUBJ FMAINV @DN> @A> 
@PCOMPL-S  
 
It cannot be confused with:     
He went, though  
even if the parser makes a tagging mistake.  
Chapter 5 - The Facets 
 79
4) More importantly, several subordinate clauses can be identified in a single sentence. 
For example: 
Although Sam had told the children a bedtime story, June told them one 
too, because she was eager to see their reaction. 
both patterns:  although@CS @SUBJ.*?FMAINV.*? , @SUBJ.*?main_FMAINV 
and:   SUBJ.*?FMAINV.*?because@CS.*?SUBJ.*?FMAINV 
are applicable, therefore the sentence is fully analysed as bearing a concessive clause in 
initial position and a reason clause in final position. 
The detailed description of syntactic patterns together with the annotation tags and 
lexical items used in the extraction process can be found in Appendix B.  
5.3.2.1 Adverbial Clauses 
I created syntactic patterns for 10 semantic subclauses, including, in some case, the 
specification of the position of the subclause with respect to the main clause (initial, 
final or incidental). In other cases, I created patterns for special construction, like the 
instructional patterns for time clauses. The list of the subclauses included in this version 
of the facets is in Table 11.  
1. concession clause (initial, final, special 6. reason clause (initial, final) 
2. conditional clause (initial, final, special) 7. result clause 
3. contrast clause 8. similarity manner comparison clause 
4. exception clause 9. space clause (initial, final) 
5. purpose clause 10. time clause (initial, final, incidental, 
instructional) 
 
Table 11. Adverbial clauses 
5.3.2.2 Complement/Nominal Clauses 
Complement clauses are a type of dependent clause used to complete the meaning of an 
associated verb or adjective in the sentence. They are also called nominal clauses 
because they occupy a noun phrase slot. There are four major structural types of 
complement clause: that-clause, wh-clause, to-infinitive clause, ing-clause (Biber et al., 
Chapter 5 - The Facets 
 80
1999: 658). The list of the complement clauses included in this version of the facets is 
in Table 12. 
1. verb+that clause 6. adjective+to clause 
2. adjective+that clause 7. verb+ing clause 
3. that omission 8. comparative clause 
4. wh-clause 9. relative clause 
5. verb+to clause  
 
Table 12. Complement clauses 
5.3.2.3 Simple Sentences 
In his text grammar for English, Werlich lists six phenomenon sentences (Werlich, 
1976: 216 ff.). Phenomenon sentences are simple sentences (i.e. without any 
subordinates) that specify the relation of a text producer with the spatio-temporal 
context. More specifically, according to Werlich’s cognitive framework, all sentences in 
the communication process interact with contextual factors of the spatio-temporal 
environment. Against this referential context, all sentences are phenomenon sentences 
because the text producer emphasizes a type of phenomenon in the spatio-temporal 
context. According to Werlich, when the frequency of one of these sentences is very 
high in a single text, the text is likely to belong to one of the five text types described in 
his text grammar. As noted earlier, Werlich's terminology does not belong to the 
English tradition, so it can appear unfamiliar. The list of simple sentences included in 
this version of the facets is in Table 13: 
1. phenomenon registering 4. phenomenon linking 
2. action recording 5. quality attributing 
3. phenomenon identifying 6. action demanding

5.3.3 Evaluation of Linguistic Facets 
Labelling Accuracy of Syntactic Patterns 
As mentioned earlier, there are no corpora available in English with syntactic annotation 
at sentence or clause level. Therefore, the accuracy of automatic labelling (Step 5 
Chapter 5 - The Facets 
 81
above) cannot be measured against any reference corpus. In order to get a rough idea of 
how well the automatic labelling performs, the syntactic patterns of five subclauses 
(time, manner, purpose, concession, and reason) created with examples taken from 
Quirk et al. (1985) were tested against 34 sentences containing the same subclauses 
taken from Biber et al. (1999). 
Figure 4 shows a snippet of the output of the labelling algorithm, and is useful to 
highlight some problems connected to a thorough evaluation of this approach.  
The output shows different kinds of information. For instance, Sentence 1 was copied 
from Biber et al. (1999) (called LGSWE in the output) on page 818, from examples 
provided for time adverbials. This information was enriched with the addition of the 
position of the subclause with respect to the main clause, and the subordinator 
employed (<!-- : ****** time_clause_initial_when ****** -->). Sentence 1 is 
automatically labelled as time_clause_initial and verb_to_clause, both labels are 
correct. One limitation with the use of grammars for evaluation purposes is that it 
allows the evaluation of only one label per sentence, because the emphasis in grammars 
is mostly on a single linguistic phenomenon at time. Therefore, the label verb_to_clause 
(expects to recover) cannot be objectively evaluated. 
Sentence 2 receives only the label complex NP (good thoughts) because the pattern 
with until followed by be is not available yet. Sentence 3 is labelled correctly as 
time_clause_initial, and finally Sentence 4 does not receive any label, because, as 
mentioned before, as is a highly ambiguous subordinator, which has not been 
thoroughly disambiguated yet. 
Three categories were used to give an idea of the quality of the automatic labelling: 
C(orrect), I(ncorrect), NAY (not available yet). Out of 34 sentences, 21 were labelled 
correctly, 2 received incorrect labels, and for 11 sentences the patterns were not yet 
available. In terms of percentage this means: 61.7% correct; 5.8% incorrect; 32.3% 
NAY. If I consider that the patterns for these subclauses were built using only a limited 
number of examples from Quirk et al. (1985), these results show a promising potential. 
Chapter 5 - The Facets 
 82
Presumably, adding new patterns from different grammars will extend the coverage of 
the automatic labelling. 
Errors with Connexor were detected mostly with special constructions, such as the 
concessive clause: Fool that he was he managed to evade his pursuers. The 
parse of this sentence is shown in Table 14.

As shown in Table 14, the adjective fool is parsed as an imperative. I mentioned already 
that patterns are not built from examples parsed incorrectly. The impact of errors 
performed by the parser will be clear only when a comprehensive benchmark is devised 
to evaluate the automatic labelling of subordinate clauses. 
Preliminary Evaluation of Syntactic Patterns as Genre-Revealing Features 
In order to test the efficiency of syntactic patterns as genre-revealing features, I built 
two datasets for three web genres: BLOGS, FAQS, and FRONTPAGES (200 documents per 
web genre, cf. Appendix A). The first dataset was built with normalized frequency 
counts of syntactic patterns listed in Table 15. 
1. adjective_that_clause relative_clause 
2. adjective_to_clause result_clause 
3. comparative_clause similar._man_comp_cl. 
4. complex_np space_clause_final 
5. concession_clause_final space_clause_initial 
6. concession_clause_initial that_omission 
7. concession_clause_special time_clause_final 
8. conditional_clause_final time_clause_incident. 
9. conditional_clause_initial time_clause_initial 
10. conditional_clause_special time_clause_instruc. 
11. contrast_clause verb_ing_clause 
12. exception_clause verb_that_clause 
13. purpose_clause verb_to_clause 
14. reason_clause_final wh_clause 
15. reason_clause_initial  
 
Table 15. Syntactic patterns used for a preliminary evaluation 
The second dataset was built with normalized frequency counts of the subordinators 
listed in Table 16.  
The learning algorithm used for this task was an SVM classifier as implemented in 
Weka (Witten and Frank, 2005; cf. also Section 10.3.3). A 10-fold cross-validation was 
run 10 times with different seeds, and accuracy results were averaged. The dataset 
containing 29 syntactic patterns returned an averaged accuracy of 86.2%, while the 
dataset with the 42 subordinators reached an averaged accuracy of 83.6%. Syntactic 
Chapter 5 - The Facets 
 84
patterns perform better than subordinators and the gap of 2.6% in the accuracy is 
statistically significant (chi-square test of significance). Presumably, with a better 
coverage of syntactic patterns the classification accuracy can increase even more.

Evaluation of Linguistic Facets as a Whole: Linguistic facets vs. POS trigrams 
In order to test the efficiency of the all linguistic facets as genre-revealing features, I 
built two datasets for four web genres: BLOGS, FAQS, FRONT PAGES, and PERSONAL 
HOME PAGES (see Appendix A). I then built two SVM models. One model was built 
using 211 POS trigrams38 and the other one with 84 linguistic facets. The 84 linguistic 
facets comprised 27 functional cues, 13 connectives, 29 subordinate patterns, 9 simple 
sentence patterns (I added 3 variants to the patterns presented in subsection 5.3.2.3), and 
                                                 
38 As pointed out in Chapter 4, there are several ways of selecting POS trigrams. In the present case, I 
firstly computed POS trigrams for each web genre, and deleted those POS trigrams with a frequency less 
than 200 (each web genre was represented by 200 web pages, so in the most optimistic hypothesis a POS 
trigram was present at least once in each of the web pages). I then collected all the POS trigrams for all 
the four web genres into a single file, and sorted them into a list ignoring their frequencies of occurrence 
in the single web genres. Finally, I deleted all the POS trigrams that appeared more than twice in this list. 
The rationale behind this choice is that in order to be discriminating, a POS trigram must not be present in 
all web genres, and I decided on a threshold of two out of four web genres. I ended up with 211 POS 
trigrams.  
Chapter 5 - The Facets 
 85
6 subordinators not fully disambiguated with syntactic patterns (namely if, as, while, 
whereas, when, and since). 
Linguistic facets are mainly based on syntactic annotation, and POS trigrams represent a 
shallow approach to syntax. Both of them have a syntactic nature so they can be 
compared consistently. I ran the classifiers ten times with ten different seeds and 
averaged the accuracy results. 211 POS trigrams returned an average accuracy of 
86.50%, while linguistic facets returned an average accuracy of 84.28%. The difference 
is statistically significant (chi-square test of significance). 
According to these findings, linguistic facets perform reasonably well, even though their 
accuracy is lower than the set of POS trigrams. It is to be noted, however, that the 
number of POS trigrams is definitely higher than the number of facets (211 vs. 84). 
Presumably, increasing the number of linguistic facets may have a positive impact on 
accuracy results.  
5.3.4 Other Facets 
I also created another facet, i.e. the genre-specific-word facet. The genre-specific-word 
facet collects genre-specific referential vocabulary together with a number of words 
relating to the function of a web page. Examples of genre-specific referential 
vocabulary are words like ‘home page’ or ‘corner’ that I can find in expressions 
common in PERSONAL HOME PAGES, like: 
“Welcome to my personal home page”  
“Thank you for stopping by my personal home page”,  
“This page is my personal corner” 
 
Examples of words relating to the function of a web genre like ESHOP are words like 
‘buy’, ‘order’, ‘purchase’ etc. connected to the function of ‘selling’. An example of a 
genre-specific-word facet is shown in Figure 24. 
Chapter 5 - The Facets 
 86
 
 
Figure 24. An example of genre-specific-word facet 
The rationale behind the creation of such a facet is based on the intuition that it is likely 
that the name of the genre is mentioned in the document where the genre is instantiated, 
because the use of meta-discourse is a common linguistic device in written genres (cf. 
Swales and Feak, 2000: 34 and passim). A similar motivation underpins the inclusion of 
words relating to the function of a genre. Intuitively, if the function of a genre is to 
answer questions, like in the FAQS genre, it is likely that words such as ‘question’ and 
‘answer’ are present in the documents that instantiate this genre.  
The detailed list of genre-specific word facets together with the lexical items used in the 
extraction process can be found in Appendix B.  
5.4 HTML Facets 
HTML facets are built relying on the same assumption as linguistic facets. However, 
instead of containing linguistic material, they use other cues, namely HTML tags. In 
other words, HTML facets contain groups of HTML tags interpreted functionally.  
The use of HTML tags is not new in automatic genre classification (e.g. cf. Meyer zu 
Eissen and Stein, 2004). However, HTML tags have always been accounted for 
individually, and never collected into interpreted macro-features, similar to the HTML 
facets that I present here. An example of HTML facets – the functionality facet – is 
shown in Figure 25. The functionality facet collects all the tags related scripts, email, 
input files, and so on. In a few words, it denotes the user active interaction with the 
information contained in a web page. 
Chapter 5 - The Facets 
 87
I designed six HTML facets to highlight the following textual aspects: layout, 
typography, interactivity, and navigability. Navigability has three aspects: general 
(including internal and external links), external, and internal. This latter subdivision 
was inspired by a previous study showing that there might be differences in the use of 
links in different types of web pages. For example, as shown by the findings of the 
project TypWEB (Beaudouin et al., 2001a, 2001b), personal websites contain fewer 
external links than commercial websites. This might be true also for specific individual 
web pages, and not only for complete websites.  
The detailed description of HTML facets together with the HTML tags used in the 
extraction process can be found in Appendix B.  
 
 
Figure 25. Example of a HTML facet: the functionality facet 
5.5 Conclusion 
In this chapter I described the facets, i.e. functionally-interpreted automatically-
extractable features that highlight different aspects of communication. The set of facets 
suggested in this chapter is only an initial set that can be easily enlarged and enhanced 
in future. 
Facets can be fed, like any any other genre-revealing features, into standard supervised 
algorithms with profitable results, as shown in the preliminary evaluation reported in 
this chapter. Additionally, they have further potential. For example, the different 
Chapter 5 - The Facets 
 88
communication aspects highlighted by the facets can be assembled and composed 
together to infer text types by integrating the observations made by Werlich and Biber.  
Both the functional interpretation encoded in the facets and their good potential as 
standard genre-revealing features will be exploited in the experiments described in 
Chapters 10 and 11.  
In the next chapter I will summarize the range of genre-revealing features that will be 
employed in the experiments presented in the coming chapters.

Chapter 6.  Assembling Feature Sets for 
Automatic Genre Identification 
This chapter closes Part II, the part dedicated to features. Together with POS trigrams 
(Chapter 4) and facets (Chapter 5), other features, coming from previous studies, will 
also be used in this research. This chapter summarizes and discusses their properties and 
ends by listing the types of features that will be used in the experiments presented in the 
next parts of the thesis. 
6.1 Introduction 
As pointed out in Chapter 1, features have a crucial impact on any automatic 
classification approach, but unfortunately automatically-extractable features represent a 
scanty substitute for potentially useful genre-revealing features that could be detected 
by a human analyst. In fact, many features are not ready yet for an automatic extraction, 
for instance those relating to discourse organization or compositional plan. Also 
interactive selection and extraction, similar to those applied by Biber (1988) for present 
and past participial clauses (Biber, 1988: 233), are not appropriate for a fully automated 
approach to text type or genre identification. Consequently, the number of 
automatically-extractable genre-revealing features is limited. For this reason, in the 
previous chapters I proposed expanding the range of existing genre-revealing features 
by including POS trigrams (Chapter 4) and facets (Chapter 5). In this chapter, I would 
like to list the features that have been used in previous automatic genre classification 
studies and discuss them. I will include some of these features in the experiments 
described in the following chapters. 
There are some properties of automatically-extractable features that are desirable in 
automatic genre identification, namely genre representativeness, discriminating power 
Chapter 6 - Assembling Feature Sets for Automatic Genre Identification 
 90
and exportability. Starting with the first two, we can say that a set of features well 
represents a genre when it can discriminate that genre against other genres. Conversely, 
when a genre is not well represented by the features, i.e. the features do not capture the 
core traits of a genre, the discrimination power of the features is low, and this affects the 
accuracy of automatic genre classification. In general, it is more difficult to find 
discriminating features for similar genres, such as TUTORIAL vs. HOW-TOS39, or for 
related subgenres, such as PERSONAL HOME PAGE vs. CORPORATE HOME PAGE vs. 
ORGANIZATIONAL HOME PAGE
40. This also means that the composition of a genre palette 
affects the accuracy of automatic genre classification (cf. also Chapter 2). 
Another important aspect concerns the exportability, or transferability, of features. 
Features can be very representative for a corpus but not representative when exported to 
another corpus with a different genre palette. The possibility of using a feature set 
without much adaptation to another genre palette represents an added value in terms of 
time saving. The exportability of a feature set has thus to do with the attribute of 
generality, a desirable attribute of all automatic systems. 
In the next section I will briefly review different types of features employed in previous 
studies, and make some remarks on them with respect to these three properties. 
6.2 Properties of Automatically-Extractable Genre-
Revealing Features 
6.2.1 Genre Representativeness and Discriminating Power 
Very few studies focus on the comparison of different kinds of automatically-
extractable genre-revealing features. To my knowledge, only four studies on automatic 
                                                 
39 A current project by Elisabeth S. Boese is centred on this very issue: Classification of similar genres. A 
reference to this project is in Boese and Howe (2005a). 
40 Cf. experiments in Kennedy and Shepherd (2005).

genre classification concentrate on feature comparison, namely Wolters and Kirsten 
(1999), Dewdney et al. (2001), Lim et al. (2005a), and Finn and Kushmerick (2006). 
Wolters and Kirsten (1999) investigate to what extent POS frequencies and content 
words are useful for both domain and genre classification on a German corpus. 
Unfortunately, their results are inconclusive.  
More informative are the findings reported by Dewdney et al. (2001). These authors 
show that topic-independent features, which they call “presentation features” (see also 
Section 2.4), are genre-revealing. Presentation features include both linguistic and 
layout features. Their efficiency is compared with that of content words, that they call 
“word features”, collected with a BOW approach (see footnote 25 in Chapter 2) across 
three different classifiers (Naive Bayes, C4.5 and SVM) on the Carnegie Mellon 
University (CMU) genre corpus. According to their results, the use of presentation 
features aided by some selected content words is the most promising for genre 
classification.  
Another a comparison between POS tags and content words is provided by Finn and 
Kushmerick (2006)41, who define genres in terms of two polarities: subjective vs. 
objective, and positive vs. negative. They discriminate among texts from different 
domains according to these two polarities using three feature sets: content words 
collected with a BOW approach, POS frequencies, and text statistics (i.e. ratios like 
average word length). Their aim is to investigate how a classification model tuned on 
one domain performs in another domain. One of the most interesting results shows that 
a model built with C4.5 trained on football and tested on politics has an accuracy of 
about 58% when using a BOW approach, 74% when using POS frequencies, about 63% 
when using text statistics, and about 72% when using MVE42. From these findings, it 
appears that POS frequencies can be profitably exported into another domain and 
                                                 
41 Finn and Kushmerick (2006) encompass experiments or findings reported in Finn et al. (2001, 2002) 
and Finn and Kushmerick (2003). 
42 MVE refers to the Multi-View Ensemble learning approach, which builds a model based on each of the 
three feature sets. A new instance is classified on the basis of a majority vote. 
Chapter 6 - Assembling Feature Sets for Automatic Genre Identification

achieve a good performance when discriminating between “subjective” and “objective” 
documents. 
More geared to web documents is the experience reported in Lim et al. (2005a). The 
authors state “web documents are different from textual documents, in that they contain 
URL and HTML tags within the pages”. The use of information coming from URL 
and/or HTML is not new (e.g. cf. Meyer zu Eissen and Stein, 2004), however the merit 
of Lim et al. (2005a) is that they explicitly assess their impact on genre classification. 
More generally, they test the efficiency of five types of features on a corpus of 16 
genres43 that can be found on the web, measuring feature performance on different parts 
of a web page44 using TiMBL (see footnote 31 in Chapter 4). Results show that “the 
best combination of features comprises URLs, HTML tags, token information, mostly 
used function words, most frequently used punctuation marks and syntactic chunks”, 
applied to the individual web page as a whole, with a performance of 74.3% on 16 
genres. When they apply an automatic feature selection method, the accuracy of the best 
combination can be improved up to 75.7%. In their conclusion, they explicity state that 
punctuation marks, function words, URLs and HTML tags are the appropriate features 
for automatic genre classification of web documents. 
In sum, from the findings on feature behaviour reported in this section, it appears that 
topic-independent features – like punctuation marks, function words, POS frequencies, 
and HTML tags – tend to better represent genres in a classification framework and, 
consequently, they show more discriminating power than topic-dependent features, like 
the content words extracted with a BOW approach. This tendency is also confirmed by 
the performance of the two topic-independent genre-revealing features that I suggested 
in the previous chapters, namely POS trigrams (Chapter 4) and facets (Chapter 5). 
                                                 
43 They expand the genre palette suggested by Dewe et al. (1998). 
44 More specifically: (1) title and meta-content, (2) anchor text, and (3) body text in four combinations 
(see Lim et al., 2005b).

6.2.2 Exportability of Genre-Revealing Features 
Topic-independent, corpus-independent exportable features 
POS frequencies, function words, punctuation marks, ratios, HTML tags, and facets are 
topic-independent. In other words, their distribution is not linked to the 
subject/content/topic of a document. These features are also corpus-independent. That 
is, they can be directly exported to other corpora with differing genre palettes, without 
any adaptation. I will include these types of features in my experiments. 
Topic-independent, corpus-dependent non-exportable features 
POS trigrams are topic-independent, but corpus-dependent features. This means that 
they can be exported only to corpora with the same genre palette as the corpus they have 
been computed upon. Additionally, setting the threshold for discriminating POS 
trigrams is an empirical and tentative technique, and can cause overfitting. As 
highlighted in Chapter 4, POS tags are also linguistically opaque and do not provide any 
intuitive textual insight. Despite these disadvantages, they showed a very good 
performance in genre discrimination (Chapter 4). For this reason I will include them in 
my experiments. 
Content-dependent non-exportable features 
Content words selected using a BOW approach are corpus-dependent, and more 
appropriate to detect topic rather than genre. Generally speaking, genre is mostly topic-
independent, apart from special cases, where some topics tend to be dealt with the same 
genre (e.g. OBITUARIES), or when genres bear their specialization in their name, such as 
BIOGRAPHY or WEATHER REPORT. However, as already noted, most genres (e.g. REPORT, 
EDITORIAL, INTERVIEW, FAQS, and TUTORIAL) are not linked to any topic (cf. Section 
2.1.1). Therefore, it is rather intuitive that, when not dealing with special cases, content 
words cannot capture genre-related differences. Nonetheless, some recent experiments 
in automatic genre classification include content words in their feature sets, for example 
Boese (2005). In this respect, useful remarks come from Dewdney et al. (2001). As 
described above, Dewdney et al. (2001) compare the efficiency of content words with 
topic-independent features (“presentation features”) and acknowledge that:  
Chapter 6 - Assembling Feature Sets for Automatic Genre Identification 
 94
“The use of presentation feature set yields a significant advantage over use of word 
frequencies, except when using Naive Bayes. This shows that presentation features alone, 
when used with a suitable classifier, are pertinent to classifying genre without the need for 
word features often used”.  
And again in the conclusion:  
“Rather than presentation features aiding discrimination by words it seems selected word 
features assist discrimination by presentation features [...]”. 
That content words are not ideal features for automatic genre classification is confirmed 
also by some conclusive remarks in Lee and Myaeng (2002): 
“Analysing the results in detail, we realized that some genre classes are significantly 
confusing to the classifier because they tend to share some subject-specific terms using the 
deviation formula [i.e. the formula that they propose, my comment]. We probably need to 
explore other ways to obtain the same effect. In addition, we need to consider other more 
linguistically oriented features and expressions in our future study so that the mutually 
confusing genre classes are separated more easily.” Lee and Myaeng (2002) 
As content words do not appear to be the most appropriate type of feature for genre 
identification, I will not include them in my experiments.  
6.3 Features Used in this Thesis 
As shown in the previous sections, genre-revealing features can have different degrees 
of genre representativeness, discrimination power and exportability. In the experiments 
described in the next chapters, I will use several types of features, namely: 
• Most common function words, listed in Appendix C.  
• 24 POS tags listed in Appendix C.  
• POS trigrams, described in Chapter 4. 
• Facets, described in Chapter 5 and listed in Appendix C.  
• Lexical subordinators, as listed in Chapter 5. 
• 28 HTML tags, listed in Appendix C.  
• A nominal attribute representing the web page length. More specifically, a web page containing 
< 150 words is considered to be SHORT; a web page containing < 500 words is considered to be 
MEDIUM; and finally a web page containing ≥ 500 words is considered to be LONG45.  
• 8 punctuation symbols: full stop (.), colon (:), semi-colon (;), comma (,), exclamation mark (!), 
question mark (?), apostrophe ('), and quotes ("). 
 
                                                 
45 The attributes SHORT, MEDIUM, and LONG are based on my personal observation that certain web 
genres show recurrent web page length. For example, SEARCH PAGES (like Google or Altavista) tend to be 
short, while BLOGS tend to be long.

The exact composition of the feature sets will be specified in each experimental setting. 
6.4 Conclusion 
In this chapter I summarized different types of automatically-extractable genre-
revealing features. I also briefly discussed some desirable properties that automatically-
extractable genre-revealing features should have, namely genre representativeness, 
discriminating power and exportability. It appears that many topic-independent features 
– like punctuation marks, function words, POS frequencies, and HTML tags – tend to 
better represent genres in a classification framework and, consequently, they show more 
discriminating power than topic-dependent features, like the content words extracted 
with a BOW approach. This tendency is confirmed also by the performance of the two 
new topic-independent genre-revealing features that I proposed in the previous two 
chapters, namely POS trigrams and facets. Additionally, topic-independent features are 
more exportable across different corpora with differing genre palettes. 
In the next parts (Part III and Part IV), I will describe experiments that rely on the 
features listed in this chapter.

Chapter 7.  Looking for Emerging Genres 
This chapter opens Part III, the part that justifies the necessity for a flexible genre 
classification scheme, i.e. a scheme capable of assigning zero, one or multiple genre 
labels to a web page. This chapter focuses on emerging genres. The concept of 
emerging genres is useful because it accounts for difficult or unclassifiable web pages. 
Ideally, emerging genres should receive no label or multiple labels. No label would 
indicate that the emerging pattern has no clear relation with existing genres, while 
multiple labels would suggest that the new pattern is hybrid. 
7.1 Introduction 
The goal of the set of experiments presented in this chapter is to investigate to what 
extent it is possible to detect and to classify emerging genres.  
As discussed in Chapter 1, emerging genres represent a transitional phase in genre 
evolution. They can be considered an effect of the fast pace of the web. They are 
embryonic patterns, not fully standardized, and without a name. Arguably, the concept 
of emerging genre is important because it captures the transitional phase that currently 
characterizes so many web pages, i.e. those web pages that cannot be sorted into any 
acknowledged genre.  
Emerging genres can be considered as hypothesised genres. We cannot predict exactly 
when and whether they will coalesce into acknowledged genres, because the emergence 
of a new genre depends on social acceptance. However, although we can confirm and 
disconfirm these hypotheses only in future, some quantitative cues may indicate that a 
new genre is in formation.  
Computationally, we might suspect an emerging genre when there is a recurrent textual 
pattern that does not comply with established genre conventions. More specifically, 
Chapter 7 - Looking for Emerging Genres 
 98
emerging genres either have no clear relations with existing genres, or they are hybrid, 
showing traits from several genres. 
In the experiments described in this chapter, I will investigate (a) whether emerging 
genres can be detected automatically, and (b) if they can be classified in any way. 
The automatic identification of emerging genres has some practical benefits, as pointed 
out in Chapter 1. First, it can help organize the large number of unclassified or 
unclassifiable pages populating the web. Second, the identification of genres in 
formation might be especially useful for genre-based search engines, where the 
foresight provided by the detection of emerging textual patterns can result in a prompt 
update of genre-based systems, which would then be ready to host novel genres as they 
emerge. 
7.2 Experiments 
In this section I present two experiments. Both experiments are based on the same web 
page collection – the SPIRIT collection (for a description, see Appendix A) – and the 
same statistical algorithm – cluster analysis – but they differ for number of web pages, 
and type and number of features.  
The detection of emerging genres on the web cannot be easily done by hand, because 
humans have difficulties in handling large amounts of data. Clustering algorithms, on 
the other hand, can help identify similarities concealed behind differing traits. 
Cluster analysis is a standard algorithm that can be found in many statistical packages. 
It has the potential to reveal structures within the data by grouping homogeneous 
objects together on the basis of similarity measures (several measures are available in 
any standard implementation). It can be used in an exploratory or confirmatory way. In 
these experiments, the aim is exploratory. 
The clustering algorithm chosen for the experiments is K-means, as implemented in the 
statistical software SPSS. K-means is suitable for large datasets, easy to understand, and 
very fast. It performs the following steps: 
Chapter 7 - Looking for Emerging Genres 
99 
• Pick up a number of cluster centers. 
• Assign every item to its nearest cluster center. 
• Move each cluster center to the mean of its assigned items. 
• Repeat until convergence occurs. 
• Reassign the objects if they are closer to another cluster than the original assigned. 
 
Although simple and fast, K-means has two main problems relating to (a) the number of 
clusters and (b) the set of initial seeds. These two elements are important because the 
number of the clusters must be specified in advance and is not suggested by the 
algorithm, and the quality and reliability of the final cluster solution heavily depends on 
the initial seeds. 
Unfortunately, there is not just a single answer to these issues, as pointed out by 
Anderberg (1973). In the experiments presented in this chapter, the number of clusters 
was eventually decided measuring the distance between clusters, and the distance within 
clusters. The preferred solution had the maximum distance between clusters and the 
minimum distance within each single cluster. Arguably, this approach ensures the 
highest distinctiveness and the highest compactness of a cluster solution. 
As for the number of seeds, after many attempts with random seeds, selected seeds, and 
seeds suggested from Hierachical Cluster Analysis, a final decision was made for 
random seeds, also supported by Peña et al. (1999). Random seed selection is also the 
default in SPSS, which uses a parallel threshold, selects several cluster seeds 
simultaneously, and assign objects within the threshold distance to the nearest seed.  
Whatever the number of clusters and the selection of initial seeds, it is important to 
highlight, however, that the success of exploratory clustering is measured subjectively 
in terms of how useful the results appear to the analyst.

7.2.1 Experiment 1 
The experimental question underlying the first experiment is the following: 
Premise 1: in a random sample of the web extracted from the SPIRIT collection,  
Premise 2: using cluster analysis, which is claimed to have the potential to reveal 
structures within the data,  
Premise 3: leveraging on sets of features successfully used in other genre studies, 
Question: is it possible to detect patterns that could suggest the formation of emerging 
genres? 
 
In this experiment I relied on the following linguistic features (for a description of these 
features, see Chapter 6): 
• 50 most frequent words in English; 
• 31 POS tag frequencies; 
• 100 POS trigram frequencies46; 
• 57 HTML tag frequencies. 
 
The methodology included the following steps: 
• Extraction of five samples of 200 English web pages each (1,000 web pages in total) 
from the SPIRIT collection;  
• Extraction and frequency counts of 238 features (see the bulleted list above); 
• Feature reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA); 
• Cluster analysis over the components resulting from PCA; 
• Qualitative analysis of the clusters returned by cluster analysis; 
• Comparison of the clusters across the different samples. 
 
Outliers47 were considered to be representatives of subpopulations, and left in the 
samples. PCA was run in order to address the problem of multicollinarity (cf. Hair et al., 
1998). Variables that are multicollinear (i.e. those showing some degree of correlation 
                                                 
46 The selection of this set of POS trigrams was carried out following the method decribed in footnote 38, 
Chapter 5. 
47 An outlier is an observation that lies at an abnormal distance from other values in a random sample 
from a population. 
Chapter 7 - Looking for Emerging Genres 
101 
among them) are implicitly weighted more heavily: multicollinearity acts as a weighting 
process that affects the results. The components returned by PCA are not supposed to be 
correlated. All the components resulting from PCA were used for cluster analysis. 
In order to determine the appropriate number of clusters, K-means was run several times 
on the datasets, specifying each time a different number of clusters, from 6 to 12. The 
choice of this range was tentative. As indicated earlier, the preferred solution had the 
maximum distance between clusters and the minimum distance within each single 
cluster. 
In this first experiment, cluster analysis was repeated on five samples of 200 web pages 
to see whether the nature of the main clusters was consistent among the different 
samples. 
7.2.1.1 Results 
As mentioned earlier, the assessment of the cluster resulting from an exploratory 
investigation is usually measured subjectively. In my analysis of the clusters, I picked 
up web pages nearest to the cluster centroids48. Intuitively, web pages that are very close 
to a cluster centroid are the most representative for that cluster.  
Some regularities emerged from the qualitative analysis of the clusters. More 
specifically, I could identify four main rhetorical/discourse patterns across the five 
samples. These patterns were: INFORMATIONAL, INSTRUCTIONAL, ARGUMENTATIVE, and, 
to a smaller extent, NARRATIVE.  
INFORMATIONAL web pages showed regular traits, such as 3rd person point of view, and a 
detached and non-emphatic tone. Apparently, their aim was to provide an objective and 
impersonal explanation or description. ABOUT PAGES, NEWS RELEASES, or BOOK 
REVIEWS were some of the genres that showed these traits.  
                                                 
48 A centroid represents the mean of a cluster. 
Chapter 7 - Looking for Emerging Genres 
 102
In ARGUMENTATIVE web pages, the structure of the ARGUMENTATION was often 
implemented through rhetorical questions, the use of the 1st person pronouns, 2nd person 
pronouns to address and involve the reader in a direct way, etc. The writer’s intention to 
convince the reader was evident. A large variety of genres are used for this purpose, 
such as SERMONS, EDITORIALS, and ANSWERS TO LETTERS.  
The INSTRUCTIONAL type includes genres like GUIDELINES, SUGGESTIONS, 
RECOMMENDATIONS, and FAQS. There was a proliferation of 2nd person pronouns, 
should, deontic future, and similar linguistic features.  
NARRATIVE texts were present to a lower extent in the samples. I found NARRATION in 
genres such as MEETING MINUTES and NEWS REPORTS.  
This text profiling appeared to be cross-genre, similar to the much more articulated 
analysis described in Biber (1988). 
However, some noise was also returned. For example, some clusters could be divided 
into two subgroups, i.e. a single cluster included at the same time web pages with 
continuous text – the majority – and web pages with little continuous text, that I 
assessed to be noise because they were a minority in the cluster. I could not find 
plausible explanations for this phenomenon.  
7.2.1.2 Validation 
In order to validate my analysis of the rhetorical/discourse types perceived in the 
clusters, I set up a small study with web users.  
Five PhD students and a researcher in Computational Linguistics were chosen as 
subjects and given six web pages (shown in Appendix E) from my samples. I selected 
only six texts because I was looking for a thoughtful answer without burdening the 
subjects.  
Two tests were set up. In Test 1, the subjects were given the six web pages in random 
order and were instructed to group them according to their type by hand. No training 
was provided. Subjects were neither given examples nor a list of possible labels. They 
Chapter 7 - Looking for Emerging Genres 
103 
were only told to ignore the topic, i.e. their groupings could be based on any criteria 
except the topic. They were allowed to create at least two but fewer than six groups. The 
subjects were then asked to assign a label (existing or invented) to each of their groups. 
In Test 2, the subjects received the same web pages, but this time they were asked to 
group them according to three labels: ARGUMENTATIVE, INFORMATIONAL, 
OTHER. Table 17 reports my personal classification of the six web pages for Test 1 and 
Test 2:

 104
From the results reported in these tables, it appears that when the subjects could choose 
freely their non-topical labels, there was a wide range of variation (Table 18 and Table 
19). However, some of the categories suggested could be seen as belonging to the same 
family. For example, SERMONS, DEBATES, CONTROVERSIES, COMMENTARIES, and 
EDITORIALS have all common rhetorical/discourse traits, because in all of them there is 
an argument being supported. This seems to confirm the idea that a predominant 
rhetorical/discourse strategy is enacted within different, but related genres, as intuited 
by Werlich (1976).  
Some degree of consistency came out also for the labels suggested for less traditional 
texts, for example web page 2 and web page 5 in Appendix E: 
SPRT_010_049_112_0055878 is mostly related to searching, and SPRT_025_058_105_0052155 
to selling.  
When the subjects were asked to choose among the restricted number of labels 
suggested for Test 2, their choices were extremely consistent. Their classification is 
shown in Table 20 (arg=argumentative; inf=informational; oth=other):

Table 20. Classification of the 6 subjects for Test 2 
There is almost unanimous agreement in classifying the web pages; only Subject 5 used 
the label INFORMATIONAL for web page 2 and web page 5 in Appendix E, while all 
other subjects classified them as OTHER. In order to assess the degree of agreement 
beyond any random chance, I computed the K statistic as an inter-rater measure 
(Carletta, 1996), and the value returned was 0.85, indicating a very good level of 
agreement among the subjects. 
Chapter 7 - Looking for Emerging Genres 
105 
In sum, this user study suggests that the rhetorical/discourse properties of a text are 
recognized and applied consistently by the web users when their label is hinted; when 
no indications are given, except the restriction of not using the topic as a category, a 
wide range of different labels is used, some of them showing a degree of consistency 
from a rhetorical/discourse point of view.  
7.2.1.3 Discussion 
Even if cluster analysis did not return any evident textual patterns that could suggest 
emerging genres, I found out that the traditional rhetorical/discourse types were 
extensively used on the web. Consequently, regardless of all the technical uncertainties 
related to cluster analysis, regardless of some noise in the clusters, consistent 
rhetorical/discourse profiles could be identified. These profiles were easily recognized 
by web users in a small sample of six web pages singled out from the larger samples 
used in the experiments. Probably the needs to inform, describe, instruct, convince, or 
narrate are universal (as suggested also by Faigley and Meyer, 1983), and discourse 
types expressing these needs are easily produced on any media and recognized by the 
audience.  
Another question is about features. Possibly, the features used in this experiment were 
too ‘shallow’ – since they mostly rely on morphological information – to identify 
patterns that may lie at a deeper level of the textual structure. There was probably a 
relation between the use of shallow features and the noise returned.  
In order to investigate more about this issue, in the next subsection I will describe a 
similar experiment that relies, this time, on syntactic features. 
7.2.2 Experiment 2 
Experiment 2 assumes the same experimental question as Experiment 1, but it relies on 
syntactic features instead of morphological information, and applies a different 
validation of the clusters. 
Chapter 7 - Looking for Emerging Genres 
 106
Two sets of features are used in Experiment 2: one including syntactic patterns (cf. 
Chapter 5), the other including connectives and subordinators. I will refer to the first set 
as sy_pat, and to the second set as con_sub. 
The sy_pat set includes the following features (see Chapter 5, Appendix B and 
Appendix C for a breakdown): 
• 28 functional cues  
• 29 syntactic patterns  
• 33 HTML tags 
 
The set con_sub contains the following features (see Chapter 5, Appendix B and 
Appendix C for a breakdown): 
• 28 functional cues  
• 52 connectives and subordinators  
• 33 HTML tags 
 
The methodology includes the following steps performed on the whole sample of 1,000 
random English web pages from the SPIRIT collection (the same 1,000 used in the 
previous experiments, but this time collected in a single collection and not in 5 smaller 
samples): 
• Parsing of the text-only version of the web pages. 
• Extraction and frequency counts of the two sets of features. 
• Normalization of the frequencies by the number of words in a web page. 
• Transformation of the frequencies into z-scores. 
• Selection of the best cluster solutions, one for each set of features. 
• Measure of the overlap between the two best cluster solutions. 
• Qualitative analysis of the overlapping areas between the two best cluster solutions. 
 
Z-scores represent the number of standard deviations a score is above or below the 
mean. They represent the deviation from a ‘norm’, and here they have been used as a 
way of weighing the features with respect to an ideal mean.  
In order to determine the appropriate number of clusters, K-means was run several times 
on the dataset, specifying each time a different number of clusters, from 5 to 15. The 
choice of this range was simply empirical, as in the previous experiment, but was meant 
Chapter 7 - Looking for Emerging Genres 
107 
to include the five most common text types (NARRATION, DESCRIPTION, INSTRUCTION, 
ARGUMENTATION, and EXPLANATION) up to a maximum of 15 genres. For each cluster 
solution, the distance between clusters and the distance within each cluster have been 
calculated in the two sets of features. As in the previous experiment, the preferred 
solutions had the maximum distance between clusters and the minimum distance within 
each single cluster. A 15-cluster solution was suggested for both sets of features. The 
distribution of the web pages across the clusters of the two solutions is shown in Figure 
26. 
 
Figure 26. Con_sub cluster solution on the LHS, and sy_pat cluster solution on the RHS 
These two cluster solutions were compared using a method commonly used in 
document clustering, i.e. comparison by pairs. First, all the possible unique 
combinations of pairs of the 1,000 documents were computed (499,500 pairs). Then an 
algorithm was built to answer the two following questions: “does the pair get classified 
as “same” or “different” by the sy_pat cluster solution” and “does the pair get classified 
as same or different by the con_sub cluster solution”? Then the overlap between the two 
classifications was computed using a two-by-two contingency table (Table 21). 
 
Table 21. Contingency table of pairwise agreement 
Chapter 7 - Looking for Emerging Genres 
 108
There are several coefficients that can measure the overlap between two different 
classifications. I used the simple matching coefficient (Oakes, 1998: 113), which 
returned a value of 0.61 (0.0=no overlap, 1.0=perfect overlap). This value indicates an 
overlap of above 60% and an acceptable degree of stability of the clusters returned by 
the two sets of features. 
For the qualitative analysis, I selected web pages that were the nearest to the cluster 
centroids (intuitively, the most representative), and overlapping across the two 
solutions. 
7.2.2.1 Results and Discussion 
In this section, I first comment on minority clusters, then on majority clusters. Minority 
clusters are those clusters containing a limited number of web pages, as the ones 
showed in Table 22. Majority clusters, on the other hand, contain a large number of web 
pages. 
Minority clusters 
There is almost a perfect distributional overlap between the minority clusters shown in 
Table 22.

Chapter 7 - Looking for Emerging Genres 
109 
In order to validate my assessment, I asked a web user to manually cluster these 24 web 
pages. No criteria were suggested apart from the request of not using topic as a 
clustering criterion. The web user ended up with three clusters. Since variation in 
clustering is normal (cf. Macskassy et al., 1998), I asked the user to assign six labels 
corresponding to the six genres that I could surmise from my qualitative analysis, 
namely SERVER MESSAGE, TELEPHONE DIRECTORY, BIBLIOGRAPHIC REFERENCES, 
GLOSSARY, TABULAR INFORMATION, and SUMMARY LIST). I compared the user’s 
classification with my classification, and assessed the degree of agreement with the K 
statistic. The value returned was above 0.90, indicating a very good level of agreement.  
These clusters represent easily recognizable web genres. However, it seems that human 
clustering when carried out without any strict guideline tends to be less analytical than 
the automatic clustering. 
Majority clusters 
As for majority clusters, web pages in the con_sub cluster 6 (368 cases) fall almost 
entirely (more than 98%) into the sy_pat cluster 1 (Figure 27). This is a sign of stability. 
This cluster includes web pages with highly laid-out information, little text, often a 
centered (hot)list, a photograph with personal details, such as address, phone, email, etc. 
They could be seen as contact web pages. 
 
Figure 27. Majority cluster 1 
Chapter 7 - Looking for Emerging Genres 
 110
Web pages in the con_sub cluster 2 (39 cases) mainly fall into the sy_pat cluster 1 
(72%) (Figure 28). These pages all share a highly laid-out textual organization, with a 
large number of hyperlinks, short schematic information, block language, many images. 
It seems they share the common purpose of conveying relevant information quickly and 
exhaustively, leaving to the user the decision whether to display more details by 
following the hyperlinks. This textual pattern applies across genres. A DVD e-shop, 
headlines, an art gallery shop, and an animation website are some of the types that were 
gathered together. The web pages grouped in this cluster focus on a fast-effective 
information delivery. 
 
Figure 28. Majority cluster 2 
The con_sub cluster 1 (508 cases) is spread across the following sy_pat clusters: cluster 
1 (35%), cluster 3 (35%) and cluster 9 (25%) (Figure 29). This large cluster is more 
heterogeneous and many of its web pages look like ‘containers’, because they include 
several functions.  
Chapter 7 - Looking for Emerging Genres 
111 
 
Figure 29. Majority cluster 3 
Without going into any further details, I would like to draw some conclusions.  
Six con_sub clusters (Table 22) show extremely well-defined textual profiles, 
corresponding to recognized genres: SERVER MESSAGE, TELEPHONE DIRECTORY, 
BIBLIOGRAPHIC REFERENCES, GLOSSARY, TABULAR INFORMATION and SUMMARY LIST.  
The con_sub cluster 2 appears to be an emerging textual pattern. It bears a set of 
coherent traits, which can be seen as a new combination of traditional block language 
(largely used in the press) with high use of hyperlinks. This combination enables the 
delivery of information customized to the user needs: first a glance at the most 
important information (either prices and short product description, or titles and the first 
lines of the articles, and so on), then the possibility of following the navigational links 
leading to further details. It will be interesting to see whether such a textual pattern (still 
loose) will develop into a proper web genre label in the near future.  
In con_sub cluster 6 the optimisation in delivering information seems to be more 
restricted to contact or personal details. The navigational opportunities are less extended 
than in the previous cluster. This textual pattern too could become more standardized in 
a short time.  
Chapter 7 - Looking for Emerging Genres 
 112
The con_sub cluster 1, on the other hand, shows a kind of mixed textuality; it appears to 
still be highly heterogeneous. The cluster is too big to have one single profile. Many of 
its web pages look like ‘containers’ showing different communicative purposes and 
different degrees of formality and spontaneity.  
In sum, although vagueness and elusiveness are common conditions before a novel 
textual pattern becomes formally and functionally established (Görlach, 2004: 108), a 
couple of emerging textual patterns could be identified. I named these patterns as 
follows: contact web pages and fast-effective information delivery. From a textual point 
of view, they have a good chance of becoming new web genres, but their actual 
emergence relies on social acceptance.  
An important aspect remains unspecified with cluster analysis: the relation of these 
patterns with existing and acknowledged genres. Although textual patterns might show 
a high degree of novelty, it is also plausible that they would show some similarities with 
existing genres. With cluster analysis this kinship remains unspecified. 
In conclusion, feature sets containing syntactic features appear to be more effective than 
feature sets based on morphological information with cluster analysis. More 
importantly, findings show that some consistent textual patterns can be detected, but the 
relation of these patterns with existing genres is not revealed.  
7.3 Conclusion 
The experiments described in this chapter showed that it is possible to automatically 
identify textual patterns. These patterns may be interpreted as emerging genres, i.e. 
genres that currently cannot be sorted into any existing genres, but they might develop 
more stable genre conventions in future. 
 However, no real classification was possible. Even if clusters were validated, the 
interpretation of the patterns that represent emerging genres remains subjective. 
Additionally, the relations of these patterns with existing and acknowledged genres 
remain unspecified. The detection of these relations could be a way of classifying 
Chapter 7 - Looking for Emerging Genres 
113 
emerging genres with respect to existing categories. As suggested earlier, emerging 
genres should receive no label or multiple labels. No label would indicate that the 
emerging patterns has no clear relation with existing genres, while multiple labels 
would suggest that the new pattern is hybrid, i.e. it draws from several existing genres. 
However, a completely unsupervised method, like cluster analysis, cannot suggest any 
label. 
In the next chapter, I will tackle the problem of genre labelling from another point of 
view, i.e. the lack of agreement in assigning genre labels to web pages among web 
users.

Chapter 8.  Zero, Single, or Multi? Genres of 
Web Pages through the Users’ Perspective 
This chapter continues along the same line as the previous chapter, but focuses on genre 
labelling and classification from another point of view, namely the users’ perspective. 
More precisely, this chapter describes a web user study that shows that a single genre 
classification does not correspond to web users’ view of web pages. 
8.1 Introduction 
The goal of the study presented in this chapter is to investigate the extent to which web 
users agree on assigning a single genre label to a web page. The extent of agreement on 
a single genre can help understand if there is a need for a flexible genre classification 
scheme that overrides the single-label assumption.  
The difficulty of assigning a single genre to web pages is well expressed by Rosso 
(2005), when he reports the comments of the participants to his studies: 
“In summary, the comments provided much insight into participants’ experiences of single-
genre webpage categorization: problem with pages fitting multiple categories, problems 
with pages fitting no categories, and general recognition of the characteristic formal 
elements of many of the web pages.” (Rosso, 2005: 116) 
 
This difficulty has been pointed out also by other scholars and researchers who carried 
out surveys about the genre of web pages, namely, Dewe et al. (1998), Haas and Grams 
(1998), Shepherd and Watters (1999), Crowston and Williams (2000), Roussinov et al. 
(2001), and Meyer zu Eissen and Stein (2004). All of them have hinted at the difficulty 
of fitting a web page into a single-genre classification scheme for different reasons: 
either the page is multi-genre, or without any genre; either genre conventions are 
unclear, or genre taxonomy is fuzzy; and so forth. However, these authors do not 
Chapter 8 - Zero, Single, or Multi? Genre of Web Pages through the Users’ Perspective 
 115
address the problem of the agreement on a single genre label for a web page. This is, 
instead, the focus of the investigation reported in the following sections. 
8.2 Assigning a Single Genre to a Web Page 
In this section, I first describe a small-scale preliminary study. Then, I go on to report 
on a larger-scale web user study where 135 subjects are involved. 
8.2.1 Preliminary Study 
Assigning a genre label to a web page is not always as straightforward as one might 
think. As a preliminary step, I tried to manually assign a genre label to a random sample 
of 200 English web pages, extracted from the SPIRIT collection (see Appendix A). In 
this preliminary study, I did not follow any genre taxonomy or criteria. As is evident 
from the outcome reported in Table 23, results show a diversified picture. 
More specifically, for 25 pages I could not find a label at all (see item 21 in Table 23, I 
don’t know); for 15 pages I could say only that they were ‘mixed’; the rest of the labels 
shift from genre labels (e.g., BIOGRAPHY, MINUTES, POEMS, FAQS, COMMENTS, or NEWS 
REPORTS), to rhetorical/discourse labels (e.g. EXHORTATIVE, INSTRUCTIONAL, or 
DESCRIPTIVE-INFORMATIONAL), to labels that account for the layout structure (e.g. tables 
or lists). 
This small-scale experiment shows some of the difficulties that a web user may face 
when naming a web page by genre. For instance, when a genre of a web page is not 
obvious, and the use of the topic as classification criterion is not allowed, the tendency 
is to use the discourse characteristics of the main body of the page (e.g. EXHORTATIVE). 
When neither genre nor rhetorical types are evident, the tendency is to look at 
typographical structure of the text, like the tabular structure.

Table 23. My manual classification of 200 random web pages 
As this small-scale survey was too biased towards my own personal impressions, I 
decided to change the experimental strategy by involving a large number of participants 
in order to get a more objective view on the perception of web users with respect to the 
genre of web pages. 
8.2.2 Users’ Perspective on the Genre of Web Pages 
This study provides some insight into the users’ perspective on the genre of web pages. 
The users’ perspective is expressed by the assignment of a single (genre) label to a web 
page. I put the term ‘genre’ into brackets because the full set of labels employed in the 
study includes 21 web genre labels plus two ‘escape’ labels, namely the ‘Add a label’ 
and ‘I don’t know’ options.  
Chapter 8 - Zero, Single, or Multi? Genre of Web Pages through the Users’ Perspective 
 117
The difficulty of assigning a single label to a web page is measured using the principle 
of ‘user warrant’. According to the standard ANSI/NISO50 Z39.19-2005 (NISO, 2005): 
“User warrant is generally reflected by the use of terms [my emphasis] in requests for 
information on the concept or from searches on the term by users of an information storage 
and retrieval system”. (Z39.19-2005, NISO, 2005) 
 
User warrant is one of the standards used by multi-lingual countries to develop their 
vocabularies. For example, it is included in the Guide to the Development and 
Maintenance of Controlled Vocabularies in the Government of Canada51, supported by 
the Treasury Board Secretariat of Canada (TBS), where it is defined as follows:  
“ ‘User warrant’ refers to a justification for selecting terms based on words or phrases 
employed by users [my emphasis] of information resources for information retrieval or 
information management. Evidence of such usage may be derived from search engine logs 
or interviews. User warrant ensures that the language of the vocabulary matches the 
language of the user community”. (Guide to the Development and Maintenance of 
Controlled Vocabularies in the Government of Canada) 
 
More related to my study is the application of the principle of user warrant as proposed 
in Rosso (2005: 104):  
“if the majority of the participants agree that a web page is of a particular genre, then it is”. 
(Rosso, 2005: 104) 
Building on Rosso’s user warrant interpretation, I extended this principle to adapt it to 
the purpose of my study in the following way: 
SINGLE GENRE: when the agreement of many users on a single genre label is high, 
then the web page is not difficult to classify into a single genre, i.e. a single-genre 
classification can be profitable. This applies also to a case when the majority of web 
                                                 
50 “NISO, the National Information Standards Organization, a non-profit association accredited by the 
American National Standards Institute (ANSI), identifies, develops, maintains, and publishes technical 
standards to manage information in our changing and ever-more digital environment. NISO standards 
apply both traditional and new technologies to the full range of information-related needs, including 
retrieval, re-purposing, storage, metadata, and preservation.” see

Chapter 8 - Zero, Single, or Multi? Genre of Web Pages through the Users’ Perspective 
 118
users use the ‘Add a label’ option to add new, but consistent, genre labels for the same 
web page. 
• MULTIPLE GENRES: when the agreement of users on the genre of a web page is 
fragmented across a number of genre labels, then the web page is difficult to sort 
into a single genre, i.e. a multi-genre classification can be profitable. 
• NO GENRE: when a large part of agreement aggregates around the two ‘escape’ 
options, ‘Add a label’ and ‘I don’t know’, then the web page cannot be easily 
sorted into any genre, i.e. a zero-genre classification can be more appropriate. 
Population: the Academic Environment 
Asking a web user to classify a web page by genre is not a easy task because genre 
identification requires a level of abstraction which is often linked to a number of 
different factors, such as the society in which the subjects live (in a society without 
computer-mediated communications, web genres would make no sense), 
cultural/educational level (without a certain degree of education, an academic home 
page cannot be identified or perceived as belonging to a (sub)genre), and the 
membership in a community (being a ‘blogger’ makes it easier to identify a BLOG or a 
CLOG). In this study, I assumed that the level of abstraction needed to perceive web 
genres could be found in an academic environment where high education, free access to 
computer-mediated communication and familiarity with the web are the norm.  
Giving priority to the level of education and to internet literacy, I left details about age, 
gender, profession and more personal or demographic information as optional additions, 
and I will not include them in the discussion of the results.  
Figure 30 shows the welcome page of the study. Only Surname and First Name were set 
as required fields, but participants were told that they could use pseudonyms/nicknames. 
These two fields were used to build unique identifiers for each of the subject (a 
sequential number was added in order to avoid homonyms). Later on, all the names 
were eliminated and replaced with serial numbers to ensure confidentiality.

The academic population on which the study is built upon has three elements in 
common: 
1) it is a medium-high educated population (from administrative staff to students and 
professors);  
2) it is very used to computer-meditated communication; 
3) it is very familiar with the web.

Study Design 
As mentioned earlier, the study relies on the users’ perspective of the genre of web 
pages. The users’ perspective is expressed by labelling a web page using one label. The 
idea behind such an approach is to exploit the different levels of agreement on the 
genres of web pages to assess the difficulty of classifying a web page by a single genre. 
For instance, as explained earlier, if many users agree mostly on a single genre label 
when they see a web page, then the web page is not difficult to classify into a single 
genre. By contrast, when the agreement of users on the genre of a web page is 
fragmented across a number of genre labels, then the web page is difficult to sort into a 
single genre. 
The web genres included in the study are 21. These 21 web genres are briefly described 
in Appendix D.  
Chapter 8 - Zero, Single, or Multi? Genre of Web Pages through the Users’ Perspective 
 120
The screenshots of the 25 web pages used in this study, and the original URLs are 
shown in Appendix F in sequential order. These web pages are also available online as 
bitmap files at <http://www.nltg.brighton.ac.uk/home/Marina.Santini/>. 
I collected from the web 21 web pages that could represent the 21 genre labels. Ideally, 
each web page represents a single genre or a predominant genre. In other words, each of 
these web pages is a stereotypical exemplar of a web genre.  
For the association one web genre/one web page I used a criterion that I will explain 
more extensively in Chapter 10, i.e. the criterion of ‘objective sources’. In brief, I 
selected these ‘representative’ web pages in either of the following ways: 
 The web pages showed the name of the genre in the title. For example, FAQS was 
in the title of webpage_12, and HOTLIST was in the title of webpage_15 (but 
cf. the experimental choices on pages 125-127);  
 The web page was downloaded from genre-specific portals or archives. For 
example, webpage_01 representing an ESHOP was downloaded through 
<http://www. shops.co.uk>;  
 The genre was included in the URL. For example, webpage_10 representing the 
ABOUT PAGE was downloaded from <http://infogistics.com/about.html>.  
The web pages included in the study were downloaded in early 2005. 
In the set of web pages, I also included three web pages from the SPIRIT collection (see 
Appendix A), not bearing any official genre (see webpage_18, webpage_21, and 
webpage_23 in Appendix F), and a common web page type, without any official 
genre name, downloaded from the live web (see webpage_17 in Appendix F). I 
assigned nicknames to these four web pages to facilitate any reference to them during 
the discussion of the results. These nicknames are the following: 
• webpage_17=RYANAIR;  
• webpage_18=ADIRONDACK;  
Chapter 8 - Zero, Single, or Multi? Genre of Web Pages through the Users’ Perspective 
 121
• webpage_21=CITIDEX; 
• webpage_23=LENS HOLDER. 
 
In summary, the total number of web pages included in the study is 25: 21 web pages 
were selected having a web genre in mind, and four web pages did not explicitly 
represent any specific genre.  
Table 24 lists the web genres included in the study, and the web page representing that 
genre.

Participants’ Task and Sample Size 
The study was web-based. It was uploaded on to the ITRI server (University of 
Brighton, UK) at the end of February 2005, and kept online for one month up to the end 
of March 2005.  
The study is based on participants who volunteered within the University of Brighton, 
the Informatics Department of University of Sussex (UK), a Department of Dalhousie 
University (Canada), a Department of Syracuse University (USA), plus other academics 
in other universities and research institutes in Europe. Potential participants were sent 
an email, and this email was re-distributed within the academic environment. 
The participants’ task was straightforward. Users were asked to go though 25 web pages 
and label each page by selecting a radio button. There were 23 labels available for 
selection, i.e. 21 genre labels and the two ‘escape’ labels, ‘I don’t know’ and ‘Add a 
label’ (see Figure 31). Subjects appreciated the possibility of adding their own label52 
and the possibility of stating that they did not know how to label a web page.  
Figure 31 shows the structure of the pages presented to the participants accessing the 
website of the study. Figure 32 shows how a web page was presented to the user. The 
general structure includes a space for the picture of the web page in the upper box, 21 
radio buttons with genre labels in the bottom box on the left-hand side (LHS), and two 
‘escape’ buttons (‘I don’t know’ and ‘Add a label’) plus a text box for optional 
comments in the bottom box on the right-hand side (RHS). Most participants did not 
comment on the arrangement of the study. However, some suggested a different layout 
of the screen53, and others complained about it54. 
As it was not possible to move to the next page without selecting a radio button, 
participants who completed the test assigned a label to each of the 25 web pages. No 
                                                 
52 Subjects’ comment: “Nice that you can add your own categories”. 
53 Subjects’ comments: “Perhaps one suggestion would be to show the options of the radio button at the 
very beginning”. 
54 Subjects’ comments: “The way the types of webpages are listed is not very user friendly”. 
Chapter 8 - Zero, Single, or Multi? Genre of Web Pages through the Users’ Perspective 
 123
restriction was given on the selection of labels, i.e. users could use the same label for 
more than one web page, or never employ a label if deemed inappropriate. 
Participants could add additional personal details in the welcome page (Figure 30) if 
they wished to do so (some of them asked to be sent the results of the study by email), 
and specify optional comments on each web page. In the last page of the study, where 
they were thanked, they could add additional comments. 
 
 
Figure 31. Structure of the selection page 
Chapter 8 - Zero, Single, or Multi? Genre of Web Pages through the Users’ Perspective 
 124
The web pages were presented to the subjects in the following random sequence: 
webpage_04, webpage_25, webpage_03, webpage_02, webpage_05, 
webpage_19, webpage_23, webpage_15, webpage_11, webpage_13, 
webpage_21, webpage_12, webpage_07, webpage_09, webpage_24, 
webpage_08, webpage_20, webpage_14, webpage_16, webpage_10, 
webpage_06, webpage_18, webpage_22, webpage_01, and webpage_17. 
198 users in total began the experiment. A number of them (27 users) did not write any 
name or nickname and a small portion (6 users) wrote only their first name, but this was 
not enough to let them continue because, as mentioned earlier, first name and surname 
were set as required fields; a larger part (30 users) dropped out at different level of the 
study; in the end, the total number of participants who went through the whole study 
and provided valid responses for the experiment amounted to 135 users. 
Among drops-out, 12 left at the welcome page, but wrote a full name; 7 left at the first 
or second page of the study; 7 left between the second page and the tenth page; 2 left at 
page 17; one left at page 14, and finally one left at page 16. Among possible hypotheses 
for dropping out, some are easy to identify: lack of interest in the study, tiredness (too 
many web pages to be assessed); or lack of familiarity with the suggested labels. Very 
few users started the study, left and resumed later on. Most of the participants went 
through the study without any break.

Figure 32. Example of the screen 
Experimental Choices and Limitations 
I made a number of experimental choices in this study. First, I included only one page 
per web genre to keep a reasonably short run time. I tried to include as many genre 
labels as possible (in order to have a broader view) that could be processed in no more 
than 15-30 minutes. Time limitation for a volunteering audience was the main reason 
for ‘offering’ only one web page per genre. Nonetheless, some of the subjects 
complained that the study was too long and they lost interest along the way55. 
Second, the term ‘genre’ was never mentioned in the study because I did not wish to 
trigger any reflections or afterthought about this term. I preferred having a 
labelling/classification that was as spontaneous as possible. The goal of the study was 
                                                 
55 Subjects’ comments: “Too long, I lost interest after about 18” (see drops-out section). 
Chapter 8 - Zero, Single, or Multi? Genre of Web Pages through the Users’ Perspective 
 126
not declared either. Participants were only told to select a label for each web page. The 
idea was to ask for a genre classification of web pages implicitly, and observe the users’ 
reactions. However, some subjects enquired about the goal of the study56.

56 Subjects’ comments: “Very interesting. What’s it all about?”; “Very interesting. I’d love to know the 
research question behind the study!”; somebody asked explicitly “What is the aim of the study?”. 
Chapter 8 - Zero, Single, or Multi? Genre of Web Pages through the Users’ Perspective 
 127
Third, when the genre was mentioned in the main heading of the original web page, I 
deleted the genre name. I thought that it would have been too easy to make a choice in 
the conditions shown in Figure 33, LHS. Therefore, users were presented the web page 
as shown in Figure 33, RHS. The only exception to this rule was the ABOUT PAGE, 
which was presented untouched, as shown in Figure 34.  
Fourth, I also arbitrarily decided the kind and number of genres to be included in the 
study. I used some of the web genres included in this study also for my experiments on 
automatic genre identification (see Chapters 10 and 11). One of the subjects complained 
that I did not include American genre names57. 
The main limitation of this study is graphical. Web pages were presented as screenshots 
(exactly as they appear in Appendix F). For this reason, certain genres suffer from the 
absence of context (e.g. the EMAIL genre, webpage_03). The lack of context was 
noted by the subjects who straightaway complained58. 
8.2.2.1 Results 
The counts discussed in the following subsections are mostly based on percentage59. I 
grouped results according to three ranges of agreement on the most voted label: an 
agreement above 80% is considered to be high; an agreement between 50% and 80% is 
considered to be medium; finally an agreement below 50% is considered to be low. I 
will show later whether these thresholds make any sense. 
 
                                                 
57 Subjects’ comments: “I noticed that some of the names were British. I recommend adding North 
American expressions alongside with them” 
58 Subjects’ comments: “You have cut headers and footers off some of the pages. These are the parts of 
the page which give a clear indication (often) about what kind of page/site it is”; “Hard to determine the 
type of page without context”. 
59  Recently, Rosso has suggested two interesting measures to assess users’ recognition of genre in web 
pages (Rosso, 2005: 109 ff.). The first is the users’ average agreement over the pages in which a 
consensus of 50% was achieved in a particular genre. The second measure provides an indication of 
“false hit” per genre. According to Rosso, these two measures together provide a more complete picture 
of the users’ recognition. However, their full interpretation and effectiveness are still under investigation. 
For this reason, I have not applied them yet in this study.

 128
Single-Label Agreement 
A view of the data of this study is offered in Table 25 (this table is reproduced in larger 
print in Appendix F). This table shows the number of subjects assigning a particular 
label to a particular web page and the percentage of the most voted label. For example,  
the label ESHOP (8th row) was assigned to WP160 (first column) by 119 subjects 
(highlighted cell), which corresponds to 88.15% (bottom row). Four subjects thought 
that WP1 was a CORPORATE HOME PAGE, seven selected NET AD, one subject chose 
FRONT PAGE, another subject selected HOTLIST, one DID NOT KNOW, two added a new 
label for it. Results reported in this table are statistically significant, as shown by the 
values of Chi-square and Fisher’s Exact test shown in Figure 35.

Chapter 8 - Zero, Single, or Multi? Genre of Web Pages through the Users’ Perspective 
 129
 
Figure 35. Chi-square and Fisher’s Exact Text 
 
Using the three thresholds mentioned above, I could identify three ranges of agreement 
in the users’ perspective. Table 26 shows the percentage of agreement by range: Top 
(Above 80%), Middle (Between 50% and 80%), and Bottom (Below 50%). The records 
in the third column, Agreement on the labels of web pages, show the name of the page, 
the genre label that received the highest agreement, and the percentage of agreement. 
For example, webpage_02-personal_hp=88.89% means that webpage_02 (Figure 
36), was classified as a PERSONAL HOME PAGE by 88.89% of participants. According to 
the percentages shown in Table 26, participants show the highest agreement, namely 
above 80%, on the genre of five web pages: webpage_02 was classified as a 
PERSONAL HOME PAGE by 88.89% of the participants, webpage_01 as an ESHOP by 
88.15%, webpage_11 as CORPORATE HOME PAGE by 88.15%, webpage_12 as FAQS 
by 83.7%, and finally webpage_05 as a SEARCH PAGE by 82.96%. 
In the middle range (agreement between 50% and 80%) two cases are particularly 
interesting, webpage_10 and webpage_21. Webpage_10 was classified as a 
CORPORATE HOME PAGE by 94 web users (69.63%), only 32 participants (23.7%) 
labelled it as ABOUT PAGE. One of the four pages without any official name, namely 
webpage_21 (CITIDEX), was assessed as a SEARCH PAGE by 57.8% of participants. 
Chapter 8 - Zero, Single, or Multi? Genre of Web Pages through the Users’ Perspective 
 130
 
 
Figure 36. A web page representing the personal home page genre (webpage_02) 
The bottom range contains four interesting cases, namely webpage_17, 
webpage_18, webpage_23, and webpage_15. Webpage_17 (RYANAIR) and 
webpage_18 (ADIRONDACK) were two of the web pages without any official genre. 
Webpage_17 was classified as ONLINE FORM by 42.22% of participants, and 
webpage_18 ORGANIZATIONAL HOME PAGE by 38.52%. Although these web pages are 
not stereotypical exemplars of a web genre, a majority of users (a thin majority, indeed) 
could perceive some genre conventions in them. More problematic is another of the web 
pages without an official genre, i.e. webpage_23, for which the majority of users (a 
majority of only 26.7%) agreed in adding a new label for it. Interestingly, most of the 
added labels61 are consistent and all roughly indicate some kind of ‘product information 
page’. However, more than 10% preferred to select ‘I don’t know’. Similarly, 
webpage_15 shows a majority of 23.7% of users who preferred to add a label62. 
                                                 
61 Added labels for webpage_23: content page, information page, online product information, product 
catalogue, product documentation, product information, product manual, product specification page, sub 
page of an online store, tech specifications, technical description, technical documentation, technical 
information page, technical instructions, technical product description, and (normal) webpage (sic). 
62 Added labels for webpage_15: academic document, catalogue, classification page, contents page, 
database listing, encyclopaedia, expert information, index, index of links, index page, information page, 
itemization page, knowledge directory entry, link list/page, menu page, navigation page, online 
encyclopedia, online reference, online textbook, primary navigation tool, reference, select from list, 
(online) table of contents, and topic indices.

A first conclusion can be drawn from these results. A high agreement on a single label 
exists only on a restricted number of web pages, i.e. 20%  (i.e. 5 web pages out of 25). 
For the rest, 80% of the web pages, show different level of disagreement, in some case 
particularly acute, as in the case of webpage_23 and webpage_15. 
Figure 37 shows the charted percentages. The average of agreement on the top range is

Table 27. Pairwise agreement 
One problem with percentage analysis is that it fails to take account of agreement for 
categories other than the most popular, so a 60-10-10-10-10 split among five categories 
Chapter 8 - Zero, Single, or Multi? Genre of Web Pages through the Users’ Perspective 
 133
will look exactly the same as a 50-50 split among two categories. For this reason it is 
customary to look at pairwise agreement, i.e. the percentage of agreeing judgment pairs. 
For example, the 60-10-10-10-10 split has 60*59/2 + 4*10*9/2 = 1950 agreeing pairs 
(39.4%), whereas the 50-50 split has 2*50*49/2 = 2450 agreeing pairs (49.5%), so the 
latter has higher agreement overall.  
The pairwise agreement on the individual web pages is shown in Table 27. It mostly 
corresponds to percentages shown in Table 26, except for the very few cases highlighted 
in Table 27. 
In conclusion, the agreement appears to be stable on a single label only in the top range.  
Beyond the Single Label 
In the previous section, I showed the agreement on the most voted label. A single-label 
agreement is reasonably stable on only five web pages out of 20. In many cases, (20 
web pages out of 25) agreement on a single label is either moderate (middle range) or 
low (bottom range).  
 In this section, I show another view on the data based on the distribution of agreement 
across several labels. It is worth saying that participants in this user study explicitly 
complained about the limitation of the labelling task to a single-label63. However, one of 
the very aims of the study is to investigate the effects of a restriction of classification of 
a web page on a single-genre label.  
Table 28 shows a breakdown of the raw counts (bold font) and percentages (normal 
font) of the five web pages where users reached an agreement of above 80%. The main 
aggregation of agreement is around the first label (Column Name: 1st). However, three 
web pages (WP2, WP1, and WP5) also show that some users preferred other labels 
                                                 
63 Some comments from participants: “A page can be a search page and almost anything else, right?”; 
“Topologies based on single descriptors are grossly inadequate for interactive website”; “Some pages 
could belong to multiple types”; “Many of the pages have characteristics of more than one of the types 
listed”; “I don't think, the types you listed are mutually exclusive.  For example an online shop page can 
be an online form. That made it rather difficult to answer anything other than Don't Know”. 
Chapter 8 - Zero, Single, or Multi? Genre of Web Pages through the Users’ Perspective 
 134
(Column Name: 2nd). In the representation of the agreement on different labels I 
applied a threshold in order not to clutter the table with too much data. More 
specifically, I included in the table only labels that received at least six preferences, that 
is 4.4% of agreement. A threshold of 4.4% approximately corresponds to the chance of 
randomly assigning one of the 23 labels to a web page [(1:23)*100]. For this reason, I 
did not include a second label for W11 and W12 because none of the voted labels 
reached a quorum of six votes (cf. Table 25). 
The situation appears much more fragmented in Table 29 and Table 30 (these tables are 
reproduces in larger print in Appendix F). Each web page in these tables has been 
assigned to at least three labels. The main difference between Table 29 and Table 30 is 
that in Table 29 the gap between the first label and the next label is wider than in Table 
30. The average gap between the 1st label and the 2nd label in Table 29 is about 43%, 
while it decreases to about 15% in Table 30. In other words, in Table 30 the agreement 
is more evenly spread over several labels.  
 
 
Table 28. Top range agreement 
Chapter 8 - Zero, Single, or Multi? Genre of Web Pages through the Users’ Perspective 
 135
 
 
Table 29. Middle range agreement 
In Table 30, two cases are particularly fragmented, i.e. WP23 and WP15. These two 
web pages were very difficult to classify according to the participants’ behaviour. Most 
users preferred to add their own label, a fair number of users declared that they did not 
know the most suitable label for these two web pages, and the rest of votes are spread 
over a large number of labels. By adding up the percentages of the two ‘escape’ options, 
I get a percentage of 37.04% for webpage_23 and of 28.89% for webpage_15. 
In conclusion, all web pages except two (namely, WP11 and WP12) have received more 
than one label. The aggregation of agreement around a single label is stable only for the 
five pages of the top range. The rest of web pages shows aggregation of agreement 
around at least three labels.

Table 30. Bottom range agreement 
8.2.2.2 Discussion 
From the data shown in the previous subsections, it appears that only a small number of 
web pages would unproblematically fit into a single genre, namely the five web pages 
showed in Table 28. Most of the web pages included in the study would benefit from a 
multi-label classification, because users perceive them from different angles. A couple 
of web pages (webpage_23 and webpage_15) do not seem to fit satisfactorily into 
any of the 21 web genres proposed in the study. In this case a zero-genre classification 
would seem more appropriate. 
I included in the study both stereotypical exemplars (21 web pages) and web pages 
without any official genre (four web pages). From the results, most stereotypical and 
less standardized web pages received at least three labels. This means that, broadly 
speaking, a multi-genre classification would be beneficial for many web pages. 
Chapter 8 - Zero, Single, or Multi? Genre of Web Pages through the Users’ Perspective 
 137
Probably when the fragmentation across many labels is very large (say more than 4 or 5 
labels), it may be more appropriate to assign a zero-genre label, thus signalling the 
uncertainty of the genre assignment. 
The thresholds and the percentage ranges (above 80%, between 50% and 80%, and 
below 50%) are informative. Web pages with an agreement of above 80% aggregate 
most votes at most on two labels (Table 28). Web pages with an agreement between 
50% and 80% aggregate votes on at least three labels, but the gap between the first label 
and the other labels is quite wide (Table 29). Web pages with an agreement below 50% 
aggregate votes on at least three labels, but the distribution of votes is spread much 
more evenly across the labels (Table 30). 
This interpretation of the results is only one of the possible views of the data collected 
in this study. In future, this data can be exploited to produce further findings. For 
example, they would be useful in investigating the following issues: 
• web genre granularity: to what extent can participants distinguish among different 
types of HOME PAGES, such as personal, academic, corporate, or organizational? 
• web genre exposure: to what extent are participants familiar with recent labels, such 
as CLOG or EZINE? Are they able to assign them to the appropriate web pages? Or are 
these labels still very opaque to them? 
• web genre clairvoyance: are participants able to suggest labels for complex or 
hybrid web pages? 
• unpopularity of web genre label: why are SPLASH SCREEN and HOT LIST such 
unpopular choices?  
• relations among genres: what is the relation among genres? Table 29 and Table 30 
help identify genres that users see as similar or related. For example, labels such as 
HOW-TO and TUTORIAL are often used interchangeably.

8.3 Conclusion 
In this chapter I described a study where 20 out of 25 web pages were labelled using at 
least three genre labels. This finding justifies the need for a more flexible classification 
scheme, capable of handling multi-genre labelling or zero-genre labelling. In particular, 
a zero-genre label could be used when there is a large disagreement on genre labels, and 
would signal the uncertainty of the genre assignment.  
In the next chapter, I will present two textual phenomena – genre hybridism and 
individualisation – that further motivate the need for a zero-to-multi-genre classification 
scheme.

Chapter 9 - Genre Hybridism and Individualisation 
 139
 
Chapter 9.  Genre Hybridism and 
Individualisation 
This chapter closes Part III by suggesting a characterization of genres of web pages that 
includes the two attributes of genre hybridism and individualisation. I argue that these 
two attributes are useful because they help pinpoint the range of flexibility that an 
automatic classification system for web pages should have.  
9.1 Introduction 
The aim of this chapter is to propose two attributes that might help characterize the 
genre of web pages more accurately. As discussed in Chapter 1, when dealing with 
genres of web pages, there are two important aspects to be taken into account. On the 
one hand, the web is a fluid, unstable and fast-paced. On the other hand, genres on the 
web are instantiated in web pages, which are a complex type of document, composite 
and multifarious. These two aspects are interwoven and often result in classification 
hurdles, as shown in Chapters 7 and 8.  
In this chapter, I suggest analysing these classification problems in terms of two broad 
textual phenomena: genre hybridism and individualisation. The identification of these 
two phenomena helps pinpoint the range of flexibility that an automatic classification 
system of web pages should have. More precisely, genre hybridism accounts for multi-
genre variation within the individual web page, while individualisation refers to the 
absence of any recognized genre in a web page. 
The argument that a single genre classification scheme is inappropriate for genre 
classification of web pages has already been developed by scholars and researchers 
working with genre. In particular, it shares some similarities with the multi-facetted 
classification (see Chapter 2) re-proposed in different, but neighbouring, areas by 
Chapter 9 - Genre Hybridism and Individualisation 
 140
Kessler et al. (1997) in automatic genre classification of text documents, Tyrväinen and 
Päivärinta (1999) in document management, and Crowston and Kwasnik (2004) in 
information studies. The main difference between the multi-facetted classification and 
the zero-to-multi genre classification scheme is that the multi-facetted approach is a 
multi-dimensional approach that highlights different aspects in a document, not 
necessarily different genres. As explained in Chapter 2, Kessler et al. (1997), for 
instance, proposed three facets – brow, narrative, and genre – that relate respectively to 
the kind of language used in the text, the text typology and the genre itself. Such an 
approach returns three independent and unrelated classifications, where the 
classification by genre corresponds to the traditional single-genre labelling. By contrast, 
I would like to focus on genre identification proper, i.e. on the assignment of zero-, one- 
or multi-genre labels to a web page.  
In particular, in this chapter I would like to focus on the theoretical aspect of the 
attributes of genre hybridism and individualisation, and not on the practical 
implementation (which is the object of the next chapters), and discuss in more detail in 
which way they contribute to a better understanding of the genre of web pages. Before 
starting this discussion, in the next section I will summarise the arguments exposed in 
Chapters 1 and 2, and stress why it is important to have a flexible classification scheme 
when dealing with genres of web pages. 
9.2 Attributes of Genres of Web Pages 
As explained in Chapters 1 and 2, genres of web pages have distinctive traits that make 
them different from genres of other types of documents. Two important traits are the 
functionality attribute and the web’s root in hypertext. However, these two attributes do 
not fully account for the current stage of genres on the web. 
Although genre has always been a heterogeneous and fuzzy concept, when dealing with 
genres of web pages heterogeneity and fuzziness cannot be overlooked without risking 
misrepresentation or oversimplification. In Chapter 1, I suggested that the fluidity and 
Chapter 9 - Genre Hybridism and Individualisation 
 141
fast-paced dynamism of the web together with the complexity of web pages affect the 
genre system and genre repertoire on the web. More precisely: 
• As the web is a new and still developing communication medium, mechanisms of 
re-adjustments – such as the adaptation of existing genres to the new conditions and 
the creation of novel genres – are common on the web. These re-adjustments bring 
about a transitional phase where genre conventions are unclear, and web pages do 
not belong to any recognizable genre. 
• The mixture of several genres, coming from different traditions, in a single web 
page is an easy and fast operation.  
• The lack of any institutionalised control (like, for example, in an organizational 
intranet) can stimulate authorial creativity and individualisation.  
In order to account for: (a) unclear genre conventions, (b) genre mixture and (c) 
authorial creativity, I suggest including in any characterization of genres of web pages 
the two attributes of genre hybridism and individualisation, discussed in the next 
section. 
9.2.1 Genre Hybridism and Individualisation 
Broadly speaking, genres show sets of standardized or conventional characteristics that 
make them recognizable, and this identity raises specific expectations. Together with 
conventions and expectations, genres have many other traits. I would like to focus on 
three traits, namely hybridism, individualisation and evolution.  
Genres are not mutually exclusive and different genres can be merged into a single 
document, generating hybrid forms. Also, genres allow us a certain freedom of variation 
and consequently can be individualised. Finally, genre repertoires are dynamic, i.e. they 
change over time, thus triggering genre change and evolution. It is also important to 
note that before genre conventions become fully standardized, a genre does not have an 
official name. As already noted, a genre name becomes acknowledged when the genre 
itself has an active role and a communicative function in a community or society 
Chapter 9 - Genre Hybridism and Individualisation 
 142
(Swales, 1990: 54-57; Görlach, 2004: 9; Görlach, 2002). Before this acknowledgement, 
a genre shows hybrid or individualised forms, and indistinct functions.  
All these traits can be accounted for by the two attributes of genre hybridism and 
individualisation. 
Genre hybridism is broad term accounting for several phenomena. It has often been 
pointed out that genres are not discrete systems (e.g. Gledhill as cited in Chandler, 
1997). A number of genre combinations are possible and common. For example, a 
mixed genre, like the TRAGI-COMEDY, is a genre having its own blending aspects of two 
or more genres. Multi-genre documents are documents where two or more genres 
overlap creating a specific and more standardized genre, as in the case of ESHOPS, which 
are often also SEARCH PAGES, as noted also by Meyer zu Eissen and Stein (2004). Some 
genres are intrinsically mixed, such as the NEWSLETTER, which contains EDITORIALS, 
REPORTS, INTERVIEWS, and so on. An additional problem concerns the fuzziness of 
genre labels because, for example, the same document can be named NEWS BULLETIN or 
PRESS RELEASE, as noted by Roussinov et al. (2001) (cf. also the difficulties of 
developing a genre palette described in Rosso, 2005: 67 ff.). Hybrid genres abound and 
are very common in the mass media (as stressed by Fairclough, cited in Chandler, 
1997). In an open environment, such as the web, where many needs and communities 
meet, genre mixture appears to be more extended than in other media. For instance, 
Figure 38 shows a personal BLOG that includes a HOW-TO. The attribute of genre 
hybridism does not specify if this page is both a BLOG and a HOW-TO, or a HOW-TO 
within a BLOG or vice-versa, or half a BLOG and half a HOW-TO. The concept of genre 
hybridism, as intended in this thesis, simply helps pin down when a web page contains 
more than one genre, regardless how these genres relate to each other. The 
acknowledgement that a web page can be hybrid is important when dealing with 
automatic genre identification, because traditional single-label classification algorithms 
are usually confused by hybrid genre conventions. The model presented in Chapter 11 
correctly classifies this web page applying two genre labels (see Subsection 11.3.4.3.2). 
 
Chapter 9 - Genre Hybridism and Individualisation 
 143
 
 
 
Figure 38. A web page showing genre hybridism: a how-to nested in a personal blog 
Individualisation refers to the impact of authorial experimentation. Although there is a 
process of imitation that favours similarities (cf. Furuta and Marshall, 1996; Yates and 
Sumner, 1997; Askehave and Nielsen, 2004; Rehm, 2006), authors of web pages are 
virtually free to invent or propose any genre variation. It is so much so that many web 
pages cannot be classified into any genres (cf. Haas and Grams, 1998). For instance, a 
web page like the one shown in Figure 39 does not find much consensus on the genre 
label. According to the user study described in Chapter 8, this web page (webpage_23) 
has been classified as follows (see also Table 3, Chapter 8):  
• the majority of users (36) added their own labels, which ranged from ‘content page’ 
to ‘product manual’64; 
• a number of users (14) frankly declared that they did not know its genre. 
 
For the rest, it was classified as: 
                                                 
64 The complete list of labels added for the web page shown in Figure 39 includes: content page, 
information page, online product information, product catalogue, product documentation, product 
information, product manual, product specification page, sub page of an online store, tech specifications, 
technical description, technical documentation, technical information page, technical instructions, 
technical product description, and (normal) webpage (sic).

• ABOUT PAGE (28 users);

• CORPORATE HOME PAGE (5 users);  
• FAQS (3 users); 
• NET AD (3 users); 
• BLOG (1 user);  
• ONLINE FORM (1 user); 
• SEARCH PAGE (1 user).  
 
In other words, the concept of individualisation covers web pages like the page shown 
in Figure 39, where genre conventions are not clear, and the range of oscillation is large. 
I ascribe this oscillation to authorial creativity, because a web page creator is virtually 
free to publish any kind of text in any kind of format, while in the paper world 
constraints on genre conventions are stronger, as noted by Yates and Sumner (1997).  
 
 
Figure 39. A web page showing individualisation 
It is worth noting that the border between genre hybridism and individualisation 
remains fuzzy, because an author can use a mixture of existing genres, or employ 
Chapter 9 - Genre Hybridism and Individualisation 
 145
individualised and unprecedented solutions to create a personalized web page. If we use 
Bakhtin’s metaphor, genre conventions can be seen as the centripetal force that keeps 
stability in genre repertoire, while hybridism and individualisation are the centrifugal 
forces that de-stabilize the system (cf. Chapter 1). This struggle between “stasis” and 
“change” (Yates and Sumner, 1997) gives rise to an intermediate phase in genre 
evolution, the transitional phase of emerging genres, which show unclear genre 
conventions. Arguably, emerging genres, too, can be accounted for in terms of genre 
hybridism and individualisation.  
Unclear genre conventions of emerging genre, genre mixture (cf. Figure 38) and 
authorial creativity (cf. Figure 39) justify the need for broadening the characterization of 
genre. I propose the following broad theoretical characterization of genres of web 
pages: genres are named communication artefacts, linked to a society or community, 
characterized by conventions, raising expectations, showing hybridism or 
individualisation, and undergoing evolution. 
This characterization is flexible enough to encompass not only genres of web pages and 
other digital genres, but also paper genres, both literary and practical genres.  
In conclusion, the identification of the two attributes of genre hybridism and 
individualisation help characterize the genres of web pages more accurately, and has a 
practical purpose: genre hybridism accounts for multi-genre classification, and 
individualisation for no-genre assignment. 
9.3 Conclusion 
In this chapter, I proposed a characterization of genres of web pages that includes the 
two textual attributes of genre hybridism and individualisation. I explained that they are 
useful because they help describe more accurately how genre categories are instantiated 
in web pages. The web is a complex scenario where: 
• the mixture of several genres in a single web page is a fast operation;  
Chapter 9 - Genre Hybridism and Individualisation 
 146
• the lack of any institutionalised control can stimulate authorial creativity and 
individualisation; 
• the constant introduction of web technologies brings about the transitional phase of 
emerging genres, where genre conventions are unclear.  
The identification of the two attributes of genre hybridism and individualisation help 
understand how flexible a classification system for web pages should be: genre 
hybridism accounts for multi-genre classification, and individualisation for zero-genre 
classification. 
In the next part of the thesis (Part IV) I will investigate to what extent it is possible to 
implement a scheme that includes zero- and multi-genre classification, in addition to the 
traditional single-genre classification.

Chapter 10.  Supervised Single-Label Genre 
Classification 
Part IV of the thesis focuses on methods for automatic identification of zero, one, or 
multiple genres in web pages.  
The present chapter describes two experiments that investigate to what extent the 
standard supervised single-label classification is profitable for automatic identification 
of genres in web pages. The investigation focuses on three aspects: (a) corpus 
composition and genre palette, (b) representativeness and exportability of features, and 
(c) exportability of classification models. I will first overview these issues and propose 
temporary solutions for some of them. Then I will describe the experiments, which 
show how these issues lead to problems in genre classification. Finally, I will discuss 
the findings, and draw some conclusions about the appropriateness of standard 
supervised single-label classification for identifying genres in the open web.  
10.1 Introduction 
The goal of the experiments described in this chapter is to show some of the advantages 
and disadvantages of supervised single-label classification by genre. The rationale of the 
experiments is to understand whether this approach – the mainstream approach used so 
far in automatic genre classification studies – is adequate for identifying genres in the 
open web.  
As discussed in Chapter 1, two main factors influence the identification of genre in web 
pages: web page complexity, and the fluidity and fast-paced evolution of the web. With 
the experiments reported in this chapter, I would like to investigate to what extent 
supervised single-label classification is suitable to cope with a situation where the 
population is unknown, and where web pages might be hybrid, or individualised. Up to 
Chapter 10 - Supervised Single-Label Genre Classification 
 149
now, the supervised approach has been used only with document collections where the 
population was predictable, and where web pages where selected to represent a single 
genre. 
The investigation into supervised single-label classification by genre will focus on three 
aspects whose influence on the accuracy of results has not been sufficiently explored or 
discussed: 
• Corpus-related issues, namely corpus composition and genre palette (or, in other 
words, the selection of genres and web pages in a corpus); 
• Feature-related issues, namely representativeness and exportability of genre-
revealing features; 
• Model-related issue, namely exportability of classification models. 
 
 
The two experiments described in this chapter provide some insights into these issues 
and help delimit the scope of supervised single-label classification when applied to 
genre categories. 
The next section provides more details about these issues and suggests some provisional 
solutions. 
10.2 Issues  
As already noted, the lack of a genre-annotated reference corpus, or benchmark, hinders 
any comparison among automatic genre classification studies. As a result, the main 
tendency has always been to build one’s own collection according to subjective criteria 
for corpus composition, genre annotation, and genre granularity. This is especially true 
for genre studies based on collections of web pages. Although building a genre-
annotated benchmark of web pages is difficult and needs further discussion and research 
(Chapter 12), a few problems can be acknowledged, and some criteria can be discussed 
and agreed. Without such an agreement, it is hard to compare different approaches and 
evaluate progress. For instance, how is it possible to compare classification results 
presented in the studies listed in Table 31? Is the 92% accuracy achieved by Boese 
Chapter 10 - Supervised Single-Label Genre Classification 
 150
(2005) better than the 70% accuracy obtained by Meyer zu Eissen and Stein (2004)? 
Table 31 shows that the following elements differ: 
• Corpus size 
• Number of annotators 
• Number of genres 
• Genre categories 
• Number of web pages per genre 
 
What is more, no annotation criteria have been explicitly stated in these studies. Genre 
annotation has been based either on the common sense of a single rater, or on the 
agreement of few annotators.

Table 31. Recent studies in automatic genre identification in web pages 
 
As it is now, each study remains self-contained and comparisons are virtually 
impossible. 
In the following subsections I will highlight only a few obvious issues that affect 
automatic genre identification studies. There are other issues that I will not address in 
this thesis, such as the impact of overfitting (cf. Chapter 4).  
Chapter 10 - Supervised Single-Label Genre Classification 
 151
In the next subsection I will suggest two simple criteria that represent a temporary 
solution for two corpus-related issues, i.e. genre annotation and granularity. 
10.2.1 Corpus-Related Issues: Proposing Two Commonsense Criteria 
In the previous section, I recalled that in the absence of standard criteria for genre 
annotation, the selection of web pages that represent a genre is usually assessed 
subjectively by human annotators, who vary in number and qualification. It has been 
noted by Boese (2005: 53) that building a genre collection with a palette of very 
disparate genres, and choosing exemplars (i.e. stereotypical documents) to 
unambiguously represent these genres, positively affect genre classification. This means 
that the assessment of the accuracy results should also take into account the ‘nature’ of 
the genres, and how documents representing these genres are selected. While Boese and 
co-worker state that they wish to address the former issue by exploring to what extent it 
is possible to discriminate among similar genres (cf. Boese and Howe, 2005a), I suggest 
two shareable criteria for the latter issue, i.e. the selection of web pages representing a 
genre, or, broadly speaking, corpus composition and genre palette. I called these two 
criteria (i) annotation by objective sources and (ii) consistent genre granularity. 
Annotation by objective sources 
The criterion of annotation by objective sources exploits the socio-cultural aspect of the 
concept of genre. As pointed out in Chapter 9, genres have a function in a society, or a 
community, i.e. they have a social or public role that implies a number of conventions 
and raises predictable expectations. This means that the function of different genres is 
recognized and correctly used in communication. Leveraging on this public and 
collective acknowledgement it is possible to create a genre-annotated collection without 
involving human annotators. The key is to download documents from genre-specific 
archives or portals and use their membership in these containers as evidence of an 
automatic membership in a specific genre. For example, web pages representing the 
ESHOP genre can be randomly downloaded from the portal <http://www.shops.co.uk/> 
and considered to be ESHOPS without any further manual annotation or inter-rater 
agreement assessment. I include in the public acknowledgement also genres used as title 
Chapter 10 - Supervised Single-Label Genre Classification 
 152
of documents, for example, the HOTLIST genre can be represented by a document like 
‘Insects Hotlist’ shown in Figure 33, LHS. 
The idea behind selecting documents with a genre in the title or picking them up 
randomly from public resources, such as archives or portals, is the following: if there is 
an archive, a portal or a website specialized in, say, pointing to or collecting genres such 
as ESHOPS, BLOGS or SEARCH ENGINES, this means that the documents pointed to or 
collected there are considered to belong to these genres by the collectivity of web users. 
Although genre collections or portals might contain biases as well, these biases can be 
alleviated by randomly picking up web pages from several genre-specific web archives 
or portals.  
Arguably, a genre collection annotated by objective sources tends to be more 
representative for intra-genre variation and closer to real-world conditions than a 
collection annotated relying on the genre stereotypicality that two, three, or more 
annotators have in mind. Further, annotating a collection using objective sources is 
faster and less tedious. 
Consistent genre granularity 
A consistent genre granularity is also important when building a collection for genre 
classification. In fact, genre palettes often show different levels of granularity. For 
instance, Lim et al. (2005b) (following Dewe et al., 1998) include in their genre palette 
both FAQS (a genre) and journalistic materials (a super-genre). In order to get a more 
consistent genre classification, I suggest the use of prototype theory65 (Rosch, 1973a, 
1973b, 1978) to achieve a consistent level of genre granularity.  
Suitable categories that can be dealt with prototype theory can be ordered into a three-
tiered hierarchy: superordinate level, basic level and subordinate level. For example, the 
genre ADVERTISEMENT represents the basic level (genre) of the superordinate level 
                                                 
65 Paltridge (1995), Steen (1999), Lee (2001) and other linguists have already applied it to genre. 
Chapter 10 - Supervised Single-Label Genre Classification 
 153
ADVERTISING (super-genre), while a WEB AD represents the subordinate level (subgenre) 
of the basic level.  
 Super-Genre Genre Subgenre 
Superordinate Level ADVERTISING   
Basic Level  ADVERTISEMENT  
Subordinate Level   WEB AD 
 
Table 32. Genre granularity according to prototype theory 
 
The basic level, i.e. the genre, embodies the information level at which concepts are 
most easily recognized, remembered and learned with respect to their function.  
A ‘prototypical’ document should be considered different from a stereotypical 
document. While the latter implies unambiguous genre conventions, which can affect 
the performance of a classifier, a prototype document is the most typical instance of a 
more encompassing or fuzzy category. Importantly, according to prototype theory, 
instances of a genre may vary in their prototypicality, thus allowing intra-genre 
variation.  
It is worth noting that that the application of prototype theory to a genre palette is not 
based on predetermined strict rules. At this stage of research, prototype theory is used as 
a commonsense criterion that permits one to achieve a certain degree of consistency in 
genre granularity. 
In sum, when building a genre collection, one should allow the concept of genre to have 
different granularities. Arguably, a collection built with a consistent level of granularity 
returns more consistent and coherent classification results.  
Experiment 1 will show that the application of these two criteria has a positive impact 
on automatic genre classification, and that the inclusion or exclusion of a super-genre in 
the palette is reflected in the classification accuracy.

10.2.2 Feature-Related Issues 
In Chapter 6, I discussed some aspects of automatically-extractable features used in 
automatic genre identification – namely (i) genre-representativeness and discriminating 
power, and (ii) feature exportability – and pointed out that it would be desirable to have 
a feature set that represents and discriminates the genres in a corpus, and that is also 
exportable across different corpora with differing genre palettes. 
Experiment 1 will shed some light on the genre representativeness and discriminating 
power of three feature sets, also showing how exportable they are. Experiment 2 will 
show that it is profitable to have different feature sets because they can all be used for 
predictive tasks. 
10.2.3 Model-Related Issue 
The model-related issue that I want to investigate in Experiment 2 is the exportability of 
a classification model. By exportability of a classification model I refer to the degree of 
generalization that a classification model can achieve when applied to a corpus differing 
from the training and test sets it was built and tested upon. 
The basic assumption of supervised classification is that the training set and the test set 
belong to the same population (the so-called ‘PAC learning’, see Moore, 2001 and 
Bshouty and Kushilevitz, no date). In experiment 2, I investigate to what extent this 
assumption can be overridden in order to identify genres in the open web. In other 
words, Experiment 2 explores whether a supervised model can be exported and 
profitably utilized for a corpus (the test set) built with a different population than the 
model (the training set). 
In the next section I will describe and discuss Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 showing 
how they address the three issues described in this section. 
Chapter 10 - Supervised Single-Label Genre Classification 
 155
10.3 Experiments 
The experimental setting used for the two experiments described in this section includes 
three web page collections, three feature sets and an SVM classifier. In the following 
subsections I will provide some details about this setting. 
10.3.1 Three Web Page Collections 
The three web page collections used in the experiments are the 7-web-genre collection, 
the KI-04 corpus and the SPIRIT collection. These collections are described in more 
detail in Appendix A. 
7-Web-Genre Collection 
The 7-web-genre collection includes 200 English web pages for each genre, and 
amounts to a total of 1,400 web pages. The seven web genres included in the collection 
are the following: 
1. BLOG 5. LISTING 
2. ESHOP 6. PERSONAL HOME PAGE66 
3. FAQS 7. SEARCH PAGE 
4. ONLINE NEWSPAPER FRONT PAGE  
 
The 7-web genre collection has been built following the criteria of ‘annotation by 
objective sources’ and ‘consistent genre granularity’. The only exception to the criterion 
of consistent genre granularity is the LISTING super-genre, purposely included in the 
collection in order to study the effect of an inconsistent genre granularity on 
classification results. 
                                                 
66 PERSONAL HOME PAGE is the basic level of the superordinate level HOME PAGE and has 
ACADEMIC PERSONAL HOME PAGE, ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONAL HOME PAGE, etc. as 
subordinate level. Cf. also Haas and Grams (1998). 
Chapter 10 - Supervised Single-Label Genre Classification 
 156
KI-04 Corpus 
The KI-04 corpus includes 1,295 English web pages (HTML documents), but I used 
1,205 web pages because some web pages were empty. The KI-04 corpus includes the 
following web genres:  
1. ARTICLE (127 web pages) 5. DISCUSSION (127 web pages) 
2. DOWNLOAD (151 web pages) 6. HELP (139 web pages) 
3. LINK COLLECTION (205 web pages) 7. PORTRAYAL (NON-PRIV) (163 web pages) 
4. PORTRAYAL (PRIV.) (126 web pages) 8. SHOP (167 web pages) 
 
SPIRIT Collection 
The SPIRIT collection does not include any genre label. In Experiment 2, I used only 
1,000 random English web pages from this collection for predictive tasks. 
10.3.2 Three Feature Sets 
Three feature sets are employed in Experiments 1 and 2. I called these feature sets 
1_set, 2_set and 3_set. The features included in the sets are described in detail in Part II 
of this thesis and summarized in Chapter 6. The list of features and the datasets built 
with these features are available on the CD provided with this thesis. 
1_set 
1_set contains 118 features for the 7-web genre collection and 119 features for the 
KI-04 collection. The features included in 1_set are: 
• the 50 most common words in English; 
• 24 POS tags; 
• 8 punctuation symbols; 
• 7 genre-specific-word facets for the 7-web-genre collection and 8 genre-specific-word 
facets for KI-04 corpus; 
• 28 HTML tags; 
• 1 nominal attribute representing the length of the web page (see Section 6.3).  
2_set 
2_set contains 140 features for the 7-web-genre collection and 119 features for KI-04 
corpus. The features included in 2_set are: 
Chapter 10 - Supervised Single-Label Genre Classification 
 157
• 100 POS trigrams for the 7-web-genre collection and 76 POS trigrams for the KI-04 
corpus67; 
• 8 punctuation symbols (as above); 
• genre-specific-word facets (as above); 
• HTML tags (as above); 
• 1 nominal attribute (as above). 
 
3_set 
3_set contains 100 facets (described in Chapter 5 and Appendix B) for the 7-web-genre 
collection and 101 facets68 for the KI-04 corpus. The facets included in 3_set are: 
• 86 linguistic facets; 
• genre-specific-word facets (as above); 
• 6 HTML facets; 
• 1 nominal attribute (as above). 
 
10.3.3 The Classifier 
The classification algorithm used both in Experiments 1 and 2 is a support vector 
machine (SVM) classifier as implemented in Weka machine learning workbench. The 
SVM classifier in the Weka (Witten and Frank, 2005: 410) implements the Sequential 
Minimal Optimisation (SMO) for training support vectors first developed by J. Platt 
(Platt, 1999). While many implementations of SVM deal only with binary problems, 
Weka implementation supports multi-class problems, which are solved with pairwise 
classification using a voting system to predict the class (Frank and Witten, 2005: 123, 
410). I used default parameters with logistic regression models to obtain probability 
estimates instead of simple scores (Frank and Witten, 2005: 410). Figure 40 shows the 
actual parameters used in the experiments. It is also worth highlighting that SVM 
classifiers are less prone to overfitting than other classifiers (cf. Section 4.3.3). 
                                                 
67 Here POS trigrams have been selected according to coverage. I selected only those POS triples that 
appeared between 70% and 40% in the corpus. Different selection methods are used in Chapter 4 and 
Chapter 5 (see footnote 38). 
68 The KI-04 collection has one facet more than the 7-web-genre collection because it contains one genre 
more. This means that the KI-04 corpus has eight genre-specific-word facets, while the 7-web-genre 
collection has seven eight genre-specific-word facets. Cf. also footnote 71.

10.3.4 Overview of the Experiments 
The practical aim of Experiment 1 is to build two sets of single-label discrete 
classification models: one set learned from the 7-web-genre collection, the other from 
the KI-04 corpus. Both sets include three models, namely a model per feature set. 
Figure 41 shows the diagram of the experiment.  
 
 
Figure 41. Two sets of models from two web page collections 
Experiment 1 sheds some light on corpus-related issues and feature-related issues. As 
regards corpus-related issues, the experiment will show to what extent corpus 
composition and genre palette – or, simply put, the selection of genres and web pages – 
affect accuracy results. Experiment 1 is based on two different web page collections, 
built with different criteria, and containing different genre palettes. For feature-related 
issues, the experiment will show how well the three sets of features represent the genres 
included in the collections, and discriminate among them. 
The practical aim of Experiment 2 is to use the two sets of classification models built 
with Experiment 1 to make predictions on arbitrary and unclassified web pages, i.e. 
1,000 English web pages randomly extracted from the SPIRIT collection which, ideally, 
represent the open web. As recalled earlier, the basic assumption of supervised 
classification is that the training set and the test set belong to the same population. In 
this experiment, I will explore the extent of exportability of a supervised model to the 
open web. 
Chapter 10 - Supervised Single-Label Genre Classification 
 159
For both experiments the unit of analysis is the individual web page. 
10.3.5 Experiment 1: Building Classification Models 
As described in the previous section, Experiment 1 creates two sets of classification 
models, one for each web page collection, each set including three models, one model 
for each feature set (see Figure 41).  
Accuracy results of the two sets of models are summarized in Table 33. The results 
shown in this table are averages from stratified 10-fold cross-validation repeated 10 
times (Witten and Frank, 2005: 150) with different seeds69 on each model. The range of 
variation among cross-validations is relatively low, which indicates that the 
classification is stable on the datasets. As shown in Table 33, accuracy results are very 
good on the 7-web-genre collection (around 90%), but definitely lower on the KI-04 
collection (less than 70%) .

The seed number in brackets indicates that the average accuracy corresponds to the 
accuracy returned by cross-validation run with that seed number. For example, the 
average accuracy of 90.6% corresponds to the accuracy achieved specifying seed 178. A 
breakdown of the F-measures70 achieved with the seeds reported in Table 33 is shown 
in Table 34 for the 7-web-genre collection and in Table 35 for the KI-04 corpus. 
                                                 
69 Seeds are numbers that are used to randomise the data. 
70 F-measure is the measure that characterizes the overall performance, taking into consideration both 
precision and recall. The formula used in Weka is (see Witten and Frank, 2005: 172): 
(2*recall*precision)/(recall+precision).

Table 35. F-measures of the KI-04 corpus 
 
I used the number of correctly classified instances returned using the seeds shown in 
Table 33 to compute the statistical significance among these different results. 
Significance values indicate that there is not a statistically significant difference among 
the accuracy of the three feature sets on the 7-web-genre collection. For the KI-04 
corpus, on the other hand, there is a significant difference between the accuracy of 1_set 
and 2_set, but not between 1_set and 3_set, nor between 2_set and 3_set.  
In order to compare my classification accuracy with the accuracy achieved by Meyer zu 
Eissen and Stein (2004), I ran discriminant analysis (the algorithm they use) on the 
datasets built with my three feature sets. As Meyer zu Eissen and Stein (2004) ran their 
discriminant analysis only on 800 web pages from the KI-04 corpus, while I used 1,205 
web pages from the same corpus, I converted all the results into percentages. A 
breakdown of the different accuracies is shown in Table 36.

Table 36. Comparison of the accuracies of my three feature sets with MzE and Stein’ s feature set 
According to the significance values, 1_set performs significantly better than Meyer zu 
Eissen and Stein’s feature set, while the latter performs significantly better than 2_set 
and 3_set. This means that 1_set appropriately represents the genres in the KI-04 
corpus. 
Accuracies and F-measures returned by models built on the 7-web-genre collection are 
very high. Yet this collection contains a super-genre, i.e. LISTING, that disturbs the 
classification of other genres.  
According to the results returned by the classifier, the 7-web-genre collection including 
all the web genre achieves an accuracy of about 90.4% with the 1_set and seed 1 
(Figure 42). If we remove the LISTING super-genre, the classification accuracy 
significantly increases (chi-square test of significance) and reaches about 94.5% (Figure 
43). One could think that this increase is due to the lower number of web genre classes, 
i.e. six classes instead of seven, since accuracy usually improves when the number of 
classes decreases. However, this is not the case here. In this experiment, the 
enhancement of performance is not caused by the decreased number of classes, but by 
the removal of a class with an inconsistent level of genre granularity. In fact, if we keep 
the LISTING super-genre in the dataset, and remove a basic level genre, like BLOG or 
FRONT PAGE, the accuracy does not increase. Accuracy significantly deteriorates to 
about 90.4% (chi-square test of significance) when the LISTING super-genre is included 
Chapter 10 - Supervised Single-Label Genre Classification 
 162
and BLOGS are left out (Figure 44), and to about 89.5% when the LISTING super-genre is 
included and FRONTPAGES are left out (Figure 45).

These results seem to confirm the intuition that a consistent level of granularity has a 
positive impact on classification accuracy. 
Discussion 
Experiment 1 compares the accuracies of two models built with the same classification 
algorithm, the same feature sets but different web page collections, the 7-web-genre 
collection and KI-04 corpus. The accuracy on the 7-web-genre collection (1,400 web 
pages) is above 90%, while the accuracy on KI-04 corpus (1,205 web pages) is 
definitely lower.  
A first thought was that the three feature sets (1_set, 2_set and 3_set) were responsible 
for the wide gap in accuracy between the 7-web-genre collection and the KI-04 corpus, 
possibly because they did not adequately represent the genre palette of the KI-04 
corpus. Although genre-specific-word facets and POS trigrams were tailored to the 
genre palette of the two collections71, my suspicion was that some kind of bias was 
present in the feature sets. However, after having compared the performance of my 
three feature sets with Mayer zu Eissen and Stein’s (2004) feature set using the same 
algorithm (discriminant analysis) on the same collection (the KI-04 corpus), it became 
                                                 
71 This means that the genre-specific words used for the 7-web-genre collection account for BLOGS, 
SEARCH, FRONT PAGE, etc., while those employed for KI-04 corpus include words related to 
ARTICLES, DISCUSSION, DOWNLOAD, etc, and that POS trigrams were calculated independently for 
the 7-web genre collection and the KI-04 corpus. 
Chapter 10 - Supervised Single-Label Genre Classification 
 164
clear that the lower accuracy on the KI-04 corpus does not depend on the feature sets, 
because 1_set shows a higher accuracy than the accuracy stated in Mayer zu Eissen and 
Stein (2004). It seems that although the KI-04 corpus contains eight genres, i.e. one 
genre more than the 7-web-genre collection (error rate usually increases with the 
number of classes included in a classification model), this does not explain the extent of 
the gap in classification accuracy. If neither the feature sets nor the classification 
algorithm are the cause of this large discrepancy in accuracy, then it is plausible to 
suspect that the selection of web pages representing genres in the KI-04 corpus might be 
responsible for the lower performance. As the features used in this experiment are either 
corpus-independent (1_set and 3_set) or tailored to the corpus (2_set), I provisionally 
interpret the higher performance on the 7-web-genre collection as a result of the 
application of the two criteria of annotation by objective sources and consistent genre 
granularity.  
It is worth noting that the 2_set (built with POS trigrams) performs very satisfactorily 
on web pages. In Chapter 4, the high performance achieved by POS trigrams on a subset 
of the BNC was undermined by the suspicion that the good results could be caused by 
overfitting. The excellent accuracy achieved by the 2_set confirms that POS trigrams 
are valuable automatically-extractable genre-revealing features, suitable both for 
traditional documents and for web pages. 
Although mostly consistent in granularity, the 7-web-genre collection contains a super-
genre, i.e. LISTING. Experiment 1 also showed that the presence of a genre with a 
different level of granularity negatively affects accuracy results. Removing the LISTING 
super-genre from the palette, significantly increases the performance by 4.5% (chi-
square test of significance). This does not happen when LISTING is left in the palette and 
another genre, like BLOG or FRONT PAGE, is left out. I interpret the deterioration of the 
accuracy when LISTING is included in the palette as a drawback of the inconsistent genre 
granularity. 
This experiment also showed that topic-independent and corpus-independent features 
exist (cf. also Chapter 6), which can be profitably exported to arbitrary corpora with 
Chapter 10 - Supervised Single-Label Genre Classification 
 165
little adjustment. This is shown by the good classification results of 1_set and 3_set 
exported to the KI-04 corpus. These two feature sets are virtually the same except for 
genre-specific-word facets, which have been adapted to the different genre palette.  
Although 2_set is topic-independent, it is not corpus-independent (cf. also Chapter 6). 
The list of potential discriminating POS trigrams is tailored to the collections. 
Therefore, in Experiment 1 the 7-web-genre collection is represented by 100 POS 
trigrams, while the KI-04 corpus by 76. Additionally the number of POS triples, 
selection methods and thresholding remain subjective and empirical (cf. footnote 67). 
However, if we disregard the properties of generality or exportability, POS trigram 
performance on a web collection tagged with an arbitrary NLP tool, like Connexor, is as 
good as 1_set and 3_set. This confirms that POS trigrams are effective genre-revealing 
features not only on a ‘tamed’ corpus like the BNC (cf. Chapter 4), but also on an 
‘untamed’ web page collection. 
In conclusion, Experiment 1 showed that the two provisional criteria of annotation by 
objective sources and consistent level of granularity have a beneficial effect on the 
corpus-related issues of (i) corpus composition and genre palette. It also showed that the 
feature-related issues of (ii) feature representativeness and discriminating power, and 
(iii) feature exportability can be solved by using topic-independent and corpus-
independent features. In particular, some topic-independent and corpus-independent 
features, like the ones used in 1_set and 3_set, remain representative and discriminating 
also when exported to a different corpus with a differing genre palette, thus streamlining 
genre classification and reducing overhead. 
In the next subsection, I will describe some effects of exporting models to predict the 
genre of arbitrary web pages in a random web page collection. 
10.3.6 Experiment 2: Exporting Classification Models 
The idea behind Experiment 2 is to exploit the high accuracy returned by the models 
built with Experiment 1 for predicting the (web) genres of arbitrary web pages that are 
Chapter 10 - Supervised Single-Label Genre Classification 
 166
likely to be found in the open web. In this experiment, predictions are made on a sample 
of 1,000 English web pages randomly extracted from the SPIRIT collection.  
When issuing a prediction, the classifier returns a probability score to be interpreted in 
terms of classification confidence. For example, the classifier is more confident in a 
prediction with a probability score of 0.968 than in a prediction scored at 0.383 (see 
Table 37).

Table 37. An example of genre predictions issued by a supervised classification algorithm 
This classification confidence score can be exploited when assessing the value of a 
prediction and for setting the threshold between reliable and unreliable predictions, 
because a prediction score of 0.383 is undoubtedly less reliable than a prediction score 
of 0.968. The sum of probabilities values amounts to 1. 
In order to have predictions on genre labels that are as reliable as possible, I devised a 
simple voting system. Since each feature set represents a different view of the data, the 
basic idea of the approach is to exploit the three different views of the data represented 
by the three feature sets. More precisely, when the three models built with the three 
feature sets agree on the same genre label at very high confidence score, namely >=0.9, 
this is a good hint for a reliable prediction.  
Additionally, this approach can be seen as an embryonic multi-label system. Since there 
are two sets of models available, one per each web page collection, predictions will be 
made following two different genre palettes. Ideally, a web page might get a prediction 
of BLOG, following the 7-web-genre palette, and DISCUSSION following the KI-04 
palette. As the two genre palettes are mostly non-overlapping, it will be interesting to 
see how reliable double labels are on the same web page. 
Chapter 10 - Supervised Single-Label Genre Classification 
 167
I personally assessed the correct and incorrect predictions. Spreadsheets containing the 
classifiers’ predictions together with my assessment are available online and on the CD 
provided with this thesis. 
I set a tentative baseline of 1, meaning that the voting system should return at least one 
correct prediction per web genre among the unknown population of the 1,000 web 
pages extracted from SPIRIT collection. 
From to the summary shown in Table 38, it appears that a very low number of pages 
were agreed upon by the three classification models built with the 7-web-genre palette 
(second column). This is not necessarily a bad trait in itself when aiming at accurate 
results. What is not reassuring is the low number of correct predictions (third column) 
and, consequently, the high error rate (last column). Curiously, it seems that errors in 
prediction are higher for those web genres where classification models returned better 
F-measures in Experiment 1 (like BLOGS and FRONT PAGES), while correct predictions 
are higher for LISTING, which received the worst F-measures in Table 34.  
Most of the correct predictions are greater or equal to the baseline, except for the FRONT 
PAGE genre. 
The situation appears worse with the models built using the KI-04 corpus, as shown in 
Table 39. As there was no 3-out-of-3 agreement at >= 0.9 for a few genres – namely 
DISCUSSION, DOWNLOAD, HELP, and PORTRAYAL (NON-PRIV) – I included in the results 
web pages with 2-out-of-3 agreement at >= 0.9.

Only 10 web pages from the SPIRIT collection (shown in Table 40) were shared by the 
7-web-genre models and the KI-04 models. The two voting systems agreed on six web 
pages (namely, number 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 9). However, I could not detect any correctly 
double-labelled web page, as appears from Table 40. 
 
 
Table 40. Shared predictions 
Discussion 
Experiment 2 showed that the classification models built with the 7-web-genre 
collection perform better when exported to a collection of arbitrary web pages. They 
Chapter 10 - Supervised Single-Label Genre Classification 
 169
return a higher number of predictions than the models built with the KI-04 corpus. This 
seems to confirm that the use of the two criteria of annotation by objective source and 
consistent level of granularity ensures more accurate and stable classification models, 
which can be more profitably exported.  
Ideally, the approach used in Experiment 2 can be also seen as an embryonic technique 
for multi-label classification using machine learning. While with a multi-label classifier 
like LIBSVM72, each example needs to be pre-annotated with several classes, the 
approach used in Experiment 2 would be more suitable for a situation where the genres 
of the web pages are not known in advance. However, given the limitation of the 
number of predictions issued by the voting system, the potential of this multi-labelling 
approach cannot be fully assessed. 
Overall, the number of correct predictions is low. Although the experiment was very 
simple and the thresholding strategy unsophisticated73, findings show that supervised 
classification is strongly conditioned by the distribution of the population. This problem 
is well summarized by Wulfekuhler and Punch (1997):  
“the standard approach of classifying training documents can be done with high accuracy, 
but is not generalizable for classification of documents not in the training set, and is not 
useful for discovering new data”. (Wulfekuhler and Punch, 1997) 
Experiment 2 was designed to investigate whether the basic principle of inductive 
learning – i.e. that the population of the test set is expected to follow the same 
distribution as the population of the training set – could be bypassed or worked around 
in order to cope with the open web. Results show that the model-related issue of 
exportability cannot be easily solved. Consequently, supervised models remain strongly 
conditioned by the characteristics of the population of the training set. 
                                                 
72 For example, see the multi-label datasets available at the LIBSVM website: 
<http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/multilabel.html>. 
73 Cf. Yang (2001) for much more sophisticated approaches to thresholding applied to topical text 
categorization. It is to be said, however, that it is easier to experiment when there are several official and 
acknowledged benchmark collections available for evaluation purposes, as in the case of the cited paper. 
Unfortunately, there are no equivalent of Reuters-21578 or TREC collections for genre classification.

10.4 Conclusion 
This chapter investigated supervised single-label genre classification focussing on three 
aspects: (a) corpus composition and genre palette, (b) representativeness and 
exportability of features, and (c) exportability of classification models. I formulated 
these aspects in form of three issues: corpus-related issues, feature-related issues and 
model-related issue, respectively. 
For corpus-related issues, I suggested two commonsense criteria in the absence of 
official genre benchmark collections. Firstly, I proposed the construction of genre 
corpora relying on the criterion of objective sources in order to overcome the bias 
caused by subjective genre annotation. Then, I suggested checking the consistency of 
the granularity among the genres included in the palette relying on prototype theory. 
The annotation by objective source is not only less subjective and closer to real-world 
conditions, but also much faster than annotation by human raters, which is usually time-
consuming, controversial, and expensive. Further, a collection built with a consistent 
level of genre granularity seems to be learned more profitably by the classifier. 
Together, these two criteria enhance the performance of classification algorithms. These 
two criteria merely represent a starting point for a discussion about common standards 
for genre annotation. 
For feature-related issues, I showed that corpus-independent and topic-independent 
features ensure genre representativeness, are very discriminating and easily exportable. 
1_set (based on function words and POSs) and 3_set (based on facets) returned very 
high accuracies (90.6% and 88.8%, respectively) on seven web genres. Such features 
reduce overhead and are reasonably fast to compute.  
For the model-related issue, it seems that the generality of the supervised classification 
model is limited to corpora with a similar population. In Experiment 2, I challenged this 
limitation, but results, though provisional, appear discouraging. The idea of facing the 
open web with a supervised approach seems not to hold. 
Chapter 10 - Supervised Single-Label Genre Classification 
 171
Overall, the main advantage of the supervised approach to genre classification is that a 
high accuracy (about 90%) on a single genre label can be reached in a closed and static 
situation with the ideal combination of the following elements: 
• a predictable population;  
• a felicitous genre palette, i.e. a corpus of seven disparate web genres with similar level of 
granularity and annotated by the criterion of external sources;  
• mixed feature sets, i.e. the three feature sets used in the experiments all contain lexical 
items, linguistic tags, punctuation, HTML tags and genre-specific words;  
• a balanced corpus, i.e. 200 web pages per web genre;  
• a state-of-the-art classification algorithm, namely SVM as implemented in Weka;  
• prototypical web pages, i.e. web pages selected complying to prototype theory. 
 
 
The main disadvantage is that such a classification model shows a reduced generality 
and exportability, and heavily depends on the above-listed attributes. 
In the next chapter, I will present an approach more oriented to the discovery of the 
genre of web pages in the open web.

Chapter 11.  Beyond the Single Label: 
Towards a Zero-to-Multi-Genre 
Classification Scheme 
This chapter describes a model that implements a zero-to-multi-genre classification 
scheme, i.e. a scheme that enables zero-, one- and multi-genre identification within the 
individual web page. The model is based on a modified form of the Bayesian theorem 
and relies on the separation of the concepts of ‘text types’ and ‘genre’. The suggestion 
put forward through this model is that the use of text types as middle layer between 
features (the facets) and genres gives flexibility to automatic genre identification. 
Arguably, a model that implements a zero-to-multi-genre classification scheme is more 
suitable for coping with the current situation of genres in the open web. This chapter is 
organized as follows: first, it summarises the observation on text type predominance 
made by Werlich, because the model is based on this observation; second, it explains 
the methodology and reports on the evaluation; and finally, it discusses how this model 
represents a first step towards an implementable characterization of genres in web 
pages. 
11.1 Introduction 
As discussed in Chapter 1 and shown throughout this thesis, the identification of genres 
in web pages cannot be limited to the assignment of a single acknowledged genre label. 
First, I showed that there are transitional forms – the emerging genres – that do not 
show stable conventions and have no acknowledged genre designation, but can 
nonetheless be automatically captured (Chapter 7). Second, I pointed out how web users 
do not agree on a single genre label for a web page (Chapter 8). These empirical 
observations led me to suggest the inclusion of the attributes of genre hybridism and 
Chapter 11 - Beyond the Single Label: Towards a Zero-to-Multi-Genre Classification Scheme 
 173
individualisation in the characterization of the genre of web pages (Chapter 9). These 
two attributes account for classification hurdles, and help pinpoint the range of 
flexibility that an automatic classification system should have. I suggested that genre 
hybridism accounts for multi-genre classification, whereas individualisation accounts 
for zero-genre classification. This range of flexibility is not permitted by standard 
discrete single-label supervised classification algorithms, which, apparently, do not 
progress beyond the assumption that a web page can be assigned to only a single 
acknowledged genre. The use of a supervised multi-label classifier, like LIBSVM (see 
footnote 72) is discouraged by the huge amount of manual annotation that it would 
require. Additionally, the accuracy of supervised methods relies heavily on the ideal 
combination of the following elements: a predictable population, a felicitous genre 
palette, mixed feature sets, a balanced corpus, a state-of-the-art classification algorithm, 
and prototypical web pages (see Section 10.4). All these constraints proved 
inappropriate to cope with the open web. 
In this chapter I present a model that goes beyond the single-label assignment and does 
not require any annotation of web pages by genre. This model has two main 
characteristics: (i) it makes a clear-cut distinction between text types and genre, and (ii) 
it is based on Bayesian inference and not on supervised learning. 
The first original trait of this model is that it relies on the separation of the concepts of 
text types and genre (cf. Chapter 2), where text types represent a middle layer between 
functionally interpreted features – the facets – and genres. This intermediate level gives 
flexibility to an automatic genre classification system because text types are linguistic 
devices that represent the purpose of communication, and are more universal than 
genres since they span across all cultures (e.g. cf. the cross-linguistic analysis by Kim 
and Biber, 1994 and Biber et al., 2005) and all times (e.g. cf. the diachronic analyses by 
Biber and Finegan, 1989 or Biber, 2001). Genres, on the other hand, are cultural 
artefacts, linked to a historical context, and in constant evolution. Illuminatingly, 
textlinguistics has highlighted the relation between the use and distribution of text types 
and genres. Drawing from this observation, I suggest that the analysis of genres in terms 
of text types allows for single- and multi-genre assignment, in addition to single-genre 
Chapter 11 - Beyond the Single Label: Towards a Zero-to-Multi-Genre Classification Scheme 
 174
assignment. By using text types, an analysis will remain possible on all media (printing, 
the web, mobile phones, etc.) even if genres evolve and texts cannot be safely ascribed 
to any existing genre (zero-genre assignment), or if texts show several genres at the 
same time (multi-genre assignment), since text types help relate genres to one another 
across old and new media. In short, rather than automatic genre classification, this 
model implements an automatic text type and genre identification. 
The second original trait of the model presented in this chapter is that it is based on 
Bayesian inference and not on supervised learning. More precisely, text types are 
inferred using a modified form of Bayes’ theorem – the odds-likelihood or subjective 
Bayesian method – and web genres are derived using a few inferential if-then rules. For 
this reason, I refer to this model as the inferential model. 
In this inferential model, text types play the role of a ‘processed’ or ‘higher order’ 
feature. As genres cannot easily be characterized by an unambiguous set of surface 
cues, text types represent an intermediate level that provides some linguistic insights 
into genres. In this framework, a single-genre assignment can be made when a web page 
shows a distribution of text types and/or other features that can be uniquely ascribed to a 
single genre. For example, HOW-TOS can often be unambiguously characterized by an 
INSTRUCTIONAL text type laid out as a list of steps. By contrast, a zero-genre assignment 
is possible when the distribution or combination of text types and/or other features is 
unexpected and cannot be safely ascribed to any existing genre. Finally, a multi-genre 
assignment can be performed when a web page shows a distribution or combination of 
text types and/or other features that is shared across several genres. For example, 
EDITORIALS and SERMONS could be characterized by the ARGUMENTATION and 
EXPOSITION text types with a plain layout. Consequently, a web page showing these 
attributes can be classified as both a SERMON and an EDITORIAL, without specifying 
whether the page is both a SERMON and an EDITORIAL, or a SERMON within an EDITORIAL 
or vice-versa, or half a SERMON and half an EDITORIAL.  
Unfortunately, as there are no standard evaluation metrics and no reference corpus for a 
comprehensive assessment of such a model, I report a partial evaluation, deferring to 
Chapter 11 - Beyond the Single Label: Towards a Zero-to-Multi-Genre Classification Scheme 
 175
future research the evaluation of the model as a whole. The evaluation presented in this 
chapter mainly focuses on three aspects: single-label evaluation, predictions and 
scalability. 
Before describing the methodology underlying the model, I give a short account of 
Werlich’s observation about text type predominance in genres. 
11.2 Genres and Text Type Predominance 
As mentioned in Chapter 2, textlinguists, like Werlich (1976) and Adam (2005), point 
out the relation between genres and text types. Genre analysts, like Paltridge (1996), 
confirm that analysing genres in terms of text types is a fruitful approach. This view is 
confirmed by qualitative genre-specific analysis, such as the recent analysis of the HOME 
PAGE genre interpreted using Adam’s text typology by Askehave and Nielsen (2004). 
As the corpus-based approach to text types proposed by Biber focuses more on text type 
detection across genres than on automatic genre classification, with the model presented 
in this chapter I try to implement an automatic approach based on text type detection, 
and geared towards the identification of genres within the individual web page. 
The basic idea underlying the model relies on Werlich’s observation that genres are 
characterized by recurrent or predominant text types. Werlich does not use the word 
‘genre’ in his Text Grammar; instead he talks about ‘text forms’ and ‘text form 
variants’. More precisely, he states: 
“(1) The term text form is used to refer to those manifestations of a text type which are 
conventionally considered as the dominant manifestations of that particular type (e.g. a 
comment is considered as the dominant manifestation of subjective argumentation, while 
the leading article or the review are more specific variants). 
(2) The term text form variant is used to refer to those manifestations of a text form which 
are composed in accordance with a conventionally fixed compositional plan (e.g. the 
leading article and the review are text form variants of the comment”. (Werlich, 1976: 46) 
[italics and numbering in the original] 
Werlich does not analyse genres, but text types. However, in his description of text 
types he reports on the distribution (but not a statistical distribution) of the text type 
under analysis. For example: 
Chapter 11 - Beyond the Single Label: Towards a Zero-to-Multi-Genre Classification Scheme 
 176
“As regards distribution, instructions are most frequent as distinct text division of 
comments [...], reports [...], sermons and prayers, letters (in particular business letters), 
political speeches, and various pieces of propaganda”. (Werlich, 1976: 126) [italics in the 
original] 
Additionally, he lists and describes the specific features (morphological, syntactic and 
discourse features) correlated to each of the text types in his typology,  
Werlich’s observation has never been tested empirically. However, although Werlich’s 
Text Grammar is far from any corpus-based or computational approach to text analysis, 
and far from any suggestions about genres on the web, I thought that the observation 
about the distribution and the predominance of text types in genres, together with his 
collection and description of features, could be exploited computationally for genres of 
web pages.  
In the implementation of the model described in the following section, I integrated 
Werlich’s (1976) findings with findings from Biber’s studies (Biber, 1988, 1989; Biber 
et al., 1999), with genre-specific analyses carried out in terms of text types, such as 
Roberts (1998), Vastergaard (2000), and Herring et al. (2004), and finally, with personal 
observations.  
In the next section, I will show how I implemented Werlich’s observation in the 
inferential model.  
11.3 Methodology 
In this long section, I first provide a high level overview of the approach. Secondly, I 
account for the composition of the web corpus on which the model is based. Thirdly, I 
describe how the two inferential approaches (Bayesian inference and if-then rules) are 
applied. Finally, I report on the evaluation of the results. 
Overview of the Approach 
The pipeline of the implemented approach is shown in Figure 46. The approach can be 
applied to any written or digital genre. Starting from the top, the process includes the 
following steps: 
Chapter 11 - Beyond the Single Label: Towards a Zero-to-Multi-Genre Classification Scheme 
 177
• Automatic extraction of functionally-motivated features – the facets – from a corpus 
representing the web. 
• Inference of four text types – DESCRIPTIVE_NARRATIVE, EXPLICATORY_INFORMATIONAL, 
ARGUMENTATIVE_PERSUASIVE and INSTRUCTIONAL – from linguistic facets using a 
modified form of Bayes’ theorem.  
 
Inferred text types are associated to a probability value. The term ‘probability’ is 
being used rather loosely here, to mean the degree to which a text is argumentative, 
narrative, etc. For example, a web page can have 0.9 probabilities of being 
argumentative, 0.7 of being instructional and so on. Probabilities are interpreted in 
terms of degree or gradation. For example, a web page with a probability of 0.9 of 
being argumentative shows a very high degree, or gradation, of ARGUMENTATION. As 
explained later, the different gradations are independent from each other. In other 
words, the different probability values accounting for the four text types in a web 
page do not sum up to 1.0, but they simply indicate the gradation, and not the 
proportion, of a certain text type. 
 
• Gradations/probabilities are then ranked in descending order (the highest probability 
gets the first position).  
 
After the ranking, two hypotheses are tested: 
 
• The first hypothesis says that the combination of a number of text types is sufficient 
to derive four BBC web genres – EDITORIALS, DIY MINI-GUIDES, SHORT 
BIOGRAPHIES, and FEATURE ARTICLES –, more traditional in their textuality.  
 
• The second hypothesis says that the combination of two predominant text types, i.e. 
the top-ranked text types, plus a combination of additional traits is sufficient to 
derive seven web genres – BLOGS, ESHOPS, FAQS, FRONT PAGES, LISTINGS, 
PERSONAL HOME PAGES, and SEARCH PAGES –, more influenced by the functionalities 
allowed by the web.  
 
For both hypotheses, the individual web page as a whole is taken as unit of analysis, 
without removing any textual component. 
There is no special reason for combining only two predominant text types instead of 
three or more. The basic assumption is that web pages are mixed. With BBC web 
genres, I stress the intra-genre linguistic mixture, while with seven novel web genres I 
include additional traits, like layout and functionality, in the genre profiling. Obviously, 
web pages may contain many other text types, not only the four broad text types 
included in the model. This text typology is a starting point and can be enlarged in 
future. 
Chapter 11 - Beyond the Single Label: Towards a Zero-to-Multi-Genre Classification Scheme 
 178
It is worth highlighting that the computation of text types as an intermediate step 
between facets and genres is useful if we see genres as conventionalised and 
standardized cultural objects raising expectations about the purposes of communication. 
For example, what we expect from an EDITORIAL is an ‘opinion’ or a ‘comment’ by the 
editor, which represents, broadly speaking, the view of the newspaper or magazine. 
Opinions are a form of ARGUMENTATION. ARGUMENTATION is a rhetorical pattern, or text 
type, expressed by a combination of linguistic features (the facets). If a document shows 
a high probability of being argumentative, i.e. if it has a high gradation of 
ARGUMENTATION, this document has a good chance of belonging to argumentative 
genres, such as EDITORIALS, SERMONS, PLEADINGS, and ACADEMIC PAPERS. It has less 
chances of being a STORY or a BIOGRAPHY, which are narrative genres.

 179
The computational model represented by the pipeline in Figure 46 tries to combine the 
advantages of both deductive and inductive approaches. It is deductive because it makes 
use of previous knowledge. It is also inductive because it draws from empirical data.  
More specifically, there is a deductive phase where the co-occurrence of facets in text 
types and the combination of text types (with or without additional traits) to derive web 
genres are decided a priori by the analyst on the basis on previous studies, and not 
derived by a statistical procedure, which is too biased towards high frequencies (some 
linguistic phenomena can be rare, but nonetheless discriminating). There is also an 
inductive phase because the inference of text types is corpus-based.  
In the next subsection I describe the composition of the web corpus used to make 
inferences. 
11.3.1 Web Corpus 
Since the web is in constant flux, it is almost impossible to compile a representative 
corpus/sample of the web as a whole (the multi-lingual web), or only of a single 
language, like the English web. There are estimates of the number of indexed web pages 
(in April 2005 Google could search 8,058,044,651 web pages; cf. Kilgarriff and 
Grefenstette, 2003 for previous estimates), which is a daily growing number, but we do 
not know anything about the proportions of the different types of text on the web, as 
pointed out by Kilgarriff and Grefenstette (2003). Very recently, interesting approaches 
have been proposed to automatically create corpora from the web, but these methods are 
biased towards the construction of corpora having topic or domain as priority, rather 
than genre (Ciaramita and Baroni, 2006; Sharoff, 2006).  
From a statistical point of view, when the composition of a population is unknown, the 
best solution is to extract a large random sample and draw inferences from that sample. 
However, deciding the size of this random sample is not a trivial issue. The solution that 
I suggest for this model is to approximate one of the possible compositions of a random 
Chapter 11 - Beyond the Single Label: Towards a Zero-to-Multi-Genre Classification Scheme 
 180
slice of the web – proportions are purely arbitrary74 – statistically supported by reliable 
standard error measures. Therefore, I built a web corpus with the composition shown in 
Table 41 and the standard error measures listed in Appendix A. Since the standard error 
measures of the corpus are very small, I consider the sampling distribution of the web 
corpus mean as approximately normal, following the Central Limit Theorem75. This fact 
is very important because the inferential model is based on z-scores, and z-scores 
assume a normal distribution of the sample.

As shown in Table 41, the web corpus includes four BBC web genres – EDITORIALS, 
DIY MINI-GUIDES, SHORT BIOGRAPHIES, and FEATURE ARTICLES (see Appendix E for a 
description) – and seven novel web genres – BLOGS, ESHOPS, FAQS, FRONT PAGES, 
LISTINGS, PERSONAL HOME PAGES, and SEARCH PAGES (see Appendix E for a 
                                                 
74 The only simple assumption that I made is that at least half of web users tend to use recognized generic 
patterns in order to achieve felicitous communication. 
75 Standard error is designed to be a measure of stability of sampling error. A small value indicates greater 
stability or smaller sampling error. In these conditions, the sampling distribution of the sample mean is 
approximately normal, no matter what the form of the population distribution. This is the power of 
Central Limit Theorem for large n (i.e. for a number of examples > 30): the sampling distribution of the 
sample mean is approximately normal even when the population is not (cf. Agresti and Finlay, 1997:103-
111).

description). These web genres represent the known part of the web, i.e. about 60% of 
the sample. The SPIRIT collection of unclassified web pages (described in Appendix A) 
amounts to about 40% and represents the unknown part of the web. The four BBC 
genres represent traditional genres adapted to the functionalities of the web, while the 
seven novel web genres are either unprecedented or showing a loose kinship with paper 
genres. 
In the next section, I will show how text types are inferred from facets extracted from 
this web corpus using a modified form of Bayes’ theorem. 
11.3.2 Inferring Text Types with Odds-Likelihood 
Four Broad Text Types 
In this first implementation of the inferential model I included four broad intuitive text 
types: DESCRIPTIVE_NARRATIVE, EXPLICATORY_INFORMATIONAL, ARGUMENTATIVE_PERSUASIVE 
and INSTRUCTIONAL. These text types are coarse conglomerates, and can be refined in 
future.  
The linguistic features for these text types come from previous (corpus-)linguistic 
studies, and are not extracted from the corpus using statistical methods. The linguistic 
features used in the model are the linguistic facets (see Chapter 5 and Appendix B). As 
explained in Section 5.3, linguistic facets encompass functional interpretations of 
features. These interpretations have been proposed in previous studies, like Werlich 
(1976) or Biber et al. (1999). 
The co-occurrence of linguistic facets in text types was determined following these 
sources: the BBC Skillswise website (see footnote 18, Chapter 2), Werlich (1976), Biber 
(1988, 1989), and Biber et al. (1999).  
A description of the four text types and the co-occurrence of their features used in this 
implementation of the model are provided in Appendix G. It is important to note that 
linguistic facets can occur in more than one text type. For example, time clauses occur 
both in the DESCRIPTIVE_NARRATIVE text type and in the INSTRUCTIONAL text type. What 
Chapter 11 - Beyond the Single Label: Towards a Zero-to-Multi-Genre Classification Scheme 
 182
is particular and unique to a text type is the co-occurrence of the linguistic facets, and 
not the presence of a single facet. Linguistic facets contribute to text types in the way 
shown in the next section. 
Inferential model 
As far as I am aware, an inferential approach has never been applied to automatic genre 
identification. Inferential approaches have been used extensively, instead, in Artificial 
Intelligence. In particular, the inferential model adopted here, i.e. the form of Bayes’ 
theorem called odds-likelihood or subjective Bayesian method, was suggested by Duda 
and co-workers (Duda et al., 1979; Duda et al., 1981) to handle uncertainty in 
PROSPECTOR, a rule-based system for classifying mineral exploration prospects. 
However, the approach presented here has nothing of PROSPECTOR’s complexity. 
PROSPECTOR is a sophisticated rule-based system and the inference is applied to 
assess the certainty or reliability of the rules (which could be modified interactively), 
while in my approach the inference is merely applied to the normalized frequencies of 
features (i.e. the linguistic facets), converted to probabilities. The main reason for 
choosing the odds-likelihood form of Bayes’ theorem is that the model is very simple, 
but allows more complex reasoning through the use of weights (see below).  
Like the standard Bayesian version, the odds-likelihood method is based on 
probabilities. Odds and probabilities contain exactly the same information and are 
interconvertible. But odds are not limited to the range 0-1, like probabilities. In other 
words, odds is a number (without any limitation) that tells us how much more likely one 
hypothesis is than the other76. The main difference between the regular Bayes models 
and the subjective one is that in the latter attributes are NOT considered to be equally 
important, but are, instead, weighted according to their probability value. Therefore, in 
the odds-likelihood version of Bayes’ theorem much of the effort is devoted to weighing 
                                                 
76 In practice, in order to convert odds to probabilities, we have to add the chances. So if the odds against 
a horse winning are 4 to 1, this means that, out of 5 (4+1) chances, the horse has 1 chance of winning. So 
the probability of the horse winning is 1/5, i.e. 0.2 or 20%.  
Chapter 11 - Beyond the Single Label: Towards a Zero-to-Multi-Genre Classification Scheme 
 183
the contributions of different pieces of evidence in establishing the match with a 
hypothesis.  
These weights are confidence measures: Logical Sufficiency (LS) and Logical 
Necessity (LN). LS is used when the evidence is known to exist (larger value means 
greater sufficiency), while LN is used when evidence is known NOT to exist (a smaller 
value means greater necessity). LS(E|H) expresses how much the prior odds O(H) in 
presence of a clear evidence of E, has to be multiplied in order to get the posterior odds 
O(H|E). LS is typically a number > 1, and is a measure of how sufficient the evidence is 
for the hypothesis. LN(E|H) expresses how much the prior odds O(H), in presence of a 
clear evidence against E, has to be multiplied in order to get the posterior odds O(H|E). 
LN is typically a number < 1, and it measures the necessity of the evidence for the 
hypothesis. Usually LS*LN=1. One important point to make is that the facets, i.e. the 
pieces of evidence, are not just either present or absent: their presence or absence is 
considered to be uncertain. Therefore, LS and LN can be viewed as the limits of the 
interval in which lies the value indicating the degree to which a facet influences the 
prior probability of H. In this implementation of the model, LS was set to 1.25 and LS 
was set to 0.8 on the basis of previous experience and empirical adjustments. For 
example, I tried LS: 1.43, LN: 0.7; LS: 2.0, LN: 0.57; LS: 3.33, LN: 0.3. However, 
there was not much variation among the inferred text types using different values of LS 
and LN, and this indicates stability of both facets and text types. While in this 
implementation of the model, LS and LN have a single value for all the facets (i.e. LS is 
always 1.25 and LN always 0.8), it is also possible to compute a weight for each facet. 
But in order to do so, it would be necessary to have a corpus of documents already 
classified by text types, which is not a trivial endeavour, as pointed out in Subsection 
11.3.4.1. 
As for statistical independence, odds-likelihood has the same assumption as the 
standard version of Bayes’ theorem. This means that facets must be independent from 
each other and this is indeed the case. In other words, facets are not necessarily unique 
to a single text type and the presence of a facet in a text is not influenced or does not 
Chapter 11 - Beyond the Single Label: Towards a Zero-to-Multi-Genre Classification Scheme 
 184
influence the presence of another facet. What is unique in a text type is the co-
occurrence of facets. 
Steps 
Inferences are made following the steps in List 1. Once the gradations/probabilities have 
been calculated, they are ranked in descending order. Figure 47 shows a snippet from 
the output with the web page name in the first column, the gradations/probabilities of 
text types in the second, third, fourth, and fifth columns and the two predominant text 
types in the sixth column. 
The code is written in Perl. The program is included in the CD attached to this thesis. 
1) Representation of the web in a corpus that is approximately normal. 
2) Extraction, count and normalization of linguistic facets. 
3) Conversion of normalized counts into z-scores, which represent the deviation from the ‘norm’ 
coming out from the web corpus. The concept of ‘gradation’ is based on these deviations from the 
norm. 
4) Conversion of z-scores into probabilities, which means that facet frequencies are seen in terms of 
probabilities distribution. 
5) Calculation of prior odds from prior probabilities of a text type. The prior probability for each of the 
four text types was set to 0.25 (all text types were given an equal chance to appear in a web page). 
Prior odds are calculated with the formula: 
 
prior_Odds(H)=prior_Prob(H)/1-prior_Prob(H) 
  
6) Calculation of weighted facets, or multipliers (M). If a facet, i.e. a piece of evidence (E), has a 
probability >=0.5, LS is applied, otherwise LN is applied. Multipliers are calculated with the 
following formulae: 
 
if Prob (E)>=0.5 then  
 M(E)=1+(LS-1)(Prob(E)-0.5)/0.25 
 
if Prob (E)<0.5 then 
 M(E)=1-(1-LN)(0.5-Prob(E)/0.25 
 
7) Multiplication of weighted probabilities together, according to the co-occurrence decided by the 
analyst on the basis of previous studies. 
8) Posterior odds for the text type is then calculated by multiplying prior odds (step 5) with co-
occurrence of weighted facets (step 7).  
9) Finally, posterior odds is re-converted into a probability value with the following formula: 
 
Prob(H)=Odds(H)/1+Odds(H)

11.3.3 Inferring Genres with if-then Rules 
As mentioned earlier, simple if-then rules combine inferred text types with additional 
traits for determining genres in web pages. The main reason for not applying odds-
likelihood here is that the combination of text types with other features is more 
tentative; inference rules allow us to better understand how a conclusion is reached.  
The number of positive rules, i.e. those that confirm the presence of positive attributes 
for the genre under assessment, is very limited (e.g. see Box 4): 
• 3 rules for each of the BBC genres; 
• 4 rules for BLOGS; 
• 7 rules for ESHOPS; 
• 5 rules for FAQS; 
• 8 rules for FRONT PAGES; 
• 5 rules for LISTINGS; 
• 4 rules for PHP; 
• 9 rules for SEARCH PAGE. 
 
The number of negative rules, i.e. those that disconfirm the presence of positive 
attributes for the genre under assessment is very low for BLOGS (e.g. see Box 5), and 
slightly higher for other web genres (see the code on the CD attached to the thesis). 
The rules are drawn up on the basis of previous genre studies or of a cursory qualitative 
analysis. For example, rules for BBC EDITORIALS are taken from Werlich (1976: 112) 
and Vastergaard (2000: 102), and rules for personal home pages are based on the 
observations made by Roberts (1998) and Dillon and Gushrowski (2000). When 
previous studies were not available, as in the case of ESHOPS or SEARCH PAGES, I 
personally browsed the web pages belonging to these genres to extract generalizations 
that could be expressed in rules. 
The actual rules for deriving BBC EDITORIALS are simple, as shown in Box 2: 
Chapter 11 - Beyond the Single Label: Towards a Zero-to-Multi-Genre Classification Scheme 
 186
if (text_type_1=argumentative_persuasive_1|expository_informational_1 
if (text_type_2=expository_informational_2  
if (text_type_4=instructional_3|instructional_4 
 
Box 2. Rules for BBC editorials 
That is, web pages where the ARGUMENTATIVE_PERSUASIVE text type is ranked first, 
where the EXPOSITORY_INFORMATIONAL text type is ranked first or second, and where the 
INSTRUCTIONAL text type is ranked either third or fourth, can be considered good 
editorial candidates. 
Similarly, three rules are enough for identifying DIY MINI-GUIDES: 
if (text_type_1=/instructional_1|argumentative_persuasive_1/) 
if (text_type_2=/argumentative_persuasive_2|instructional_2/) 
if (text_type_3/expository_informational_3|descriptive_narrative_4/) 
 
Box 3. Rules for BBC DIY mini-guides 
Rules for novel web genres are, on the other hand, slightly different, because these 
genres show a textuality more influenced by the interaction allowed by the web, such as 
a more complex layout and or more sophisticated functionality. In general, these rules 
combine two predominant text types, i.e. the top-ranked text types, plus other traits. For 
example, the entire set of rules for BLOGS are shown in Box 4 and Box 5. 
if (text_type_1=descr_narrat_1|argum_pers_1) 
then add 1 to goodBlogCandidate 
 
if (text_type_2=descr_narrat_2|argum_pers_2) 
 then add 1 to goodBlogCandidate 
 
if (page_length=LONG) 
then add 1 to goodBlogCandidate 
 
if (blog_words >= 0.5 probabilities) 
then add 1 to goodBlogCandidate 
 
if goodBlogCandidate >=3 
then good BLOG candidate. 
 
Box 4. Positive rules for blogs 
if ($frontpage_words > $blog_words) 
then subtract 1 to goodBlogCandidate 
 
Box 5. Negative rules for blogs 
Chapter 11 - Beyond the Single Label: Towards a Zero-to-Multi-Genre Classification Scheme 
 187
Rules for BLOGS do not encompass any web-related trait, like navigability or 
functionality. Although very discriminating on a web corpus of 2,480 web pages, when 
the corpus is re-scaled to a larger size these rules lose some discriminating power, as 
described later. This does not happen when the set of rules includes web-related 
attributes, as in the case of ESHOP (see some of the ESHOP rules in Box 6).  
if text_type_1=instructional_1|expository_informational_1 
then add 1 to goodEshopCandidate 
 
if text_type_2=instructional_2|expository_informational_2|descriptive_narrative_2 
 then add 1 to goodEshopCandidate 
 
if page length eq (MEDIUM)) 
 then add 1 to goodEshopCandidate 
 
if eshop_words >= 0.5 
 then add 1 to goodEshopCandidate 
 
if layout >= 0.5 
 then add 1 to goodEshopCandidate 
 
if typography >= 0.5) 
 then add 1 to goodEshopCandidate 
 
if navigability_general >= 0.5) 
 then add 1 to goodEshopCandidate 
 
Box 6. Some of the rules used for identifying eshops 
The efficiency of the different sets of rules will become more evident when discussing 
the scalability of the model on pages 206-209. 
11.3.4 Evaluation of the Results 
As far as I am aware, no comprehensive evaluation metrics exist for a zero-to-multi-
genre classification scheme. For this reason, I performed partial evaluations, assessing 
different aspects of the results. More specifically, I carried out a limited evaluation of 
text types (Subsection 11.3.4.1) and a single-genre assessment of the BBC web genres 
(Subsection 11.3.4.2) and of seven web genres (Subsection 11.3.4.3). Then I used 
predictions as a kind of evaluation metric to measure the generality of the model. 
Finally, I tested the scalability of this framework adding the KI-04 corpus to my web 
corpus. 
Chapter 11 - Beyond the Single Label: Towards a Zero-to-Multi-Genre Classification Scheme 
 188
For each web page, the model produces (i) gradations of four text types, and (ii) a zero-
to-multi genre assignment. Each text type and each genre is computed independently 
from one another. Ideally, this ensures a more objective analysis of the web page, 
because I do not assume any relation between the different areas of the visual space of a 
web page. For example, in Figure 48, I assume there is no relation between the body of 
the web page, the horizontal menu at the top with the search field, and the two vertical 
menus on the sides. Nonetheless, all these different partitions contribute to the textuality 
of the whole page.  
In the next subsection, I will report on the evaluation of text types. 
 
 
Figure 48. A BBC web page  
11.3.4.1 Evaluation of Text Types 
As it is rare to find pure text types in real documents, it is difficult to annotate a corpus 
in terms of several text types, and to devise a proper evaluation of the different 
gradations of text types. Here, I present a limited evaluation of a preliminary version of 
Chapter 11 - Beyond the Single Label: Towards a Zero-to-Multi-Genre Classification Scheme 
 189
the model carried out using human subjects. This evaluation includes four human raters, 
two small sets of web pages, and gamma test.  
The evaluation set was made up of 78 web pages downloaded from websites suggested 
by the BBC Skillswise website (tutor page77) as sources of text type examples. The 
evaluation set includes 20 BBC articles selected as representatives of the 
EXPLICATORY_INFORMATIVE text type78; 20 BBC pages about historic figures chosen as 
representatives of the NARRATIVE_DESCRIPTIVE text type79; 20 BBC DIY pages 
downloaded as representatives of the INSTRUCTIONAL text type80; 18 between LEADERS 
and COMMENTS downloaded from The Guardian website as representatives of the 
ARGUMENTATIVE_PERSUASIVE text type81. The final working corpus contains a total of 
1,078 web pages. 
The gradations of text types for the evaluation set are reported in Spreadsheets 1, 2, 3 
and 4. The highlighted cells under the headings narrative, inform(ational), 
argum(entative) and instruct(ional) show the predominant text type for a web page. 
Gradations are returned in terms of probability values. For example, the first web page 
in Spreadsheet 1 shows a predominant gradation of narrative type, a lower gradation of 
informational type, and an even lower degree of instructional type; the argumentative 
type is definitely minor.  
The best performance is for INFORMATIONAL and INSTRUCTIONAL web pages (see 
Spreadsheets 1 and 2). For ARGUMENTATIVE and NARRATIVE web pages (Spreadsheets 3 
and 4), the predominant text type has a very thin margin over the others.

Chapter 11 - Beyond the Single Label: Towards a Zero-to-Multi-Genre Classification Scheme 
 190
In order to evaluate the gradations, two tests with four human subjects were set up. 
In both tests, the gradations of the four text types were converted into a rank in 
descending order of importance. For example, the text types of the last web page in 
Spreadsheed 4 were ranked as follows: 1) ARGUMENTATIVE; 2) INFORMATIONAL; 3) 
NARRATIVE; 4) INSTRUCTIONAL. 
  
Spreadsheet 1. Informational web pages Spreadsheet 2. Instructional web pages 
  
  
Spreadsheet 3. Narrative web pages Spreadsheet 4. Argumentative web pages 
 
The two tests were set relying on two human raters per test. For each test, the ranking of 
the model on the web pages was compared with the ranking of the two human raters in 
three pairs – Subject 1 vs. Subject 2, Subject 1 vs. System, Subject 2 vs. System. Then 
Chapter 11 - Beyond the Single Label: Towards a Zero-to-Multi-Genre Classification Scheme 
 191
the level of concordance was measured for each pair for each web page using the 
gamma statistic. 
More specifically, in Test 1, two subjects were asked to rank the four text types in 12 
web pages selected from the evaluation set (see the highlighted file names in 
Spreadsheets 1, 2 3 and 4). Then the ranks returned by subjects were compared with the 
ranks derived from the system. The Gamma test82, also called Goodman and Kruskal's 
gamma, was used to compare the ranks. Gamma is a measure based on ‘greater than’ 
and ‘lesser than’ operations, and assesses the difference between concordant and 
discordant pairs. It is a symmetric measure ranging from +1 to –1. It takes a positive 
value if the number of concordant pairs is larger; it is negative, if the opposite occurs; it 
is zero if the number of concordant and discordant pairs is the same. The Gamma values 
for the evaluation set are shown in Figure 49, LHS, where column 2 shows the level of 
agreement between the two subjects; columns 3 and 4 show the level of agreement 
between each subject and the system. The level of agreement among the two subjects 
and the system is very coherent. Only two cases are negative. Sometimes, the subjects 
agree better with the system than with each other. 
In Test 2, the rankings of 10 web pages belonging to the SPIRIT collection were 
evaluated. Two different human subjects were asked to rank them following the same 
criteria as in Test 1. Once again I compared the level of agreement between the two 
subjects and between each subject and the system. The Gamma values for the SPIRIT 
set are shown in Figure 49, RHS. This time too the level of agreement among human 
subjects and the system is very coherent. There are only 3 negative cases. These two 
subjects tend to agree more between them, and subject 1 seems to be particularly tuned 
with the system.  
                                                 
82 Gamma is a simplified form of Kendall’s tau-b that does not handle tied ranks (cf. Norusis, 1999: 84-
85). Ordinal data are assumed for the gamma test, but also nominal data (like the four text types of the 
model) might be used. However, when nominal data is used, some information is lost in the process (cf. 
<http://www2.chass.ncsu.edu/garson/pa765/assocordinal.htm>. 
Chapter 11 - Beyond the Single Label: Towards a Zero-to-Multi-Genre Classification Scheme 
 192
From these two tests it appears that the gradations of text types returned by the system 
largely match those returned by human subjects.

Discussion 
Overall, the results of the evaluation described in the previous subsections and carried 
out on a preliminary version of the model look promising. However, it is a small-scale 
evaluation based on a few subjects and a restricted number of web pages. As 
highlighted earlier, evaluating several text types in a large sample of documents is not a 
trivial problem for two main reasons: the absence of an official or public reference 
corpus, and the lack of common criteria for assessing the level of different text types. 
Some attempts for retrieving a single text type have been made recently (e.g. cf. the 
approach for ranking web documents according to the proportion of procedural83 text 
type they contain proposed by Yin and Power, 2006). However, measuring several text 
types requires the development of a multi-labelled evaluation corpus, which is not the 
object of the research presented in this thesis. For this reason, in the current version of 
the model, the evaluation of text types is done indirectly, through the identification of 
web genres. That is, if the web genres included in the BBC collection and in the 7-web-
genre collection are identified with a good accuracy rate, this implicitly means that the 
detection of text types in web pages is satisfying. 
                                                 
83 As mentioned in Chapter 2, the procedural text type belongs to Longacre’s (1978, 1983) text typology. 
Chapter 11 - Beyond the Single Label: Towards a Zero-to-Multi-Genre Classification Scheme 
 193
In the next section I will start by evaluating the four web genres included in the BBC 
web genre collection.  
11.3.4.2 Evaluation of Four BBC Web Genres 
As stated in Section 11.3, the first hypothesis tested with the current version of the 
inferential model indicates that a combination of predominant text types, tested with if-
then rules, is sufficient to derive the four BBC web genres included in the web corpus.  
The small BBC web genre collection (described in more detail in Appendix A) contains 
traditional genres (EDITORIALS, DIY MINI-GUIDES, SHORT BIOGRAPHIES, and FEATURE 
ARTICLES) adapted to the functionality of the web (a short description of these web 
genres can be found in Appendix D). I selected these BBC web genres as 
representatives of “extant” and “variant” cybergenres (cf. Shepherd and Watters, 1998) 
and they are meant to represent the adaptation of culturally stable and widely 
acknowledged genres to a new medium, the web. I call them ‘BBC web genres’ because 
they comply closely with the BBC style of appearance and are hence very regular in 
their layout and format. The first hypothesis tested with the inferential model is that this 
kind of stable and regular genres can be derived relying only on the combination of 
predominant text types. 
Figure 50 shows the accuracy results of 20 BBC DIY MINI-GUIDES as outputted by the 
model. The first row indicates that 19 out of 20 DIY web pages were considered to be 
good candidates for the DIY MINI-GUIDE genre. The second row says that out of 20 DIY 
MINI-GUIDES, none was considered to be a good candidate for the BBC EDITORIAL 
genre. The third row suggests that one DIY web page could also be a good candidate for 
the SHORT BIOGRAPHY (i.e. ‘bio’) genre. Finally, the fourth row reports that six DIY web 
pages have been judged good candidates for the FEATURE genre.  
The model does not assume that a web page belongs to only one single genre, because a 
web page can be a DIY MINI-GUIDE and bear some traits of the FEATURE genre, together 
with traits of BIOGRAPHY. However, the current evaluation only confirms that the 19 
web pages classified as DIY MINI-GUIDES by the BBC website are considered to be good 
Chapter 11 - Beyond the Single Label: Towards a Zero-to-Multi-Genre Classification Scheme 
 194
candidates for the DIY MINI-GUIDES according to the inferential model (first row in 
Figure 50). 
 
 
Figure 50. Snippet from the output: accuracy of 20 BBC DIY mini-guides 
As stated above, the evaluation of text types is carried out indirectly through genre 
classification accuracy. For example, the text types identified in the DIY MINI-GUIDES 
are shown in Figure 51. 
 
 
Figure 51. Snippet from the output: predominant text types in DIY mini-guides 
The large majority of the DIY MINI-GUIDES are INSTRUCTIONAL and 
ARGUMENTATIVE_PERSUASIVE. More precisely, 100% DIY MINI-GUIDES present 
INSTRUCTIONAL text types, 90% as first ranked and 10% as second ranked. 70% DIY 
MINI-GUIDES show the combination of INSTRUCTIONAL and ARGUMENTATIVE_PERSUASIVE 
text types, 60% with INSTRUCTIONAL in the first position and 10% with INSTRUCTIONAL in 
the second position. To a lower extent INSTRUCTIONAL is combined with 
EXPOSITORY_INFORMATIONAL (20%) and with DESCRIPTIVE_NARRATIVE (10%). As stated 
by Werlich (1976:131), the INSTRUCTIONAL text type is frequent in GUIDES and 
Chapter 11 - Beyond the Single Label: Towards a Zero-to-Multi-Genre Classification Scheme 
 195
MANUALS. GUIDES often contain technical description characterized by the EXPOSITORY 
text type (Werlich, 1976: 85), which is often combined with the ARGUMENTATIVE text 
type (Werlich, 1976: 121). 
By applying the three if-then rules for INSTRUCTIONAL text type shown in Box 3, very 
high accuracy is obtained. These rules discriminate strongly against BBC EDITORIALS 
and SHORT BIOGRAPHIES because none of the DIY MINI-GUIDES was classified as 
EDITORIAL, and only one as BIOGRAPHY. However, six DIY MINI-GUIDES were assessed 
as FEATURES. This is not surprising, many FEATURE ARTICLES contain set of instructions, 
like the ‘Dos’ and ‘Don’ts’, shown in Figure 67, Appendix D. 
Similar to BBC DIY MINI-GUIDES, also BBC SHORT BIOGRAPHIES show a clear pattern 
of text types (Figure 52). A biography is intuitively narrative and informational, and this 
is the pattern that emerges from text type analysis.  
 
 
Figure 52. Snippet from the output: predominant text types in BBC short-biographies 
With three rules an accuracy of 85% can be reached (Figure 53, third line): 
 
 
Figure 53. Snippet from the output: accuracy of BBC short-biographies 
Chapter 11 - Beyond the Single Label: Towards a Zero-to-Multi-Genre Classification Scheme 
 196
These rules discriminate well vs. DIYS (Figure 53, first line) and vs. FEATURES (Figure 
53, fourth line), but they overlap with EDITORIALS (Figure 53, second line).  
BBC EDITORIALS show a more fragmented pattern (Figure 54). 
 
 
Figure 54. Snippet from the output: predominant text types in BBC editorials 
Three rules are enough to reach a reasonably good accuracy (Figure 55, second line). 
However, the overlap with other BBC genres is more extensive, especially with 
BIOGRAPHIES (Figure 55, third line):

BBC FEATURE ARTICLES show the most fragmented text type pattern (see Figure 56):

Discussion 
These results support the first hypothesis that a combination of predominant text types, 
tested with if-then rules, is sufficient to derive the four BBC web genres included in the 
web corpus. More specifically, BBC DIYS and SHORT BIOGRAPHIES show very clear-cut 
text type patterns. FEATURES and EDITORIALS show more fragmented text type patterns. 
This is partly due to the fact the text types used in these experiments are only four and 
very broad, and probably BBC FEATURES and EDITORIALS might require a more fine-
grained analysis. It might also be the case that some genres are nested in others (we saw 
that instructions can be nested into FEATURE ARTICLES), but, as already stressed, I do not 
perform a thorough zero-to-multi-genre evaluation in this thesis. 
It is worth noting once more that the four text types used in this study are hard-coded in 
the model following previous studies, and not extracted automatically, as in Biber’s 
approach. Similarly, their combination to detect genres was mainly derived from 
Chapter 11 - Beyond the Single Label: Towards a Zero-to-Multi-Genre Classification Scheme 
 198
previous studies and proved to be effective. This gives more generality to the model by 
reducing its dependence on a particular corpus. More precisely, this means that on the 
web (represented by the web corpus used in the model) it is possible to automatically 
detect, with reasonably good accuracy, a number of genres (the four BBC genres) 
represented by a small number of web pages (20 web pages per BBC genres). In other 
words, there is no need for a large amount of genre-labelled data (as required by 
supervised classification) to build a reliable automatic genre classification model if 
linguistic insights, derived from previous studies, are provided to make inferences. 
11.3.4.3 Evaluation of Seven Novel Web Genres 
The second hypothesis says that the combination of the first two text types plus a 
combination of other traits, such as layout and functionality tags (see HTML facets in 
Chapter 5), tested with if-then rules, is sufficient to derive the seven web genres 
included in the web corpus. We will also see how the rules for BLOGS, which do not 
encompass any web-related trait, react when the system is rescaled. 
The 7-web-genre collection (described in more detail in Appendix A) contains novel 
genres (BLOGS, ESHOPS, FAQs, FRONT PAGES, LISTINGS, PERSONAL HOME PAGES, and 
SEARCH PAGES), which are wholly dependent on the new medium (a short description of 
these web genres can be found in Appendix D). I selected these seven web genres as 
representatives of “emergent” or “spontaneous” cybergenres (cf. Shepherd and Watters, 
1998) and they are meant to represent genres more dependent on the new medium for 
their identification.  
In the next subsections, I will perform only a partial evaluation of the model. More 
precisely, I will (i) report on the single-genre evaluation, (ii) describe qualitative 
inspections into a zero-to-multi-genre classification scheme, (iii) use predictions as 
evaluation metric, and finally (iv) I will test the scalability of model. 
Single-Genre Evaluation 
In order to assess the performance of the inferential model, I compared its classification 
accuracy with the accuracy of standard single-label classifiers.  
Chapter 11 - Beyond the Single Label: Towards a Zero-to-Multi-Genre Classification Scheme 
 199
More precisely, I compared the outcome of the model on a single genre with the SVM 
and Naive Bayes classifiers from the Weka machine learning workbench. SVM and 
Naive Bayes classification models were built using the seven web genres of the 7-web-
genre collection – 200 web pages per web genre, amounting to a total of 1,400 web 
pages – and the frequencies of facets normalized to the page length.  
The stratified cross-validated accuracy returned by these classifiers for seed 1 is about 
89% for SVM, and about 67% for Naïve Bayes. The accuracy achieved by the 
inferential model is about 86% (see Table 42).

TOTAL about 89% about 67% about 86% 
Table 42 . Accuracies of standard classifiers and accuracy of the inferential model 
The SVM classifier was run also with a reduced number of attributes, namely 23 
attributes automatically selected by CfsSubsetEval84, with an accuracy of 85%.  
The accuracy of 86% returned by the inferential model is a good achievement for a first 
implementation, especially if we consider that the standard Naïve Bayes classifier 
returns an accuracy of about 67%. Although SVM achieves an accuracy of about 89%, 
i.e. about +3% than the inferential model, it is worth stressing that both Naive Bayes 
and SVM standard classifiers were run on 1,400 web pages, i.e. they were built only on 
the 7-web-collection. The inferential model, on the other hand, is built on a corpus of 
                                                 
84 “CfsSubsetEval assesses the predictive ability of each attribute individually and the degree of 
redundancy among them, preferring sets of attributes that are highly correlated with the class but have 
low intercorrelation”, Witten and Frank (2005: 422). 
Chapter 11 - Beyond the Single Label: Towards a Zero-to-Multi-Genre Classification Scheme 
 200
2,480 web pages. This means that the inferential model can stand a certain level of 
noise, represented by web pages that have not been classified by genre. 
In order to see to what extent a supervised classifier can handle the unclassified web 
pages that might be found on the web, I built an ‘unknown’ class, i.e. a class that 
collects all the genres not included in the 7-web-genre palette. This means that I built an 
SVM classifier with the 2,480 web pages of the web corpus and labelled as DONTKNOW 
all the web pages belonging to the BBC collection and the SPIRIT collection, i.e. 1,080 
web pages.  
The stratified cross-validated accuracy (seed 1) is about 76%, i.e. about –13% of the 
accuracy achieved with a corpus of 1,400 web pages. Figure 58 shows the confusion 
matrix of the accuracy on 2,480 web pages with eight classes. The class DONTKNOW 
(column ‘h’) causes many misclassifications. This confirms the observation made by 
Shepherd et al. (2004) that the introduction of noise – in this case, unclassified web 
pages – significantly decreases the accuracy of the classifier.

Chapter 11 - Beyond the Single Label: Towards a Zero-to-Multi-Genre Classification Scheme 
 201
In this respect, the inferential model appears to be much more accurate and stable than 
the supervised model, returning an accuracy of ca 86% on 2,480 web pages, i.e. about 
+10% more than the model built with SVM on eight classes. 
Qualitative Inspection to Evaluate the Zero-to-Multi-Genre Classification Scheme 
In the previous subsection I showed that the inferential model performs better than an 
SVM classifier when using the same number of web pages. But the inferential model 
can offer more than a simple single-label classification. More precisely, it can perform 
zero-to-multi-genre assignments. In this subsection, I will qualitatively inspect a few 
web pages to exemplify the zero-to-multi genre classification scheme implemented by 
the model, deferring to further research a proper evaluation metric. 
In addition to the assignment of a single genre to a web page like the one shown in 
Figure 59, for which the model has returned the classification shown in Table 43, other 
genre assignments are possible.

Table 44. Snippet from the output: multi-genre assignment 
The web page shown in Figure 60 (already shown in Figure 38 in Chapter 9 as an 
example of genre hybridism) is a BLOG but it also contains sequences of steps akin to 
HOW-TOS or instructional FAQS85. The fragment of the web page shown in Figure 60 
can be seen as an example of genre colonization (cf. Beghtol, 2001), where the 
vocabulary and text forms of one genre (the FAQs genre in this case) are inserted into 
the BLOG genre. These strategies are frequent on the web and might give rise to new 
independent web genres.

85 In Chapter 9, I suggested that the web page shown in Figure 60 could be seen as a HOW-TO nested into 
a BLOG. HOW-TOS are not included in the 7-web-genre palette. However, HOW-TOS and instructional 
FAQS can be considered as similar genres: they are often organized in sequential steps; they often deliver 
information in the form of ‘questions’ and ‘answers’, and so on.  
Chapter 11 - Beyond the Single Label: Towards a Zero-to-Multi-Genre Classification Scheme 
 203
The model also captures a situation where the genre labels available are not suitable for 
the web page under analysis, like the web page in Figure 61, classified as shown in 
Table 45.

Figure 61. Example of a web page without a genre: SPRT_010_049_112_0055685 
If the pattern shown in Figure 61 keeps on recurring when more web genres are added 
to the model, a possible interpretation could be that this pattern might develop into a 
stable web genre in future. If this happens, the system will be ready to host such a 
novelty.  
It is also interesting to compare the multi-label assignment performed by web users in 
the study reported in Chapter 8 with the multi-label assignment performed by the 
inferential model. Unfortunately, fair comparison is not possible because the genre 
palette used for the user study is different from the genre palette included in the 
inferential model. In other words, while the web users had 21 genre labels available, the 
Chapter 11 - Beyond the Single Label: Towards a Zero-to-Multi-Genre Classification Scheme 
 204
inferential model has only seven. However, it is possible to have an idea by comparing 
the classifications of the two web pages shown in Figure 62.

 205
Both users and model mostly agree in classifying the web page on the LHS of Figure 62 
as a SEARCH PAGE and a kind of HOME PAGE. Therefore the model does not seem to 
deviate too far from a human assessment. 
The classification of the web page on the RHS of Figure 62 appears more problematic. 
The model returns the classification shown in Table 47.

Web users were much more uncertain about this page:

• 23 users chose SITEMAP. 
• 11 users chose TUTORIAL.

• 3 users chose PERSONAL HOME PAGE. 
• 2 users selected EZINE. 
• 2 chose FRONT PAGE. 
• 1 thought it was a HOW-TO. 
(data taken Table 3, Chapter 8) 
 
Both the majority of users and the model agree in classifying the web page on the RHS 
of Figure 62 as a kind of LISTING. Users could choose between SITEMAP and HOTLIST. 
Many also added INDEX as a label. The model had only the LISTING label available that 
covers both SITEMAP and HOTLIST. For the rest, it seems that there is a wide oscillation 
in the selection of the labels by the web users, who appear definitely disoriented when

they have to classify this web page. The same disorientation is shown by the model, 
which classifies this web page as ESHOP and PHP. 
Predictions 
In this section I compare the precision of predictions made with the inferential model 
with the two supervised models built in Chapter 10, the 7-web-genre models and the KI-
04 models. This comparison can be done on only one genre, i.e. the ESHOP genre, 
because this is the only genre in common among the three collections. The number of 
guesses is shown in Table 48.

Table 48. Predictions on the eshop genre 
The identification of the ESHOP genre in the 1,000 web pages of the SPIRIT collection is 
higher with the inferential model. While with the supervised models the threshold was 
set to an agreement on probability score of >=0.9, the threshold of the inferential model 
is based on the number of positive rules satisfied. For the results reported in Table 48 
the threshold was the satisfaction of seven positive rules out of seven (cf. Subsection 
11.3.3). 
Spreadsheets containing the list of web pages and my assessment are available online 
and on the CD included in this thesis.  
Scalability 
Broadly speaking, scalability refers to the ability of an application to continue to 
function well when it is re-scaled to a larger size. The scalability of the inferential 
model can have several aspects, such as the enlargement of the corpus and the increase 
of the number of genres. In the current implementation, I tested the former aspect, 
simulating the increase in size of the web. The uncontrolled and fast growth of the web 
Chapter 11 - Beyond the Single Label: Towards a Zero-to-Multi-Genre Classification Scheme 
 207
is often pointed out by researchers (e.g. cf. Kilgarriff and Grefenstette, 2003) but so far 
nobody has tried to re-scale a genre model.  
In order to test whether the inferential model was robust enough to bear an increase in 
size of the web corpus (which, it should be remembered, represents the web), I merged 
the web corpus made of 2,480 web pages described in Subsection 11.3.1 with the KI-04 
corpus, made of 1,205 web pages (Appendix A). The resulting corpus then contains 
3,685 web pages. This means that the corpus has been enlarged by about 35% and that 
z-scores and inferential process are based on 3,685 web pages instead of 2,480 web 
pages. For the rest, the model remains unchanged. 
Accuracy results achieved by the inferential model with the scaled web corpus on 
single-label classification are shown in Table 49. The second column in this table shows 
the accuracies on the initial web corpus (cf. also Table 42), while the third column 
indicates the accuracies with the scaled web corpus.  
The accuracy achieved with the enlarged web corpus is only about –5% (86% vs. 81%). 
This decrease in accuracy is statistically significant (chi-square test of significance), but 
quite small if we consider that the corpus has been increased by about 35%. It is worth 
noting that only one web genre was drastically affected by the re-scaling, namely the 
BLOG genre. This is because the rules for BLOGS (Box 4) are very few and do not include 
any web-related trait. Presumably, adding one or more rules relating to functionality or 
layout would increase BLOG accuracy, without upsetting the system. In fact, if accuracy 
results are compared excluding BLOGS, the basic inferential model achieves an overall 
accuracy of about 84.6%, and the rescaled inferential model returns an accuracy of 
about 82.6%. This means that the difference between the two versions is only 2.2%. 
Overall, then, the inferential model appears stable and robust to rescaling.

The merging of the KI-04 corpus and my web corpus in the inferential model permits 
another interesting comparison, i.e. the comparison of the accuracies on the genre in 
common between the two corpora, i.e. the ESHOP genre.  
This means that I can use the existing rules in the model for ESHOP to identify the SHOP 
genre included in the KI-04 corpus. Accuracy achieved by the inferential model on the 
KI-04 SHOP genre is shown in Table 50 together with the accuracy achieved by Meyer 
zu Eissen and Stein (2004) on the same genre.

The overall accuracy is similar (the difference in favour of the inferential model, i.e. 
about +4%, is statistically not significant (chi-square test of significance).  
The KI-04 SHOP genre from the corpus acts as a kind of test set for the inferential 
model. More precisely, the inferential process has been built on the web corpus (2,480 
web pages), then the model is tested on a genre not belonging to the initial corpus, but 
to an external collection. The accuracy on this genre is stable, as shown in Table 50.  
It is also important to note that, without changing anything in the model (nor the 
Bayesian inference, or if-then rules) the discrimination of KI-04 SHOPS against other 
Chapter 11 - Beyond the Single Label: Towards a Zero-to-Multi-Genre Classification Scheme 
 209
genres is also stable. In particular, the discrimination is very good against BLOGS, as 
shown in Table 51:

Discussion 
As stated at the beginning of the chapter, this model has been built to face the open web 
and not a closed-world situation with a predictable population of genres. The web 
corpus on which the inferential model is based should represent a situation similar to the 
open web. 
In these conditions, the accuracy of the inferential model on a single label is competitive 
with the accuracy of standard classifiers. More precisely, the accuracy of a standard 
classifier, like SVM, is higher than the accuracy achieved with the inferential model 
when only a restricted number of web genres are included in the supervised model (see 
Table 42). It deteriorates when the class DONTKNOW, that contains all the genres not 
included in the 7-web-genre palette, is added to the classification model (see Figure 58).  
Chapter 11 - Beyond the Single Label: Towards a Zero-to-Multi-Genre Classification Scheme 
 210
Although at this stage of research it is not possible to perform a comprehensive 
evaluation of the inferential model, the zero-to-multi-label classification scheme has 
been qualitatively inspected and appears to be effective. 
The number of correct predictions on an arbitrary collection, like the SPIRIT collection, 
is higher than the predictions suggested by the supervised models discussed in Chapter 
10. This potential can result very fruitful in future to explore the open web.  
The model appears to be scalable in size. It remains basically stable and robust on the 
accuracy of the 7-web-genre palette and accurate when tested on a genre, SHOPS, 
coming from an alien collection, such as the KI-04 collection. 
The main advantage of the model is that it exploits linguistic insights that give 
generality and stability to the approach, and make it more corpus-independent. While 
standard classifiers act mostly like black boxes, where it is often hard to decode how 
linguistic knowledge is handled by the mathematical algorithm, with the inferential 
model linguistic insights are coded as facets – i.e. functionally interpreted features – and 
universal text types, and implemented in a very straightforward algorithm.  
The inferential approach is implemented in a computational model that is purposely 
very simple. This computational simplicity should help better understand the validity of 
the theoretical stance. However, the possibility of replacing hand-crafted rules with 
some learning methodology can be explored in the near future. Interesting hints come 
from experiments with incremental learning (cf. Segal and Kephart, 2000) and adaptive 
learning (cf. the Workshop on Adaptive Text Extraction and Mining 88).  
Unlike standard classifiers for which the learned models are often too tailored to a 
predictable population, the inferential model can be applied to any arbitrary web page to 
identify the possible presence or absence of the text types and genres included in the 
model.

One could argue that in a standard classifier text types are implicitly learned from the 
features and directly mapped into a genre, without the need for any middle layer. 
Unfortunately, the mapping between surface cues and genres is never unique or 
unambiguous. A relatively small number of linguistic combinations serve to represent 
many different types of text. With the inferential model the effort is concentrated on the 
reconstructions of the context of communication (i.e. text type identification) and on the 
format (mainly layout and functionality). 
Finally, it is important to stress that although text types are hard-coded in the model, 
there is no manual annotation of web pages by genre. Web pages were randomly 
downloaded from genre-specific portals or archives following the principle of 
annotation by objective sources (cf. Chapter 10). Web pages were parsed using a tagger-
parser, and linguistic features and facets were automatically extracted and counted from 
the parsed outputs, while frequencies of HTML tags were automatically counted from 
the raw web pages.  
This model is capable of capturing genre hybridism and individualisation through zero-
genre and multi-genre labelling. In the next section I will show how the inferential 
model represents an implementable characterization of genre in web pages. 
11.4 Towards an Implementable Characterization of Genre 
In Chapter 9, I suggested including the two attributes of genre hybridism and 
individualisation in the characterization of genre in web pages. In the previous sections 
of this chapter I presented a model that is capable of capturing genre hybridism and 
individualisation through a zero-to-multi genre classification scheme.  
More precisely, the model implements the tuple shown in Box 7: 
(genre(s) of a) web page=<linguistic features, HTML, text types, [...]> 
 
Box 7. Tuple representing the characterization of genre in web pages 
Chapter 11 - Beyond the Single Label: Towards a Zero-to-Multi-Genre Classification Scheme 
 212
In this tuple the use of round brackets indicates optional elements, and angular brackets 
enclose the attributes. This tuple means that web pages can have zero, one or more 
genres ((genre(s) of) web pages) and that this situation can be captured by a 
number of attributes. For the time being these attributes are limited to linguistic 
features, HTML tags, text types, but in future other attributes can be added 
([...]).  
The attributes of the tuple can capture the presence of textual conventions or their 
absence. The presence of conventions brings about expectations, and these can be used 
to identify one genre or multiple genres. The absence of conventions can be interpreted 
in terms of individualisation. Broadly speaking, when several genres are present in a 
web page, I refer to this phenomenon as ‘genre hybridism; when no acknowledged 
genre can be assigned to a web page, I talk about ‘individualisation’ (cf. Chapter 9). 
The attributes <linguistic features, HTML tags, text types> of the tuple 
represent the computationally-tractable version of the combination <purpose, form> 
often used to define the concept of genre (e.g. cf. Roussinov et al., 2001).  
Text types, i.e. the rhetorical patterns that indicate the purpose of communication or, in 
other words, what a text has been written for. For example, a text can be produced to 
narrate, instruct, argue, etc; NARRATION, INSTRUCTION, and ARGUMENTATION are examples 
of text types.  
Form is a more heterogeneous attribute. Form can refer to linguistic form and to the 
shape (layout, etc.; cf. Dillon and Vaughan, 1997). From an automatic point of view, 
linguistic form is represented by linguistic features, while shape is represented by 
HTML tags. Also the functionality attribute introduced by Shepherd and Watters (1998) 
can be seen in terms of HTML tags (e.g. tags for links and scripts).  
As already pointed out, text types should thus be seen as a kind of ‘processed’ or 
‘higher order’ feature. As genre is a complex concept, and genres cannot be easily 
characterized by an unambiguous set of surface cues, text types represent a middle layer 
Chapter 11 - Beyond the Single Label: Towards a Zero-to-Multi-Genre Classification Scheme 
 213
that gives flexibility to an automatic genre classification system, enabling zero-, one- 
and multi-genre identification: 
• a single-genre assignment can be made when a web page shows a distribution of 
text types and additional traits that can be uniquely ascribed to a single genre, like 
Figure 59 that has been identified as an ESHOP. 
• A zero-genre assignment is possible when the distribution or combination of text 
types and/or additional traits is unexpected or too hybrid, and cannot be safely 
ascribed to any acknowledged genre, like the web page shown in Figure 61. 
• Finally, a multi-genre assignment can be made when a web page shows a 
distribution or combination of text types and/or additional traits that is shared by 
several genres, like the one shown in Figure 60, which has been assigned to both 
BLOG and FAQS.  
 
In the next section I will draw some conclusions about the empirical and theoretical 
findings presented in this chapter. 
11.5 Conclusion 
This chapter described a new method for automatic genre identification that implements 
a zero-to-multi-genre classification scheme, i.e. a scheme that in addition to the standard 
identification of a single genre also encompasses the assignment of zero or multiple 
genre labels. This method is based on a model that has two main characteristics, namely 
separation of the concepts of ‘text types’ and ‘genres’, and the reliance on Bayesian 
inference and not on supervised learning.  
The basic assumption behind the model is that the analysis of genres in terms of text 
types allows us to go beyond single-genre assignment, because such an analysis remains 
possible even if web pages do not show any acknowledged genre, or if they show 
several genres at the same time. As such, this model has also the potential of providing 
useful information about emerging genres or difficult web pages, and unveiling the 
relations of genres to one another.  
In this model, hard-coded combinations of facets represent text types within a modified 
form of Bayesian theorem already used in artificial intelligence for inferential 
reasoning, the odds-likelihood or subjective Bayesian method. The inferred text types 
Chapter 11 - Beyond the Single Label: Towards a Zero-to-Multi-Genre Classification Scheme 
 214
are combined together with additional traits by hard-coded if-then rules in order to 
derive genres. Many linguistic insights from previous qualitative and quantitative 
studies are hard-coded into the model. In this way the model gains in generality and 
appears to be less corpus-dependent. It achieves a competitive accuracy on single-label 
evaluation, returns a higher number of correct predictions and, above all, proves to be 
robust when the corpus is re-scaled to a larger size. From qualitative inspections, it 
appears that it can perform a zero-genre assignment and a multi-genre assignment. 
Zero-label and multi-label assignments account for the two attributes of 
individualisation and genre hybridism that I proposed including in the characterization 
of genre in web pages. 
In this respect, this model represents a first step towards an implementable 
characterization of genres in web pages. This characterization is implemented by a tuple 
containing automatically extractable attributes, whose number can be increased in 
future.  
In conclusion, the inferential model presented in this chapter is a simple starting point 
towards a more dynamic view of a genre classification system, and tries to handle some 
of the complex issues connected with the identification of genres in the open web.

Chapter 12.  Conclusion 
In this thesis I have argued that automatic identification of genres in web pages needs a 
more flexible genre classification scheme, i.e. a scheme capable of assigning zero, one 
or multiple genre labels to a web page. I have presented a series of empirical studies that 
investigated why a zero-to-multi genre classification scheme would be more appropriate 
for classifying web pages, and explored to what extent it is possible to implement such a 
scheme into an automatic system. The results of these investigations provide a series of 
theoretical, experimental, and methodological contributions to the understanding of how 
genres are instantiated on the web, and to the development of automatic methods for 
genre identification in web pages. In short: 
• Zero-to-multi-genre labelling better represents the users’ perspective and is 
potentially useful for the characterization of emerging genres (Section 12.1.1). 
 
• POS trigrams and facets expand the range of automatically-extractable genre-
revealing features, and contribute towards a more flexible automatic genre 
identification. With supervised single-label classifiers, they achieve a competitive 
accuracy of about 88-89%, against an accuracy of about 90% reached by traditional 
features, like function words and POS tags (Section 12.1.2). 
 
• The inferential approach, proposed in this thesis as an alternative to traditional 
single-label supervised genre classification, implements the zero-to-multi-genre 
classification scheme with promising results. It performs competitively on single-
label genre classification – 86% vs. 76% achieved by a SVM classifier – and proves 
robust to scalability (Section 12.1.3). 
 
The following is a summary of the main findings and directions for future research. 
12.1  Main Findings 
In Chapter 1, I have advanced three main claims. The first is that the identification of 
genres on the web is affected by the complexity of web pages, and by the fluidity and 
fast-paced evolution of the web. The second is that automatic genre identification can 
benefit from automatically-extractable features returned by NLP tools. The third is that 
Chapter 12 - Conclusions 
 217
linguistic insights can contribute to a flexible genre classification scheme. The main 
body of the thesis describes a series of experiments that support these claims, as 
summarized below. 
12.1.1  Influence of Web Page Complexity and Fast Web Evolution 
on Genre Identification 
The study reported in Chapter 8 and based on 135 web users reveals that: 
• 20 out of 25 web pages are labelled using at least three genre labels (see Section 
8.2.3.2); 
 
• when genre conventions are weak or unclear, web users tend to disagree more, and 
this results in the use of a larger number of genre labels (see Table 8, Section 
8.2.3.2).  
 
These findings indicate that: 
• multi-genre labelling is more representative of users’ perspective on genres of web; 
 
• zero-genre label may be useful to signal the uncertainty or fragmentation of genre 
assignment.  
 
The experiments described in Chapter 7, which focus on the automatic identification of 
emerging genres, lead to a similar conclusion. The results of these experiments show 
that: 
• two emerging textual patterns, that I called ‘contact web pages’ and ‘fast-effective 
information delivery’ (see Section 7.3.1), could be detected.  
 
However, the relations of these patterns with existing and acknowledged genres remain 
unspecified. The detection of these relations could be a way of classifying emerging 
genres with respect to existing categories. As in the case of users’ perspective on genres 
of web pages, emerging genres too would benefit from zero- or multi-labelling: 
• a zero-genre label would indicate that an emerging pattern has no clear relation with 
existing genres, and is characterized by a high degree of individualisation;  
 
• multiple genre labels would suggest that an emerging pattern is hybrid, i.e. it draws 
from several existing genres.  
 
Chapter 12 - Conclusions 
 218
These observations motivated my proposal that the attributes of genre hybridism and 
individualisation should be included in the characterization of genres of web pages 
(Chapter 9). These attributes bring two benefits:  
• they contribute to a refinement of the characterization of genres of web pages; 
 
• they help pinpoint the range of flexibility that an automatic classification system for 
web pages should have. More specifically, genre hybridism accounts for multi-genre 
classification, whereas individualisation accounts for zero-genre classification. 
12.1.2  Advantages of Using NLP Tools 
Several experiments in this thesis have focussed on expanding automatically-extractable 
genre-revealing features by utilizing the output of a tagger-parser. First, I have pointed 
out some inherent limitations of NLP tools applied to web pages (Chapter 3). Second, I 
have borrowed shallow syntactic features from stylometry – the POS trigrams – and 
applied them to genre discrimination (Chapter 4). Finally, I have introduced the facets, 
which enhance and extend the features proposed by Biber (1988) by including syntactic 
patterns, HTML tags and other attributes (Chapter 5). The main findings on features 
reveal the following: 
• The use of POS trigrams, based on the morphological annotation returned by a 
tagger, is effective, whether applied to a traditional corpus like the BNC or to web 
page collections. In both cases, accuracy is very high (between 80% and 90%) (see 
Sections 4.3.1. and 10.3.5). However, POS trigrams have some drawbacks, such as 
corpus-dependence and subjective thresholding (Chapter 6). Moreover, they are 
linguistically opaque and do not provide any intuitive textual insight. 
 
• Facets, based on the output returned by a tagger-parser, prove effective for 
supervised classification. They reach accuracy results between 83% and 89%. 
Further, they provide a linguistic and textual interpretation that can be exploited for 
implementing a more flexible classification system (like the inferential model 
implemented in Chapter 11). They are corpus-independent and encode previous 
linguistic knowledge.  
 
It is important to stress that it is beneficial to have several types of genre-revealing 
feature, each type showing different characteristics. The three feature sets used in this 
thesis (1_set based on function words and POS; 2_set based on POS trigams; and 3_set 
Chapter 12 - Conclusions 
 219
based on facets) offer differing views on the same data, and this potential has been 
exploited for predictive tasks (Chapter 10). 
12.1.3  The Contribution of Linguistic Insights to a Flexible Genre 
Classification Scheme  
In order to achieve a more flexible genre classification scheme (zero-to-multi genre 
classification) I have investigated two different approaches to automatic genre 
identification in web pages: (a) the supervised approach and (b) the inferential 
approach.  
Supervised approach. The main advantage of the supervised approach (Chapter 10) is 
that an outstanding accuracy of about 90% on a single genre label can be reached in a 
closed and static situation with an ideal combination of the following elements:  
• a predictable population;  
• a felicitous genre palette, i.e. a corpus of seven disparate web genres with similar 
levels of granularity and annotation by the criterion of external sources;  
• mixed feature sets, i.e. the three feature sets used in the experiments all contain 
lexical items, linguistic tags, punctuation, HTML tags and genre-specific words;  
• a balanced corpus, i.e. 200 web pages per web genre;  
• a state-of-the-art classification algorithm, namely SVM as implemented in Weka;  
• prototypical web pages, i.e. web pages selected complying to prototype theory.  
 
The main disadvantage of this approach is that it has a reduced generality and 
exportability (predictions on the SPIRIT sample are sparse), and depends heavily on the 
above-listed attributes.  
In conclusion, this approach proves mostly inadequate to handle the complexity of web 
pages and the fluidity and the fast-paced evolution of the web. In other words, the range 
of flexibility of standard supervised classification algorithms does not progress beyond 
the assumption that a web page can be assigned to only a single acknowledged genre. 
Inferential approach. The inferential approach (Chapter 11) exploits an original 
combination of findings from several fields. It is based on the feature set of facets 
Chapter 12 - Conclusions 
 220
described in Chapter 5, and relies on the detection of text types as an intermediate step. 
It offers several advantages (see Section 11.3.4.3):  
• It has a competitive accuracy on single-genre classification. More precisely: 
 
 the accuracy of a standard SVM classifier is about 90% and the accuracy 
achieved with the inferential model is 86% when the supervised model is 
built with a restricted number of web genres and web pages (i.e. those 
included in the 7-web-genre collection (see Section 10.3.1);  
 the accuracy of a standard SVM classifier deteriorates to about 76% and the 
accuracy achieved with the inferential model remains 86% when the 
supervised model is built with the same corpus as the inferential model (i.e. 
the web corpus of 2,480 web pages (see Section 11.3.1).  
 
• It is more exportable than supervised models to a corpus characterized by an 
arbitrary population (the SPIRIT sample), and returns a higher number of correct 
predictions.  
 
• It proves stable, showing a decrease in accuracy of only –5% when the corpus on 
which it is based upon is rescaled to a larger size (+35%). 
 
• It does not require any manual annotation of web pages by genres (an operation that 
is expensive and time-consuming), because it is not based on the learning from pre-
labelled examples but on the inference from general linguistic insights.  
 
• It is capable of capturing the two attributes of genre hybridism and individualisation 
(proposed in Chapter 9) through the zero-to-multi genre classification scheme. 
 
• The use of text types, as an intermediate step between features (or better, facets) and 
genres, creates a network of relations between existing genres, and allows textual 
analysis even when a genre is still emerging or when a web page cannot be readily 
assigned to an existing genre.  
 
The main disadvantage of this approach is that it cannot be fully evaluated for zero-
genre and multi-genre labelling, owing to limitations in the current state of genre 
research; consequently, I have offered only qualitative inspections on a few web pages. 
This limitation is the object of future work.  
12.1.4  Contributions of the Thesis 
The experimental results, findings, methodological choices and theoretical observations 
of this thesis contribute to automatic genre identification and genre analysis, as well as 
to textlinguistics and corpus linguistics. 
Chapter 12 - Conclusions 
 221
The main original contribution is to automatic genre identification research. The 
inferential model presented in Chapter 11 shows that it is possible to implement a zero-
to-multi-genre classification scheme that accounts for the open web, populated by 
difficult or multi-genre web pages. This simple model, borrowed from artificial 
intelligence and based on linguistic insights, progresses beyond the simplifying 
assumption, underlying previous empirical genre studies, that a web page can be 
assigned only to a single acknowledged genre. This model combines in an original way 
the classificatory and the descriptive frameworks summarized in Biber (1994: 37-39). It 
merges several traditions by incorporating findings from different fields, namely 
automatic genre classification, textlinguistics, corpus linguistics, genre analysis, and 
artificial intelligence, and offers a more articulated view of genres in web pages. 
Another original contribution is to genre theory, in particular to the analysis of digital 
genres. The specification of the concept of emerging genres, and the identification of 
the two attributes of genre hybridism and individualisation, contribute to the ongoing 
discussion on genres of digital documents. 
Last but not least, the findings of thesis are useful for textlinguistics and corpus 
linguistics. In the first place, they confirm that qualitative and quantitative analyses can 
be successfully combined, as already shown by Biber following the completely different 
approach of multi-dimensional analysis. More importantly, this combination of 
approaches has the potential to provide empirical backing for the intuitive claims of 
textlinguists (e.g., Werlich’s intuition about the predominance of text types in genre), 
providing at the same time empirical data for text type and genre analyses.  
12.2  Directions for Further Research 
The creation of a hospitable genre classification system. A ‘hospitable’ system is one 
that is capable of hosting new genres, or updating existing ones, without losing its 
existing functionality . This problem has already been identified by Kwasnik, Crowston 
and co-workers, who suggest using facet analysis to obtain a more flexible classification 
model that is “expressive and hospitable to new genre types and genre combination” 
Chapter 12 - Conclusions 
 222
(Kwasnik et al., 2001; cf. also Crowston and Kwasnik, 2004). It has also been 
highlighted by Shepherd, Watters and co-workers, who suggest applying machine 
learning to the development of “adaptive models that will classify web pages according 
to genre and will identify new genre as they emerge” (Shepherd et al., 2004). However, 
the multi-facetted model capable of hosting new genres, and the adaptive learning 
system that can identify genre as they emerge, have not been implemented yet, and no 
computational or statistical solutions have been publicly proposed. The multi-facetted 
approach based on machine learning implemented by Kessler et al. (1997) does not 
show how a new genre can fit smoothly into an existing system, without readjusting the 
whole system. A possible starting point of this line of research could be the inclusion of 
a larger number of genres and text types into the inferential model presented in Chapter 
11, thus testing its robustness, its hospitability, and its potential effectiveness in the 
detection of emerging genres. An alternative to this proposal could be the already 
mentioned incremental model proposed by Segal and Kephart (2000) to a genre palette. 
The creation of a genre-annotated reference corpus for evaluation purposes. As 
pointed out several times in this thesis, genre studies have been held back through the 
absence of a reference corpus. Without such a corpus it is difficult to assess how the 
performance of classification algorithms is influenced by issues like corpus size and the 
number and the distribution of genre classes. However, building a genre-annotated 
reference corpus of web pages is arduous for a number of reasons: 
• In what form can a web page be included in a corpus? In a HTML version or in a 
text-only version? Including images or leaving them out? We saw in Chapter 3 that 
some text can be coded as image. Similar issues are the object of the recent 
CLEANEVAL initiative89, co-ordinated by M. Baroni, A. Kilgarriff and S. Sharoff. 
 
• What criteria should be followed when annotating a web page according to a zero-
to-multi genre classification scheme? Should multiple genres be rated?  
 
• What criteria should be followed for evaluating emerging genres? 
 
• To my knowledge, no standard zero-to-multi-label evaluation metric exists. 
However, some multi-label evaluation measures are already available (cf. Schapire 
                                                 
89 Cf. <http://www.uib.no/mailman/public/corpora/2006-July/002920.html>. 
Chapter 12 - Conclusions 
 223
and Singer, 1999, 2000; Brinker et al., 2006). Can these metrics be smoothly 
adapted to handle zero-to-multi-genre identification? 
 
The implementation of genre-based search engines. There are several projects in 
progress aiming to develop genre-based search engines (e.g. Shepherd et al., 2004; 
Meyer zu Eissen and Stein, 2004; Rehm, 2005). However, these experiments are 
mentioned only in passing, and results are not publicly available. A simple prototype, 
DropJaw, was implemented and tested by Karlgren et al. (1998), but although initial 
results were promising, no further developments or more advanced implementations are 
known. There is a widespread belief that genre can be integrated with topic in existing 
search engines, but without further investigation it is not clear whether this can be 
achieved in an effective working system.  
Text Types and Genres for Sentiment Analysis. Much automatic sentiment-analysis 
research focusses on identifying affect-bearing words (e.g. cf. Wiebe, 2000; Turney and 
Littman, 2003; Riloff et al., 2003). While the identification of these words is essential to 
automatic sentiment analysis, a useful area of research would be to integrate the use of 
lexical hints with text type and genre analysis. For instance, opinions and speculations 
are often expressed using rhetorical/discourse patterns like ARGUMENTATION or 
PERSUASION. Similarly, emotion and sentiment are frequently revealed in BLOGS or 
FORA. The identification of text types and genres that are more likely to contain 
opinions and emotions would filter out uninteresting documents, like those containing 
instructions or informational text. 
12.3  Final Remark 
In this thesis I have argued for a more flexible approach to automatic identification of 
genre in web pages. I have proposed a solution that relies on the inclusion of linguistic 
and textual insights provided by previous theoretical and empirical studies in a simple 
computational model. Other solutions are possible that emphasise other aspects. My 
greatest reward would be to have contributed to the discussion on genre.

Appendix A.  Web Page Collections 
This appendix describes the four web page collections utilized in the experiments 
described in the thesis. These collections have been assembled for different purposes 
using different criteria. These criteria will be briefly summarized in the following 
sections. The four web page collections are available for download at 
<http://www.nltg.brighton.ac.uk/home/Marina.Santini/>, and include (1) the small BBC 
web genre collection, (2) the 7-web-genre collection, (3) the SPIRIT collection, and (4) 
the KI-04 corpus. 
The BBC Web Genre Collection 
The BBC web genre collection includes traditional genres adapted to the functionality 
of the web. Following Shepherd and Watters’ (1998) taxonomy, the web genres 
contained in this collection are “extant” and “variant” cybergenres, i.e. they are based 
on existing genres but “have evolved by exploiting the capabilities afforded by the new 
medium”. I use this collection in Chapter 11 to test the inferential model.  
This collection includes 20 EDITORIALS, 20 DO-IT-YOURSELF (DIY) MINI-GUIDES, 20 
SHORT BIOGRAPHIES, and 20 FEATURE ARTICLES (see List 2). These web genres are 
briefly described in Appendix D. 
1) EDITORIALS 3) SHORT BIOGRAPHIES 
2) DIY MINI-GUIDES 4) FEATURE ARTICLES 
 
List 2. List of web genres included in the BBC collection 
The web pages included in this collection were downloaded during early spring 2005 
and annotated by the two criteria of annotation by objective sources and consistent level 
of granularity (see Chapter 10). The BBC web genre collection contains web pages 
downloaded from the BBC website (<http://www.bbc.co.uk>). More precisely, the four 
web genres have been downloaded from the genre-specific archives listed in Table 55:

Table 55. BBC genre-specific archives 
The 7-Web-Genre Collection 
I have personally built the 7-web-genre collection, which includes novel genres, i.e. 
genres that fully exploit the functionality of the web. Following Shepherd and Watters’ 
(1998) taxonomy, the web genres contained in this collection are “novel” (either 
“emergent” or “spontaneous”) cybergenres, in the sense that they are “wholly dependent 
on the new medium”. I use this collection in Chapter 5, Chapter 10, and Chapter 11.  
This collection includes 200 BLOGS, 200 ESHOPS, 200 FAQS, 200 NEWSPAPER FRONT 
PAGES, 200 LISTINGS, 200 PERSONAL HOME PAGES, and 200 SEARCH PAGES (see List 3). 
These web genres are briefly described in Appendix D. 
1) BLOGS 5) LISTINGS 
2) ESHOPS 6) PERSONAL HOME PAGES (PHPS)  
3) FAQS 7) SEARCH PAGES 
4) ONLINE FRONT PAGES  
 
List 3. List of web genres included in the 7-web-page collection 
The web pages included in this collection were downloaded during early spring 2005 
and annotated by the two criteria of annotation by objective sources and consistent level 
of granularity. For experimental purposes, I included in this collection a super-genre – 
the LISTING super-genre – encompassing several genres at basic level. More precisely, 
the LISTING super-genre includes four kinds of lists: HOTLISTS, SITEMAPS, TABLES OF 
CONTENTS, and CHECKLISTS. The effect of encompassing a super-genre in a genre 
palette containing a different genre granularity (i.e. genres at the basic level) is 
described in Chapter 10. 
Appendix A - Web Page Collections 
 245
The web pages included in the 7-web-genre collection were randomly downloaded from 
public archives or portals, or selected when they contained the genre name in the title 
(cf. HOTLIST genre below).  
There are plenty of websites containing collections of BLOGS. The 7-web-page 
collection contains only personal BLOGS downloaded from: 
• <http://www.britblog.com/> 
• <http://www.nataliedarbeloff.com/augustinearchive.html> 
 
 
ESHOPS were downloaded following the links listed in: 
• <http://www.shops.co.uk/> 
• <http://www.eshops.co.uk/> 
 
 
FAQS were randomly selected from: 
• <http://www.cybernothing.org/faqs/net-abuse-faq.html> 
• <http://www.irs.gov/faqs/> 
• <http://www.copyright.gov/help/faq/> 
• <http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/tcfaqHED.html> 
 
 
Online NEWSPAPER FRONT PAGES belong to a number of different online newspapers 
(such as The New York Times, or the Times). I downloaded them through the Internet 
Archive: 
• <www.archive.org> 
 
 
LISTINGS were selected by searching keywords in Google and selecting relevant web 
pages from the results. The web pages representing the LISTING super-genre have one of 
these keywords (and graphical variants) in the main heading: ‘checklist’, ‘hot list’, 
‘table of contents’ and ‘sitemap’ (for example, see Insect Hotlist at 
<http://www.fi.edu/tfi/hotlists/insects.html>, shown in Figure 33, RHS).  
The PERSONAL HOME PAGE is the basic level genre of the super-genre HOME PAGE, which 
has ACADEMIC PERSONAL HOME PAGE, ADMINISTRATIVE PERSONAL HOME PAGE’, etc. as 
subgenres. In the 7-web-page collection, PERSONAL HOME PAGES include academic and 
Appendix A - Web Page Collections 
 246
administrative personal home pages, as well as more informal private personal home 
pages. They were downloaded from the following URLs:

SEARCH PAGES were downloaded from: 
• <http://www.searchenginecolossus.com/> 
The SPIRIT Collection 
The SPIRIT collection90 is a random crawl carried out in 2001 and bootstrapped by a set 
of educational websites (Clarke et al. 2002; Joho and Sanderson, 2004). It contains 
individual web pages and not full websites. The size of the whole collection is about 
one terabyte, and the number of web pages (mostly HTML files) is about 95 millions. It 
is multilingual and without any meta-information, apart from a short header including 
the original URL, the date and time when the pages were crawled from the web, and a 
few details. It represents a genuine slice of the real web ‘frozen’ in a collection for 
research.  
In the experiments described in this thesis, I use only a random sample of 1,000 English 
web pages from the SPIRIT collection. This SPIRIT sample of unclassified web pages 
represents the unknown part of the web or, better, the open web, i.e. a medium still fluid 
and evolving at fast pace, where the population is unknown and web pages might be 
evolving, hybrid, or individualised and not following any genre convention. I use the 
SPIRIT web pages in Chapters 3, 7, 10 and 11. 
                                                 
90 Many thanks to Mark Sanderson for making the SPIRIT collection available for my research. Many 
thanks also to Hideo Joho for his technical assistance with this collection.

The Web Corpus 
The BBC web genre collection, the 7-web-genre collection and the random SPIRIT 
sample have been conflated into the web corpus on which the inferential model 
described in Chapter 11 is based upon.  
The web corpus represents an approximation of the web, i.e. one of the possible 
compositions of a random slice of the web, statistically supported by reliable standard 
error measures. In order to be reliable standard error must be very small. In other words, 
a small value of the standard error indicates greater stability of the results. As shown in 
Table 56, the web corpus has very small standard error measures.

Table 56. Standard error measures of the web corpus 
The KI-04 Corpus 
The KI-04 corpus91 was built following a palette of eight genres suggested by a user 
study on genre usefulness (Meyer zu Eissen and Stein, 2004). It includes 1,295 English 
web pages (HTML documents), but only 800 web pages (100 per genre) were used in 
the experiment described in Meyer zu Eissen and Stein (2004). In the experiments 
described in this thesis, I used 1,205 web pages because some web pages were empty. 
Both the original version (1,295 web pages) and the working version (1,205 web pages) 
are available online at the URL reported at the beginning of this appendix. The KI-04 
corpus includes the eight web genres shown in List 4. 
1. ARTICLE (127 web pages) 5. DISCUSSION (127 web pages) 
2. DOWNLOAD (151 web pages) 6. HELP (139 web pages) 
3. LINK COLLECTION (205 web pages) 7. PORTRAYAL (NON-PRIV) (163 web pages) 
4. PORTRAYAL (PRIV.) (126 web pages) 8. SHOP (167 web pages) 
 
List 4. List of web genres included in the KI-04 corpus 
The KI-04 corpus was collected using bookmarks from about five people. Some genres 
were extended to get a better balance. The corpus was sorted by three people, one of 
whom wrote a bachelor thesis (in German) on the corpus building process. One of the 
                                                 
91 Many thanks to Sven Meyer zu Eissen for making this collection available for my research.

creators (S. Meyer zu Eissen) checked many of the pages, and most of the sorting 
complied with his understanding of the genre categories. The download date was 
January 26th, 2004. The description of the eight web genres included in the KI-04 
corpus shown in Box 8 is taken from Meyer zu Eissen and Stein (2004).  
• ARTICLES. Documents with long passages of text, such as research articles, reviews, 
technical reports, or book chapters. 
• DISCUSSIONS. All pages that provide forums, mailing lists or discussion boards. 
• DOWNLOADS. Pages on which freeware, shareware, demo versions of programs etc. can be 
downloaded. 
• HELPS. All pages that provide assistance, e. g. Q&A or FAQ pages. 
• LINK LISTS. Documents which consist of link lists for the main part. 
• PORTRAYAL (NON-PRIV). Web appearances of companies, universities, and other public 
institutions. I. e., home or entry or portal pages, descriptions of organization and mission, 
annual reports, brochures, contact information, etc. 
• PORTRAYAL (PRIV). Private self-portrayals, i.e. typical private homepages with informal 
content. 
• SHOP. All kinds of pages whose main purpose is product information or sale. 
 
Box 8. Description of the web genres of the KI-04 corpus (from Meyer zu Eissen and Stein, 2004) 
 
It is to be noted that only one web genre of the KI-04 corpus is in common with the 7-
web-genre collection, namely ESHOP/SHOP. According to the description in Box 8, LINK 
LISTS do not overlap with the LISTING super-genre of the 7-web-genre collection. As for 
PORTRAYAL (PRIV) web pages, I am not sure that they entirely correspond to the 
PERSONAL HOME PAGE genre that I included in the 7-web-genre collection. They could 
also include ‘professional profiles’ or ‘CVs’. For this reason, I considered the 
PORTRAYAL (PRIV) genre of the KI-04 corpus different from the PERSONAL HOME PAGE 
genre of the 7-web-genre collection.

Appendix B - Facets in Detail 
 251
 
Appendix B.  Facets in Detail 
This appendix contains a detailed description of the facets introduced in Chapter 5. 
Explanations and examples are provided for linguistic facets (namely, functional cues, 
syntactic patterns and the genre-specific word facets) and HTML facets.  
This appendix is organized as follows: first a brief description of the facet, and its funtional 
interpretation with regard to genres or text types; then a list of the actual tags and/or lexical 
items, accompanied by a legend and/or examples.  
Linguistic Facets: Functional Cues 
Functional cues are listed in Table 7. A breakdown follows. 
Predicators. This facet includes verbs in any roles, from auxiliary to finite or non-finite 
forms, to –ing forms. An extensive use of verbs is usually connected to an interactive and 
affective purpose (Biber, 1988: 105). In particular, verbs are extremely common in 
conversational genres (such as INTERVIEWS or DEBATES), because spoken genres often have a 
high number of short sentences, to keep the listeners' attention alert. Usually the level of 
syntactic complexity is very low since each sentence expresses a single main idea. Verbs are 
also used to show the speaker's attitudes, with elements such as: I think, I know, etc. (Biber et 
al., 1999: 359-360).  
 
@+FAUXV # finite auxiliary predicator  
# Ex: This will cause a soft boot in the emulator. 
 
@-FAUXV # nonfinite auxiliary predicator 
  # Ex: Software can be split roughly into two main types.  
 
@+FMAINV # finite main predicator 
  # Ex: Sockets form the interface between these two components. 
 
Appendix B - Facets in Detail 
 252
@-FMAINV # nonfinite main predicator 
# Ex: If you are running the DOS emulator, go to the main 
window. 
 
@<P-FMAINV" # nonfinite clause as preposition complement 
  # Ex: This mechanism is used for creating a virtual connection. 
 
Complex NPs. The basic structure of the noun-headed phrase includes four major 
components, two of which are optional: determiner + (pre-modification) + head noun + (post-
modification and complementation). Overall, noun phrases with a modifier are relatively rare 
in conversational genres, while they are common in press genres and academic genres (Biber 
et al., 1999: 574 ff.).

Nominals. This facet includes nouns, prepositional phrases, adjectives, appositions, and other 
elements that expand or enrich the meaning expressed by the noun. High frequency of nouns 
indicates density of information (Biber, 1988: 105). Prepositional phrases integrate other 
pieces of information into a text, while adjectives and other elements further elaborate 
nominal information. The nominal component is very high in academic genres (Biber et al., 
1999: 235) and informational texts (Biber, 1988: 104). 
@APP  # Apposition 
  # Ex: John, your brother, came yesterday. 
 
@NH  # Stray noun phrase 
  # Ex: The house beside the church. 
 
@A>  # Premodifier of a nominal 
  # Ex: These sophisticated algorithms are stored safely. 
 
@DN  # Determiner 
  # Ex: The optical laser is a useful tool for eye treatment. 
 
@<NOM-OF # Postmodifying prepositional phrase beginning with "of" 
  # Ex: This will cause a soft boot of the emulator. 
 
@<NOM  # Postmodifier of a nominal 
# Ex: This mechanism is used for creating a connection between  
the two components. 
 
@<P  # Other preposition complement 
  # Ex: This will leave the rest of the system running. 
 
@OBJ  # Object 
  # Ex: This will leave the rest of the system running. 
 
@SUBJ  # Subject 
  # Ex: Software can be split into several categories. 
 
@PCOMPL-S # Subject complement 
  # Ex: Biscuits which are sugar-free, or nearly so. 
 
@PCOMPL-O # Object complement 
  # Ex: This procedure makes the flow transparent to the user. 
 
@QN>  # Premodifying quantifier 
  # Ex: This process takes less than 1000 milliseconds.

@VOC  # Vocative 
  # Ex: Just do it, John! 
 
First person. This facet comprises first person singular and plural pronouns, including 
possessives and reflexives. When there is a high frequency of first person pronouns in a text, 
the communication context appears to be related to the text producer(s) (Werlich, 1976: 135, 
137). First person pronouns are used in all subjective genres such as COMMENTS and 
OPINIONS. 
PRON PERS SG1 # Personal pronouns, singular 
# I, me, myself, my, mine. 
 
PRON PERS PL1 # Personal pronouns, plural 
# we, us, ourselves, our, ours. 
 
Second person. This facet comprises second person pronouns, including possessives and 
reflexives. When there is a high frequency of second person pronouns in a text, the 
communication context appear to be related to the text receiver(s) (Werlich, 1976: 136). 
Second person pronouns are used in instructional genres and in conversational genres 
(Connexor does not have a tag for second person pronouns). 
 
you 
yourself 
yourselves 
your 
yours
 
 
Third person. This facet comprises third person singular and plural pronouns, including 
possessives and reflexives. When there is a high frequency of third person pronouns in a text, 
the communication context appears to be related to persons in the spatio-temporal context 
outside the producer-receiver communication process (Werlich, 1976: 136). Third person 
pronouns are widespread in all genres (Connexor does not have a tag for third person 
pronouns).

Third person singular inanimate. This facet comprises the pronoun it, including possessives 
and reflexives (Werlich, 1976: 137). Third person pronouns are used in all genres and often 
indicate an objective or impersonal point of view. 
it subj:> # it in the subject position 
  # Ex: It strikes me.  
  # but not Make it softer. 
its 
itself 
 
Present tense group. This facet focuses on present tense, but comprises also present perfect 
and future. The present group is usually used in DESCRIPTION, EXPOSITION, ARGUMENTATION 
and INSTRUCTION (Werlich, 1976:144). It is less common in narration. 
@+FMAINV %VA V PRES   # Simple present 
# Ex: It rains; I usually eat salad; 
 
have main:>0  @+FMAINV %VA V PRES # have as main verb 
      # Ex: I have lunch with him. 
 
had.*?@+FAUXV %AUX V   # Present perfect  
      # Ex: I have developed a system;

      # Ex: She is nice; He is a sailor;  
 
will.*?@+FAUXV %AUX V AUXMOD  # Future tense 
      # Ex: You will see her later. 
 
shall.*?@+FAUXV %AUX V AUXMOD  # Future tense 
      # Ex: I shall go tomorrow. 
 
Past tense group. This facet focuses on past tense, but comprises also present and past 
perfect (Werlich, 1976: 144). Narrative texts show high frequencies of verbs in the past group. 
@+FMAINV %VA V PAST   # Simple past 
      # Ex: I visited him yesterday. 
 
had.*?@+FAUXV %AUX V   # Past perfect  
      # Ex: I had developed a system; 
 
Imperatives. This facet includes only imperatives. According to Biber  et al. (1999), the 
frequent use of imperatives is more common in conversation than in writing. The frequent use 
of imperatives in conversation is due to the fact that the situation is interactive, “with 
participants often involved in some sort of non-linguistic activity at the moment of speaking. 
In such situations, it is natural to use language for the purposes of monitoring the actions of 
 
 256
the addressee” (Biber et al., 1999: 221). Imperatives are also widespread in instructional 
genres (Werlich, 1976: 265), and persuasive genres. 
%VA V IMP  # Imperative 
   # Ex: Eat it up! 
 
Active. The active voice basically presents changes. The subject is usually viewed as an 
agent, affecting the external context. (Werlich, 1976: 147). The active voice is the normal 
choice in many genres (Biber 1999: 475 ff). 
%VA   # Active voice 
# Ex: We describe the experiment in the following 
section. 
 
Passive. In the passive voice, the subject is usually viewed as a recipient affected by 
something coming from the external context. It can also be used in objective genres to 
introduce an impersonal third person point of view. In some genres, the passive voice is 
frequently used for preserving anonymity (e.g. in INSTRUCTIONS or to suggest general validity 
for opinions (e.g. in COMMENTS) (Werlich, 1976: 148). 
%VP   # Passive voice 
# Ex: The experiment is described in the following 
section. 
 
agt   # Agent 
# Ex: The dog was chased by the boys. 
 
Time markers are connected to narrative genres (Werlich, 1976: 19, 39). 
dur:>   # Duration 
   # Ex: This was done in the last 25 years. 
 
frq:>   # Frequency 
   # Ex: It often involves the use of an additional tool. 
 
 
tmp:>   # Time 
   # Ex: When you leave, shut the door.  
 
 
Location markers are connected to descriptive genres (Werlich, 1976: 19, 39). 
loc:>   # Location 
   # Ex: This was done in the USA. 
 
sou:>   # Source 
 
 257
   # Ex: He will move from home very soon. 
 
pth:>   # Path 
   # Ex: He travelled from Stockholm to Rome. 
 
Instrument marker indicates the items used to undertake a task. It is connected with 
instrumental genres (Werlich, 1976: 268). 
ins:>   # Instrument 
   # Ex: He sliced the bread with an electric knife. 
 
Manner marker indicates the way in which something is done. It is connected to descriptive 
and instrumental genres (Werlich, 1976: 268). 
man:>.*?@ADVL # Manner 
   # Ex: He cooks poorly. 
 
Negative particles. Negative forms are much more common in conversation than in writing 
for several reasons. For example, verbs are more widespread in conversational genres and 
negation is often linked to verbs (Biber et al., 1999: 159). Negative particles are also quite 
common in ARGUMENTATION, where they are used to highlight the contrastive stance in the 
reasoning process. 
NEG-PART  # Negative particle 
   # Ex: They are not coming; They aren’t coming. 
 
Probability markers mark “some aspect of the reasoning process” (Biber, 1988: 241). They 
are common in argumentation (Werlich, 1976: 262).  
can 
could 
may 
might
 
 
Probability markers mark “reliability” (Biber, 1988: 241). They are common in instructional 
and persuasive genres. 
must  
should 
need  
ought
 
 
Existential there can have two functions. On the one hand, it can be considered as static, 
therefore INFORMATIONAL, since it precludes the presence of an active verb. For example, in 
There were thousands of glasses on the table. In this role, it is often used in 
 
 258
descriptive genres (Werlich, 1976: 217). On the other hand, it can be used in non-complex 
constructions, to reduce the informational load, and therefore might be more common in 
conversational genres (Biber, 1988: 228).  
@F-SUBJ %NH <Ex>  # Existential “there” 
    # Ex: There are interesting events coming soon. 
 
Expressiveness includes interjections and superlatives, elements that are typical of the 
hyperbolic style that can be found in advertisements and some other persuasive genres. 
INTERJ   # Interjection 
    # Ex: Hey, who do you think you are? 
SUP    # Superlative 
    # Ex: The highest mountains in the world. 
  
Activity verbs primarily denote actions and events that can be associated with a choice, and 
therefore take a subject with the semantic role of agent (Biber et al., 1999: 361, 366). These 
verbs are very common in instructional genres, but also in conversational genres. The list of 
verbs included in this facet comes from Biber et al. (1999: 367-368).

involves communication. Communication verbs are common in all genres including 
 
 259

Mental verbs denote a wide range of activities and states experienced by humans. They do 
not involve physical action and do not necessarily entail volition. Their subject often has the 
semantic role of recipient. They include both cognitive meaning and emotional meaning. 
They are common in conversational genres (Biber et al., 1999: 362, 366). The list of verbs 
included in this facet comes from Biber et al. (1999: 368).

Connectives are conjunctive adverbs not integrated in the clause structure that indicate a 
linkage with what has been already said (Werlich, 1976: 201). According to Werlich, different 
 
 261
sequences of conjunctive adverbs mark different text types (Werlich, 1976: 167, 202). For 
example, appositive, reformulatory, discoursal and reinforcing connectives are used in 
EXPOSITION and INSTRUCTION. Here the different classes of connectives have been taken from 
Quirk et al. (1985: 634 ff.). A description of their roles in different kinds of text can be found 
in Werlich (1976: 167-179).

Linguistic Facets: Syntactic Patterns 
Adverbial clauses 
The adverbial clauses included in this version of the facets are listed in Table 11. A 
breakdown follows. 
Concession clauses (initial, final, special92) indicate that the content in the main clause is 
contrary to expectations expressed in the concessive clause (Quirk et al., 1097-1098). Clauses 
of concession are introduced chiefly by although or its more informal variant though. Other 
subordinators used with concessive clauses are: if, even if, even though, when, whereas 
(formal), while, and whilst. There are also special constructions, i.e. unusual syntactic 
ordering, when the subordinators are as and though in formal style, as in Genius though she 
was, she was quite unassuming. Concession my also be expressed by several 
prepositional phrases followed by a relative clauses (despite, in spite of, irrespective of, 
regardless of, notwithstanding). They are considered to be stylistically clumsy (Quirk et al., 
1985: 1098). The position of the subordinate clause and punctuation marks can help 
disambiguate ambiguous subordinators. For example, ambiguity between concessive when 
and temporal when can be lowered with the help of a comma: concessive when is always in 
final position, often after a comma, as in: She paid, when she could have entered free 
(*When she could have entered free, she paid). Temporal when, on the other hand, 
                                                 
92 The labels "initial", "final", "special" indicate respectively initial position in a sentence, final position in a 
sentence, and special or unusual syntactic construction of the subclause. According to Biber et al. (1999: 831), 
the final position is the unmarked choice. 
 
 264
is more integrated with the main clause, as in: She was shocked when she heard the 
story (*She was shocked, when she heard the story; When she heard the story, 
she was shocked). Concessive clauses are widely used in ARGUMENTATION and 
argumentative genres (Werlich, 1976: 260).

Ex: Although he had just joined the company, he was treated exactly like 
all the other employees

Ex: Though well over eighty, he can walk faster than I can.

whereas@CS.*?SUBJ.*?FMAINV.*? , .*?$s_v_main 
Ex: Whereas the amendment is enthusiastically supported by a large majority 
in the Senate, its fate is doubtful in the House. 
 
The initial position of whereas disambiguates the concessive clause from the contrast clause. 
Usually in the contrast clause, whereas is in final position, as in: I ignore them, whereas 
my hushand is worried of what they think of us.

Ex: Naked as I was, I braved the storm 
 
 
Conditional clauses (initial, final, special) mainly express (not surprisingly) a condition. The 
two simple subordinators for conditional clauses are if and unless (Quirk et al., 1985: 1088 
ff.). Other subordinators are: as long as, so long as, assuming that, given that (formal), in 
case, in the event that, just so that (informal), on condition that, provided that, providing that, 
supposing that. According to Biber et al. (1999: 833), conditional clauses have different 
positional distributions across registers, and in written registers, there is a slight preference for 
the initial position. Special conditional constructions are represented by verbless clauses with 
with or without, as in Without me to supplement your income, you wouldn't be able 
to manage, or With them on our side, we are secure. Another formal construction is 
the one with subject inversion : Had Mark been in charge, it wouldn't have 
happened. All these patterns can be easily extracted in an automatic way. If can be both 
concessive and conditional. As we did not manage to disambiguate it for the time being, we 
assume that it is always conditional, also because concessive if seems to be in minority (If 
he is poor, he is honest). Conditional clauses are widely used in instruction and 
instructional genres (Werlich, 1976: 260), but also in argumentation.

Contrast clauses are introduced by several subordinators that also introduce concessive 
clauses (Quirk et al., 1985: 1102): whereas, while (also temporal) and whilst. The contrastive 
 
 267
meaning may be emphasized by in contrast and by contrast when the contrastive clause is 
initial. While concessive while is always in initial position, as in While he has many 
friends, Peter is lonely, temporal while can be in both positions: initial position, as in 
While I was asleep, I dreamt of you; or final position without a comma, as in They 
arrived while I was sunbathing. Contrast clauses controlled by while in final position 
are unambiguous in this respect, because they always follow a comma, as in: John teaches 
physics, while Mary teaches chemistry (*They arrived, while I was 
sunbathing).  
$s_v_main.*?, while.*?SUBJ.*?FMAINV 
Ex: Mr Larson teaches physics, while Mr Corby teaches chemestry. 
 
cf. the concessive pattern for 'whereas' above. 
$s_v_main.*?, whereas.*?SUBJ.*?FMAINV 
Ex: I ignore them, whereas my husband is always worried about what they 
think of us. 
 
 
Exception clauses are introduced by several subordinators: but that (formal), except that; less 
frequently excepting that and save that (formal) (Quirk et al., 1985: 1102). They seem to 
occur only in final position. 
$s_v_main.*?except@CS.*?SUBJ.*?FMAINV 
Ex: I would pay you now, except I don't have money on me. 
 
SUBJ.*?FMAINV.*?save@FMAINV _that@CS.*?SUBJ.*?FMAINV 
Ex: No memorial remains for the brave who fell on that battlefield, save 
that they will leave their image for ever in the hearts and minds of their 
grateful countrymen. 
 
SUBJ.*?FMAINV.*?but@CC _that@CS.*?SUBJ.*?FMAINV 
Ex: Nothing would satisfy the child but that I place her on my lap. 
 
SUBJ.*?FMAINV.*?but for@ADVL @<P @INFMARK> 
Ex: Nothing would satisfy the child but for me to place her on my lap. 
 
SUBJ.*?never.*?FMAINV.*?but.*@CC.*?SUBJ.*?FMAINV 
Ex: It never rains but it pours. 
 
 
Purpose clauses are more often infinitival than finite. More explicit subordinators of purpose 
are in order to (formal) and so as to. Finite clauses of purpose are introduced by so that or 
(less commonly and more informally) by so, and (more formally) by in order that (Quirk et 
al., 1985: 1107). Purpose clauses are syntactically very similar to infinitival nominal clauses 
 
 268
(I wished to go home vs. I left early to catch the train). A way of 
disambiguating them at a syntagmatic level is to use lexicalized verbs, because all nominal 
clauses are controlled by restricted sets of verbs (Biber et al., 1999: 700 ff.). Purpose clauses 
are widely used in INSTRUCTION and instructional genres (Werlich, 1976: 266).

The first group of parentheses in this pattern is used to check that the main verb of the 
sentence is not one of the verbs supporting infinitival “to”, for example want, wish, and so on 
The full list has been taken from Biber et al. (1999: 700-705) and Quirk et al. (1985: 1181 ff.). 
The algorithm checks that none of these verbs is in the part of the string between brackets. If 
so, the pattern is not matched.  
The second group of parentheses is used to check that there are no subordinators between the 
main verb of the sentence and the infinitival tag (INFMARK). The algorithm checks that none of 
the subordinators used in for the syntactic pattern creation is in the part of the string between 
brackets. If so, the pattern is not matched.

Reason clauses (initial, final) include several types of subordinate clauses. For all types, the 
word ‘reason’ is a superordinate term (cause and effect; reason and consequence; motivation 
and result; circumstances and consequence) (see Quirk et al., 1985: 1103 ff.). Reason clauses 
are most commonly introduced by the subordinators because and since. Other subordinators 
are as and for (formal). Because is unambiguous, since can be also temporal. However, 
temporal since always comes with present perfect in the matrix clause, while reason since 
does not (see the example below). For is disambiguated by the tag @CS, when it functions as 
subordinator. As (used for reason, similarity and time) cannot be disambiguated yet. Reason 
clauses in final position are the strong preference for conversational genres (Biber et al., 1999: 
833). Reason clauses are widely used in EXPOSITION (Werlich, 1976: 254) and 
ARGUMENTATION (Werlich, 1976: 260). 
REASON CLAUSE, INITIAL POSITION 
 
because@CS.*?SUBJ.*?FMAINV.*?$s_v_main 
Ex: Because we live near the sea, we often go sailing.(inventato) 
 
since@CS.*?SUBJ.*?FMAINV.*?SUBJ(.*?)FMAINV",  
Ex: Since we live near the sea, we often go sailing. 
 
The group of parentheses is used to check that the verb in the matrix clause is not a present 
perfect or a past perfect. These forms are allowed in the matrix clause only when “since” is 
temporal, as in: Since they lived in London, they have been increasingly happy 
(Quirk et al., 1985: 538 ff.) , and not when it is causal.  
REASON CLAUSE, FINAL POSITION 
 
$s_v_main.*?because@CS.*?SUBJ.*?FMAINV 
Ex: I lent him the money because he needed it. 
 
$s_v_main.*?for@CS.*?SUBJ.*?FMAINV 
Ex: Much has been written about psychic phenomena, for they pose 
fascinating problems that have yet to be resolved. 
 
SUBJ.*?FMAINV.*?since@CS.*?SUBJ(.*?)FMAINV 
Ex: I lent him the money because he needed it. 
Result clauses are introduced by the subordinators so that (formal), and so. These clauses 
overlap with those of purpose both in meaning and in subordinators. The main semantic 
 
 270
difference is that result clauses are factual and not putative, i.e. in result clauses the result is 
achieved, whereas in purpose clauses it is a desired result (Quirk et al., 1985: 1108 ff.). 
Therefore, clauses of result do not require a modal auxiliary (We paid him immediately, 
so he left contented), while purpose clauses often have one (We paid him 
immediately so he would leave contented). Result clauses can only appear in final 
position. Unlike purpose clauses, result clauses introduced by so are separated by a comma 
(Quirk et al., 1985: 1109). Result clauses are widely used in DESCRIPTION and descriptive 
genres (Werlich, 1976: 254). 
$s_v_main.*? , _so@ADVL _that@CS.*?SUBJ(.*?)FMAINV 
Ex: We paid him immediately, so that he left content. 
 
$s_v_main.*? , _so@CS.*?SUBJ(.*?)FMAINV 
Ex: We paid him immediately, so he left content. 
 
The group of parentheses is used to check that the verb in the matrix clause is not preceded by 
an auxiliary.  
Similarity, manner and comparison clauses are introduced by as and like (similarity and 
manner) and like (informal), as if, as though (comparison combined with manner) (Quirk et 
al., 1985: 1110-1111). Manner clauses are widely used in description and instruction 
(Werlich, 1976: 267). 
as@CS.*?SUBJ.*?FMAINV.*? , _so@CS.*?$s_v_main 
Ex: As a moth is attracted by a light, so he was attracted by her. 
 
$s_v_main.*?as if@CS.*?SUBJ.*?FMAINV 
Ex: He looks as if he's getting better. 
 
$s_v_main.*?as if@CS @FMAINV_ING 
Ex: He bent down as if tightening his shoe laces. 
 
$s_v_main.*?as if@CS @INFMARK> @FMAINV that@CS 
Ex: She winked at me as if to say that I shouldn't say anything. 
 
$s_v_main.*?as though@CS.*?SUBJ.*?FMAINV 
Ex: She treated me as though I was a stranger. 
 
 
Space clauses (initial, final) are introduced mainly by where or wherever (Quirk et al., 1985: 
1087). They indicate position or direction. Space clauses are widely used in description 
(Werlich, 1976: 254). 
 
 271
SPACE CLAUSE, INITIAL POSITION 
 
where.*?SUBJ.*?FMAINV.*?$s_v_main 
Ex 1: Where I saw only wilderness, they saw abundant signs of life. 
Ex 2: Wherever I saw only wilderness, they saw abundant signs of life.

Ex: Where the fire had been, we saw nothing but blackened ruins. 
 
SPACE CLAUSE, FINAL POSITION 
 
($s_v_main.*?)where.*?SUBJ.*?FMAINV 
Ex 1: They went where they could find work. 
Ex 2: They went wherever they could find work. 
 
The group of parentheses is used to check that the main verb of the sentence is not one of the 
verbs supporting wh-clauses, as in the example: I want you to show me where the car 
went down. If so, the pattern is not matched. 
Time clauses (initial, final, incidental, instructional) are introduced by one of the following 
subordinators: after, as, before, once, since, till, until, when whenever, while, whilst, now that, 
as long as, so long as, as soon as, immediately, and directly. Adverbial -ing clauses of time 
are introduced by one of the following subordinators: once, till, until, when, whenever, while, 
and whilst. Adverbial -ed clauses of time are introduced by one of the following subordinators 
that are also used with finite clauses: as soon as, once, till, until, when, whenever, and whilst. 
Verbless clauses of time are introduced by the same subordinators as -ed clauses. Until and 
till in verbless clauses are mainly used in instructional language (Quirk et al., 1985: 1079). 
-ing clauses without a subordinator or a subject may also express time relationship, as in 
Returning to my village after 15 years, I met an old schoolteacher (see Quirk 
et al., 1985: 1078 ff.). Time clauses are widely used in NARRATION (Werlich, 1976: 256) and in 
INSTRUCTION (Werlich, 1976: 267). 
TIME CLAUSE, INITIAL POSITION

Initial “when” is always temporal. Concessive “when” is always in final position, as in: She 
paid when she could have entered free (Quirk et al., 1985: 1097).

Complement/Nominal Clauses 
The complement/nominal clauses included in this version of the facets are listed in Table 12. 
A breakdown follows. 
Verb+that clause. Verbs taking that complement clauses in post-predicate position fall into 
three semantic domains: mental verbs, speech act verbs, and other communication verbs 
(Biber et al., 1999: 661). Post-predicate that-clauses after verbs are most common in 
conversational genres, and less common in academic genres (Biber et al., 1999: 674). 
main_FMAINV.*?_that@CS.*?SUBJ.*?FMAINV 
Ex 1: They warned him that it's dangerous. 
Ex 2: He was told that she had checked out of the hospital. 
 
 
Adjective+that clause. The adjectives that control a that complement clause convey stance93, 
and fall into three major semantic domains: degree of certainty, affective psychological states, 
and evaluation of situations, events, etc. (Biber et al., 1999: 671). Post-predicate that-clauses 
controlled by adjectives are most common in conversational genres (Biber et al., 1999: 674). 
PCOMPL-S_A _that@CS.*?SUBJ.*?FMAINV 
Ex: was quite confident that it would stay in very well. 
 
 
                                                 
93 “In addition to communicating propositional content, speakers and writers commonly express personal 
feelings, attidutes, value judgements, or assessments; that is, they express a ‘stance’.” (Biber et al., 1999: 966). 
 
 274
@<P _that@CS.*?$s_v_main 
Ex: It has been clear for some time that the demands of the arms control 
process would increasingly dominate military planning. 
 
that omission. According to Biber et al. (1999: 680 ff.), there are a number of discourse 
factors that influence the retention vs. omission of that. In conversation, the omission is the 
norm, while in writing it is the opposite. These distributional patterns correspond to different 
production circumstances and communicative purposes.  
SUBJ.*?main(.*?)SUBJ.*?FMAINV 
Ex: I hope you realised they said a few words on there. 
 
be_main.*?@PCOMPL-S_A(.*?)SUBJ.*?FMAINV 
Ex: I'm sure he was wrong. 
 
be_main.*?@PCOMPL-S_NOM(.*?)SUBJ.*?FMAINV 
Ex: It's a pity you don't know Russian. 
 
FMAINV.*?FMAINV_EN(.*?)SUBJ.*?FMAINV  
Ex: I'll do it provided you pay me. 
 
be@FAUXV.*?FMAINV_EN(.*?)SUBJ.*?FMAINV",  
Ex: It was hoped by everybody she would sing. 
 
The group of parentheses in the patterns indicate that the part of strings between brackets 
should not contain “that” or any other subordinators. If so, the pattern is not matched. 
wh-clause. Wh-clauses can be either dependent interrogative clauses or nominal relative 
clauses. Dependent interrogative clauses are used with verbs such as ask or wonder to ask an 
indirect question, as in I wonder what this is about. In contrast, nominal relative clauses 
have a more complicated structure, as in Whoever sorts Eagle [sic] out will make a 
lot of money (Biber et al., 1999: 683 ff.). Wh-clauses are more common in conversational 
genres (Biber et al., 1999: 688 ff.).

Ex: I want you to tell me when this happened. 
 
be_main.*?PCOMPL-S_A when*?SUBJ.*?FMAINV 
Ex: I'm not sure when it's open. 
 
 
Verb+to clause. The verbs taking to-clauses in the post-predicate position can be grouped 
into a number of semantic classes (Biber et al., 1999: 693 ff.). According to Biber et al. (1999: 
711), to-clauses in the post-predicate position typically perform specific functions in different 
registers.  
 
 276
FMAINV.*?FMAINV.*?@INFMARK>.*?FMAINV 
Ex: I'm just trying to get away early. 
I'm just trying to get away early. 
 
 
Adjective+to clause. Adjectival predicates controlling to-clauses come from a number of 
semantic domains (Biber et al., 1999: 718 ff.). Post-predicate to-clauses complementing an 
adjective are rare in conversational genres and common in press genres (Biber et al., 1999: 
722).  
PCOMPL-S_A.*?@INFMARK> 
Ex: Millar was obstinately determined to change the content of education. 
 
 
Verb+ing clauses are most commonly used in conjunction with an aspectual verb in the main 
clause (begin, start, stop), but they are also used to report speech acts, cognitive states, 
perceptions, emotions, and various other actions. They are mostly located in the post-
predicate position (Biber et al., 1999: 739). Overall, -ing clauses in the post-predicate position 
are most common in writing and least common in conversational genres (Biber et al. 1998: 
749). 
FMAINV(.*?) FMAINV_ING 
Ex 1: I remember reading this book. 
Ex 2: They talk about building more. 
 
 
Comparative clause. In a comparative construction, a proposition expressed in the main 
clause is compared with the proposition expressed in the subordinate clause (Quirk et al., 
1985: 1127 ff.). The frequency of comparative clauses in academic writing reflects the 
importance of comparison as a means of understanding and explicating reality (Biber et al., 
1999: 728-729.). Comparative clauses are also widely used in DESCRIPTION and descriptive 
genres (Werlich, 1976: 254). 
@SUBJ.*?main.*?@PCOMPL-S_CMP than@ADVL 
Ex: Jane is healthier than her sister. 
 
@SUBJ.*?main.*?@PCOMPL-S_A than@ADVL 
Ex: Mary is less old than Jane. 
 
@SUBJ.*?main.*?@OBJ @ADVL_CMP 
Ex: James enjoys the theatre more. 
 
 
 
 277
@SUBJ.*?main.*?@AD-A_CMP @ADVL 
Ex: Time passed more quickly than last year. 
 
@SUBJ.*?main.*?_as@AD-A> @SUBJ _as@CS @SUBJ 
Ex: I agree with you as much as I can. 
 
@SUBJ.*?main.*?_as@AD-A> @PCOMPL-S_A _as@CS 
Ex: The article was as objective as I expected. 
 
@SUBJ.*?main.*?@PCOMPL-S_A _enough@<AD-A @INFMARK> 
Ex: You are old enough to look after yourself. 
 
@SUBJ.*?main.*?_enough@OBJ.*?@INFMARK> 
Ex: She knows enough about the topic to explain it to you. 
 
 
Relative clauses. Restrictive/nominal relative clauses are different from sentential relative 
clauses. While restrictive/nominal relative clauses have a noun as antecedent, the sentential 
relative clause refers back to the predicate or to a whole sentence. For example, Things then 
improved, which surprises me is a sentential relative clause (Quirk et al., 1985: 1118) 
and I eat what I like is a restrictive relative clause (Quirk et al., 1985: 1056). In standard 
English, relative clauses can be formed using eight different relativizers: which, who, whom, 
whose, that, where, when, why, plus a zero relitiviser. The choice among relativisers is 
influenced by a number of factors, for example register, restrictive vs. non-restrictive 
function, animate vs. non animate head. Restrictive relative clauses are widely used in 
DESCRIPTION (Werlich, 1976: 254) and EXPOSITION (Werlich, 1976: 258). Relative clauses are 
currently extracted using two tags: 
<Rel>  
Ex 1: She knows enough about the topic to explain it to you. 
Ex 2: They are delighted with the person who has been appointed. 
 
 
who@DN> 
Ex: The woman whose daughter you met is Mrs. Brown. 
 
Main clauses 
The main clauses included in this version of the facets are listed in Table 13. A breakdown 
follows. 
The phenomenon registering sentence is used with reference to phenomena in space. It is a 
simple subject-predicate-adverbial structure with an adverb of place. The adverb 
 
 278
of place in the phenomenon registering sentence sets a spatial frame of reference within which 
the phenomena at the subject are placed, as in Thousands of glasses were on the 
table. A variant of the phenomenon registering sentence is the pattern with there followed by 
a verb form of be. Phenomenon registering sentences are widespread in DESCRIPTION 
(Werlich, 1976: 216-217). 
@SUBJ.*?main.*?loc_@ADVL_PREP 
Ex: Thousands of pilgrims were on the road to London. 
  
@SUBJ.*?main.*?pth_@ADVL_PREP 
Ex: Thousands of tourists moved to London. 
 
@SUBJ.*?main.*?sou_@ADVL_PREP 
Ex: Thousands of tourists moved away from London. 
 
@F-SUBJ be_main.*?@PCOMPL-S_NOM 
Ex: There was a long queue of cars. 
 
 
The action recording sentence is used with reference to phenomena in time. It is a simple 
subject-predicate-adverbial-(adverbial) structure with adverbs of place and 
time. The adverb of time in the action recording sentence sets a temporal frame of reference 
within which the phenomena at subject are placed, as in The passengers landed in New 
York in the middle of the night. Action recording sentences are widespread in 
NARRATION (Werlich, 1976: 217).  
SUBJ.*?main.*?tmp_@ADVL 
Ex: He went home for Christmas. 
 
"SUBJ.*?main.*?frq_@ADVL", 
Ex: he went back home often. 
 
SUBJ.*?main.*?dur_@ADVL 
Ex: this happened in the first 25 years. 
 
cla_@ADVL_PREP @<P 
Ex: At 10, the engine started. 
 
 
The phenomenon identifying sentence is used with reference to phenomena in relation to 
concepts. It is a simple subject-predicate-complement structure with a verb form 
of be at the predicate and a nominal group at the complement, as in One part of the brain 
is the cortex. The nominal group at the complement identifies the phenomenon referred to 
 
 279
in the nominal group at subject giving it a name, a class or a role. Phenomenon identifying 
sentences in the present are common in EXPOSITION (Werlich, 1976: 217-218). 
@SUBJ be_main.*?@PCOMPL-S_NOM  
Ex: These are nerve cells or neurones. 
 
 
The phenomenon linking sentence is used with reference to phenomena in part-of 
relationship with other phenomena. It is a three element patterns, subject-predicate-
complement, with a verb form of have at the predicate and a nominal group at the 
complement, as in The brain has ten million neurones. Phenomenon-linking sentences 
in the present tense are common in EXPOSITION (Werlich, 1976: 218). 
SUBJ have_main.*?OBJ 
Ex: The brain has a network of swichtes. 
 
 
The quality attributing sentence is used with reference to qualities and properties of 
phenomena. It is a simple subject-predicate-complement structure with a verb 
form of be at the predicate and an adjective (or equivalent) at the complement, as in The 
obsession with durability in the arts is not permanent. Negative quality 
attributing sentences are common in ARGUMENTATION (Werlich, 1976: 218-219). 
SUBJ.*?be_main.*?PCOMPL-S_A 
Ex: Endurance in art forms is essential, claims George. 
 
 
The action demanding sentence is used with reference to behavioral responses from the 
addressee. Its basic form is the command, as in Be reasonable for a moment!. Action 
demanding sentences are common in INSTRUCTION (Werlich, 1976: 219).  
main_FMAINV_IMP.*?OBJ 
Ex: Add a layer of pebbles to prevent the soil being washed away. 
 
@FAUXV_IMP.*?OBJ 
Ex: Do not add fertilizer or manure. 
Linguistic Facets: Genre-Specific-Word Facets 
I created sets of genre-specific words for the genres included in the 7-web-genre collection 
and the KI-04 corpus (see Appendix A). Ideally, these groups of lexical items contain a set of 
 
 280
words that are topic-independent, but are regularly used in the genres they were created for. 
The genre-specific-word facets used in this thesis are shown in List 5 and List 6. 
blog_words (7-web-page collection) 
eshop_words (7-web-page collection and KI-04 corpus) 
faq_words (7-web-page collection) 
frontpage_words (7-web-page collection) 
listing_words (7-web-page collection) 
php_words (7-web-page collection) 
spage_words (7-web-page collection) 
 
List 5. Genre-specific words for the 7-web-genre collection 
 
 
article_words (KI-04 corpus) 
discussion_words (KI-04 corpus) 
download_words (KI-04 corpus) 
help_words (KI-04 corpus) 
list_of_links_words (KI-04 corpus) 
portrayal_non_priv (KI-04 corpus) 
portrayal_priv (KI-04 corpus) 
shop_words (7-web-page collection and KI-04 corpus) 
 
List 6. Genre-specific words for the KI-04 corpus 
 
As explained in Chapter 5, these words relate to genre-specific referential vocabulary, such as 
“Welcome to my personal home page”, “Thank you for stopping by my personal home page”, 
“This blog is my corner”, “Are you looking for something? ABACHO the powerful search 
engine will find it for you!”, etc. Additionally, they include a number of other words relating 
to the function of the web page. For example, eshop words contain terms such as buy, order, 
purchase, etc. connected to the function of ‘selling’ and not to what is actually sold, which 
can vary from fruit to electronic equipment, to clothes to estates. 
In order to select these sets of genre-specific words, I first tried with the automatic extraction 
of the most common coontent words per genre and then measured the coverage of these words 
over the web pages belonging to a single genre. The original idea was to use words (not all 
words, but only lemmas from nouns, adjectives and verbs) that would occur in 80% of web 
pages per genre. The result of this automatic approach was quite disappointing. Here is an 
example of blog words with a coverage of at least 80% in BLOG web pages: 
 
281 
go 
post 
comment 
time 
day 
good 
find 
only 
thing 
new 
look 
archive 
way 
work 
 
Words like post, day, comment, can be good suggestions because BLOGS often contain 
sentences like “posted by” or “comment #” or “number of comments” and so on. However, 
words such as good, find, new cannot be considered blog words and presumably they do not 
have much discriminating power. This list is too corpus-dependent, and even if the threshold 
of the coverage is decreased from 80% to 60% or 50%, the list of automatic extracted words 
still lacks generality.  
In order to make a more comprehensive and potentially more general list, I created new lists 
based on a cursory qualitative analysis of the web genres. These qualitative lists was conflated 
with some of the most interesting words coming from automatic extraction. Here are the lists 
of genre-specific words included in the final sets of genre-specific-word facets:

HTML Facets 
As explained in Chapter 5, HTML facets are groups of HTML tags interpreted functionally. 
The six HTML facets used in this thesis are shown in List 7.  
1. layout 
2. typography 
3. functionality 
4. navigability_general 
5. navigability_ external 
6. navigability_ internal 
List 7. HTML facets 
Layout  
The layout facet contains HTML tags that relate to the formatting of the text. Some genres are 
more regularly laid-out than others. For example, FAQs or BLOGS are moderately laid-out, 
while FRONT PAGES or ESHOPS rely more on the visual impact of structured information. The 
influence of layout in different genres is not new (cf. Waller, 1989, but also the GEM 
project94). The HTML tags included in the layout facet are shown in List 8. 
<br  # break the flow of a line,  
<dl  # create a definition list  
<dir  # create a directory list 
<div  # division 
<hr  # horizontal rule 
<listing # listing text (obsolete) 
<menu  # crate a menu list 
<ol  # ordered list 
<table  # table 
<ul  # unordered list, i.e. bulleted list 
<p>  # paragrap 
<pre  # preformatted text 
List 8. Layout facet 
 
                                                 
94 GEM stands for Genre and Multimodality: a computer model of genre in document layout (see 
<http://www.fb10.uni-bremen.de/anglistik/langpro/projects/gem/newframe.html>). 
 
 286
Typography 
Typographic devices are widely used in all web pages. Typography is a traditional device of 
highlighting the importance of information (cf. Waller, 1989). Some web genres rely more on 
typography than others. For example, FRONT PAGES employ lots of headings, while FAQs are 
plainer. The HTML tags included in the typography facet are shown in List 9. 
<abbr   # abbriaviation  
<acronym  # acronym  
<address  # usually rendered in an italic font 
<b>   # bold 
<big   # bit text 
<blockquote  # a block quotation 
<caption  # caption for a table 
<center   # center the text 
<cite   # identify a citation 
<em   # emphasis, usually italics 
<font   # change font characteristics 
<h1   # heading 
<h2   # heading 
<h3   # heading 
<h4   # heading 
<h5   # heading 
<h6   # heading 
<i   # italics 
<img   # a link to an external image 
<q   # quote 
<s   # strikeout 
<small   # small text 
<strike   # strikeout 
<strong   # usually bold 
<style   # style sheet definition 
<sub   # subscript 
<sup   # superscript 
<tt   # typewriter text 
<u   # underline 
alt   # a short description of an image 
List 9. Typography facet 
Functionality 
Functionality refers to the use of hyperlinks, the possibility of interaction with other users or 
other facilities, like email services. As pointed out and showed by Shepherd and Watters 
(1988, 1989) and Shepherd et al. (2004), functionality is the most distinctive attribute of web 
genres, and cannot be excluded when dealing of genres of web pages. Shepherd et al. (2004) 
tried the functionality attribute on PERSONAL HOME PAGES, ORGANIZATIONAL HOME PAGES and 
CORPORATE HOME PAGES. Their results show that this attribute had a statistically significant 
improvement only to PERSONAL and CORPORATE HOME PAGES classification. They included 
traits like the number of “form inputs or the “proportion of links that are links to locations 
within the same page”, but also binary traits such as “is JavaScript included from an external 
file?” or “is JavaScript written into the HTML?”. 
The HTML tags included in the functionality facet are shown in List 10.

General Navigability 
The importance of the textual interpretation of links has become increasingly acknowledged. 
For instance, a number of qualitative analyses of links in relation to genre have been carried 
out by Haas and Grams (1998) Roberts (1998), Crowston and Williams (1999), Amitay 
(2000). In particular, it is worth mentioning the dual model proposed by Askehave and 
Nielsen (2004, 2005).

Appendix C.  Function Words, POS Tags, 
and HTML Tags 
This appendix lists the some of the features – namely function words in English, POS 
tags and HTML tags –that I used in the experiments described in the thesis. 
Function Words 
The rationale behind the use of the frequencies of function words (a method used in 
stylometry) is that they are expected to remain invariant for the same author. This 
assumption has been exported to automatic genre detection by Stamatatos et al. (2000), 
who used the 50 most common words in the BNC (which mostly coincide with function 
words) on the Wall Street Journal corpus with good accuracy results. The 50 common 
words suggested by Stamatatos et al. (2000) and used in this research are shown in 
Figure 63. 
 
Figure 63. The 50 most common words in the BNC (from Stamatatos et al., 2000) 
POS Tags 
The distribution of POS tags has been proved to vary across different genres. Several 
studies have been conducted within corpus linguistics that prove this variation, for 
example Nakamura (1993) and Rayson et al. (2002). POS tags have been included in 
several studies in automatic genre classification, e.g. Karlgren and Cutting (1994) and 
 
 290
Meyer zu Eissen and Stein (2004). The POS tags used in this thesis belong to Connexor 
tagset (the complete tagset is available at <http://www.connexor.com/demo/doc/enfdg3-
tags.html>) and are listed in Table 57. 
ABBR=abbriviation ADJ=adjective 
ADV=adverb CC=coordinating conjunction 
CS=subordinating conjunction DET=determiner 
EN=past participle Ex=existential 'there' 
INFMARK=infinitive marker, i.e. 'to' ING=-ing marker for verb 
INTERJ=interjection Inter=interrogative marker 
NEGPART=negative particle N=noun 
NUM=numeral PREP=preposition 
PRON=pronoun PRON PERS=personal pronouns 
Rel=relative marker V AUX MOD=auxiliary 
V IMP=imperative V INF=infinitive 
V PAST=past V PRES=present 
Table 57. POS tags used in this thesis 
HTML Tags 
The distribution of HTML tags is discriminating across different types of web pages. In 
particular, Lim et al. (2005a, 2005b) have specifically tested their discrimination power. 
The list of the 28 HTML tags used in this research is shown in Table 58.

Appendix D.  Web Genres 
This appendix briefly describes the web genres included in the BBC web genre 
collection and the 7-web-genre collection. It also contains a cursory overview of the 
web genre labels employed for the web user study in Chapter 8. 
The web genres included in the KI-04 corpus are briefly described in Appendix A or in 
Meyer zu Eissen and Stein (2004). As already pointed out in Appendix A, the SPIRIT 
collection is not annotated by genre. 
Web Genres in the BBC Web Genre Collection 
The genres included in the BBC web genre collection are EDITORIALS, DIY (DO-IT-
YOURSELF) MINI-GUIDES, SHORT BIOGRAPHIES, and FEATURES ARTICLES. A brief 
overview of their characteristics follows. 
EDITORIALS  
Figure 64 shows an example of a BBC EDITORIAL, which appears to keep some of the 
traditional textual characteristics of the EDITORIAL genre on paper.  
According to Werlich (1976: 112), the EDITORIAL (a.k.a. LEADING ARTICLE or LEADER) 
is kind of comment, where “the editor addresses the reader as a citizen of the political 
community at large and aims at seeing his advocated solution to a problem put to the 
test of practical political action”. In other words, “it is an argumentative statement of 
views that are considered to be representative of a newspaper as a whole”. The 
EDITORIAL also contains INSTRUCTIONAL slots that present some actions that should be 
taken. An EDITORIAL is usually considered to be a mixture of ARGUMENTATION and 
EXPOSITION or NARRATION (Vestergaard, 2000: 102).  
Appendix D - Web Genres 
 292
 
Figure 64. Example of a BBC editorial 
DIY MINI-GUIDES  
Figure 65 shows an example of a BBC DIY MINI-GUIDE. The BBC DIY MINI-GUIDES 
show a very regular compositional plan: some general information about the project, 
duration time, etc.; a list of tools needed to operate; a short headline introducing the 
topic of the following paragraph; finally a sequence of instructions.  
This kind of genre appears to be mainly INSTRUCTIONAL and to a lesser extent 
ARGUMENTATIVE or PERSUASIVE. As noted by Janoschka (2004), these two text types 
often interact with each other, because giving an instruction is often linked to 
persuasion, and vice-versa.

Appendix D – Web genres 
 293
Short BIOGRAPHIES  
Figure 66 shows an example of the BBC SHORT BIOGRAPHIES. They are mainly 
characterized by the NARRATION text type. Several recurrent linguistic features can be 
identified in a BIOGRAPHY, for instance the past tense is used to report events together 
with temporal markers and location markers. Also the third person is the norm (e.g. cf. 
Factor 2 in Biber, 1988). Very often NARRATION is mixed with DESCRIPTION (Fludernik, 
2000), since it is very hard to report events without placing them in an environment or a 
some kind of context. 
 
Figure 66. Example of a BBC short biography 
FEATURE Articles 
Figure 67 shows an example of the BBC FEATURE ARTICLES. According to the Longman 
Dictionary of Contemporary English95, a FEATURE is a piece of writing about a subject 
in a newspaper or magazine or a special report on television or on the radio. BBC 
FEATURES appear to be INFORMATIONAL, often integrated with INSTRUCTION in the form 
of ‘do and don’ts’.

Web Genres in the 7-Web-Genre Collection 
The web genres included in the 7-web-genre collection – BLOGS, ESHOPS, FAQS, 
ONLINE NEWSPAPER FRONT PAGES, LISTINGS, PERSONAL HOME PAGES, and SEARCH PAGES 
– have not received equal attention from genre analysts. Some of them have been 
intensively studied, for example BLOGS and PERSONAL HOME PAGES. Others have not 
been investigated at all, but are often included in automatic genre classification studies, 
for instance ESHOPS (cf. Meyer zu Eissen and Stein, 2004).  
In the next paragraphs, I will provide a short overview of these seven web genres.  
BLOGS 
Different types of BLOGS (short form for WEB LOGS) have been listed so far (cf. Herring 
et al., 2005; see also Wikipedia’s entry for ‘blog’). BLOGS are usually long texts, 
divided into daily reports, like the entries in a diary. An interesting interpretation of 
BLOG as a hybrid genre, together with a comprehensive bibliography, is in Herring et al., 
(2005).  
The PERSONAL BLOGS included in this collection are diary-style PERSONAL BLOGS where 
the author (a blogger) expresses whatever s/he thinks, fears or experiences using entries 
posted in reverse chronological order. In PERSONAL BLOGS, the emphasis is on 
Appendix D – Web genres 
 295
NARRATION of personal events in a form similar to handwritten diaries (cf. Herring et al., 
2005), often accompanied with ARGUMENTATION (cf. Moor and Efimova, 2004).  
From a computational point of view, binary BLOG classification has been tried by 
Elgersma and de Rijke (2006) with good results. An interesting statistical model has 
been proposed by Généreux and Evans (2006a, 2006b) to distinguish affective states in 
weblog posts. 
ESHOPS 
As far as I am aware, no genre analyses have been carried out so far on the ESHOP genre. 
From my personal observation, I consider an ESHOP as an interactive document, with its 
own purpose (i.e. selling products), rhetorical function (persuade potential buyers), 
textual conventions (i.e. use of exhortations and a special typographical organization), 
and expectations (i.e. prices, pictures, short descriptions, offers, etc.). An ESHOP is often 
organized as a list of products with prices. 
The ESHOP genre has a clear antecedent in the paper world, namely the catalogues for 
home shopping by mail order, such as Argos or Littlewoods catalogues in the UK. 
Apparently, the move from the paper genre to the web genre has been straightforward. 
ESHOP is acknowledged as a genre by studies dealing with automatic genre classification 
on the web, such as Roussinov et al. (2001) and Meyer zu Eissen et al. (2004).  
FAQS 
FAQS (FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS) were created early in the history of the Internet 
and were popular on Usenet96 (cf. Crowston and Williams, 2000). Their origin is not 
clear (cf. also Hendricksen, 2002), but they have a very close antecedent in the paper 
world in the Troubleshooting section of technical manuals. However, FAQS on the web 
are not limited to technical questions. FAQS can be seen as a written form of a help desk 
or information desk. 
                                                 
96 Usenet is a distributed Internet discussion system (see Wikipedia’ entry for ‘usenet’). 
Appendix D - Web Genres 
 296
Virtually any website has a FAQS section, where common problems experienced by 
users are explained in the form of questions and answers. Questions and answers can be 
organized in different ways. For instance, a FAQS can be a single document with a 
regular pattern of question + answer sequence; or each page can contain a single 
question and an answer; or all the questions are listed in one page hyperlinked to other 
pages (answers are provided in one different page per question); and similar.  
The FAQs genre shows an INSTRUCTIONAL text types (e.g. How to install the card) or 
EXPLICATORY and INFORMATIONAL text types (e.g. What is a monsoon?).  
FAQS are listed among the organizational pages in the qualitative web page 
classification scheme suggested in Haas and Grams (1998). Crowston and Williams 
(1999) studied the effect of linking on 100 random FAQS downloaded from the Web 
and identified four patterns of linking. The purpose of their study was to describe how 
genres might evolve given the capability of the web to link between pages. Their 
conclusion is that it remains uncertain to what extent FAQS have adapted to the 
capabilities of the web and led to the establishment of a new genre. FAQs are 
considered to be a reproduced genre in Crowston and Williams (2000), but a novel 
genre by Shephered and Watters (1998) (see also footnote 4). 
FAQS are often included in automatic genre classification experiments, for example by 
Lim et al. (2005b) and Boese (2005). 
ONLINE FRONT PAGES 
A FRONT PAGE is the first page of a newspaper. In the paper world it was mainly a 
component of a newspaper bearing the initial part of the most important articles. On the 
web, a FRONT PAGE has a more autonomous status than in the paper world.  
As a genre, the ONLINE FRONT PAGE was analysed by Ihlström and Åkesson (2004). 
These authors investigated 85 Swedish front pages using the quadruple <content, form, 
functionality, positioning> (an amplification of the triple <content, form, functionality> 
proposed by Shepherd and Watters, 1998) and found that most of them represent a 
Appendix D – Web genres 
 297
“variant” or “progressed” genre, while only 13 out of 85 can be considered as a 
replicated genre.  
The genre ONLINE FRONT PAGE has never been included in automatic genre classification 
experiments. 
LISTINGS 
As described in Appendix A, I collected under the LISTING super-genre four kinds of 
lists, namely HOTLISTS, SITEMAPS, TABLES OF CONTENTS, and CHECKLISTS.  
TABLE OF CONTENTS, SITEMAPS (a.k.a. SITE CONTENT), HOTLISTS (a.k.a. INDEX) appear 
together under the organizational pages in the qualitative web page classification 
scheme suggested in Haas and Grams (1998). Surprisingly, in the same study, the item 
“LIST” appears under text pages, together with ARTICLES, and SCHOLARLY PAPERS. 
Lists are important linguistic devices, but so far their characteristics have been rarely 
studied. Rare examples of list analyses are in Askehave and Swales (2001), who 
describe SHOPPING LISTS, and Bouayad-Agha et al. (1999), who focus on lists in 
PATIENT INFORMATION LEAFLETS. 
Broadly speaking, a LIST is a synthetic way of delivering information or giving 
instructions. The visual organization into bullets or numbers provides a visual support 
that replaces other linguistic devices, such as connectives. LISTS can be seen as a textual 
solution where juxtaposition prevails over subordinating constructions. The 
predominance of their text types is not clear.  
As concerns LISTS on the web, HOTLISTS have been considered a novel genre by 
Crowston and Williams (2000). An interesting analysis of lists on the web is in Hendry 
and Carlyle (2006), who argue that the antecedent of many listing devices on the web is 
the BIBLIOGRAPHY genre. 
LIST OF LINKS as genre have been included in the genre palette of the KI-04 corpus. 
Boese (2005) includes SITEMAPS in her genre collection. Lim et al. (2005b), who use 
Karlgren’s palette, conflate tables and LISTS in the same genre category. 
Appendix D - Web Genres 
 298
PERSONAL HOME PAGES (PHPS) 
HOME PAGES constitute a standalone type in the qualitative web page classification 
scheme suggested in Haas and Grams (1998). The authors consider the HOME PAGE 
genre as unique to the web (similarly to Dillon and Gushrowski, 2000), although it 
shows some resemblances to some paper genres. In their schemes, HOME PAGES 
subsumes to ORGANIZATION HOME PAGES, PERSONAL HOME PAGES, and SPLASH SCREENS. 
For Schmid-Isler (1997), HOME PAGES, intended as entry pages of a web site, have no 
standard visual patterns, but some components appear to be constitutive in their web 
design, for example emphasized words, which indicate hyperlinks.  
Askehave and Nielsen (2004, 2005) use the HOME PAGE genre to exemplify their non-
linear, multi-modal theoretical genre model, while Beaudouin et al. (2004) propose an 
interpretation of the HOME PAGES as ‘draft versions’ (“brouillons”) of web documents. 
The 7-web-page collection contains only PERSONAL HOME PAGES. A PERSONAL HOME 
PAGE is a page published and maintained by an individual. The ownership of PERSONAL 
HOME PAGES can almost always be determined from page titles and headings (e.g. 
“Home page of Christoph G. Eisenhardt”, “My Home Page”, “Olli`s World”, 
“Christina’s Corner”, “Sugianto’s Little Palace”, “The Miller Family Home Page”, etc.).  
PERSONAL HOME PAGES have been defined as “narrative of self-evaluation” (Roberts 
1998), and analysed also in terms of the construction of identity (Miller and Arnold, 
2001; Chandler and Roberts-Young, 1998). However, Döring (2001) finds that only 
42% of the PERSONAL HOME PAGES listed in the university directories corresponded to 
the image of the typical self-presentation page.  
In 1998, Saint-Georges considered the PERSONAL HOME PAGE to be still an emerging 
genre (Saint-Georges, 1998). However, in 2000 Dillon and Gushrowski (Dillon and 
Gushrowski, 2000) found that at least half of their experimental subjects agreed on a 
number of recurrent features that should appear on the PERSONAL HOME PAGE. For this 
reason, they concluded that the PERSONAL HOME PAGE is a fully-formed genre, more 
precisely the first genre unique to the web.  
Appendix D – Web genres 
 299
Interestingly, Amitay (2000) analyses the linguistic characteristics of the ‘anchors’, i.e. 
the text used in the hyperlinks, in 155 PERSONAL HOME PAGES, unveiling linguistic uses 
that may be considered specific to the genre. 
From a computational point of view, the ACADEMIC´S PERSONAL HOME PAGE subgenre 
has been analysed by Rehm (2002, 2005, 2006), who proposes a language-independent 
parser of the HTML documents included in the ACADEMIC´S PERSONAL HOME PAGE 
websites (see also Section 2.4). 
PERSONAL HOME PAGES are often used in automatic genre classification experiments. For 
example, Shepherd and co-workers (Shepherd et al., 2004; Kennedy et al., 2005) 
explore the extent of discrimination among HOME PAGE genres, such as PERSONAL HOME 
PAGES, ORGANIZATIONAL HOME PAGES, and CORPORATE HOME PAGES. They find that 
while PERSONAL and CORPORATE HOME PAGES can be discriminated reasonably well, 
ORGANIZATIONAL HOME PAGES are too mixed or ‘unsettled’ to achieve a good 
discrimination rate.  
SEARCH PAGES 
SEARCH PAGES are listed under search tools in the qualitative web page classification 
scheme suggested by Haas and Grams (1998). According to Schmid-Isler (1997), 
SEARCH PAGES belong to the fourth generation sites, those that focus on the architecture 
with dynamic content.  
SEARCH PAGES have no obvious antecedent among the paper genres. Typically, a 
SEARCH PAGE contains a field where the user enters keywords. The level of functionality 
and interactivity in SEARCH PAGES is usually very high. Interactive pages were 
considered to be a novel genre by Crowston and Williams (2000).  
No qualitative analysis has been dedicated to SEARCH PAGES. From my personal 
observation, they appear to be characterized by short text, input fields labelled with 
imperatives or nouns, mostly showing a mixture of INFORMATIONAL and INSTRUCTIONAL 
text types. 
Appendix D - Web Genres 
 300
Online SEARCH PAGES have never been included in automatic genre classification 
experiments. 
Other Genre Labels 
In this section, I will briefly describe some web genre labels employed in the user study 
described in Chapter 897 and not included in the previous sections. More precisely, I 
will provide a short description of the following labels: ABOUT PAGE, CLOG, EMAIL, 
EZINE, HOW-TO, NET AD, NEWSLETTER, ONLINE FORM, ONLINE TUTORIAL and SPLASH 
SCREEN. As concerns ACADEMIC, CORPORATE and ORGANIZATIONAL HOME PAGES, they 
are briefly mentioned under the heading ‘Personal Home Pages’, in the previous 
section. Similarly, HOTLISTS and SITE MAPS can be found under the heading ‘Listings’. 
Most definitions of the genre labels listed in this section are taken from online 
encyclopaedias or dictionaries, such as Webopedia98, Wikipedia99, or a high-tech 
dictionary100. 
ABOUT PAGES 
The ABOUT PAGE is a page about an organization, a company or similar, which provides 
information about the aim and the scope of these entities. Given the recurrent presence 
in many web sites and the predictable type of information it provides, it has the 
potential of becoming an acknowledged novel genre in the near future.  
CLOGS 
The label CLOG can be interpreted as short for concert BLOG or community BLOG. It has 
been included in the web user study to investigate to what extent this potential genre is 
acknowledged among web users.

Appendix D – Web genres 
 301
EMAILS  
EMAIL, short for electronic mail, is a subfunction of the Internet. The EMAIL genre has a 
multitude of particular purposes. It may be used as a form of person-to-person 
communication, or as person-to-group communication in the case of sending to an email 
list. Some aspects of communication by email have been studied. For instance, the use 
of email for academic communication (Gruber, 2000), the strategies of politeness 
employed in email exchange (Harrison, 2000), or the analysis of the group interaction in 
email communication (Taylor, 2000).  
The basic structure of an email consists of the following parts: 1) email address of the 
recipient; 2) subject; 3) salutation; 4) body of message; and 5) sign-off. 
Broadly speaking, the EMAIL genre is somewhat less formal than conventional letters. 
Although there are instances of elegant and fully grammatical discourse via email, it 
seems that email communication tends to be colloquial. Because of the ‘smilies’, other 
emoticons and ‘netiquette’, the EMAIL genre has its own vocabulary peculiar to this 
informal written medium.  
EZINES  
EZINE stands for Electronic-magaZINE. It is a type of Internet publication or electronic 
magazine. It can take the form of a newsletter published by a company or a special 
interest group, or an ‘Internet edition’ of a real-life magazine.  
The EZINE label has been included in the web user study to investigate to what extent 
this potential genre is acknowledged among web users. 
HOW-TOS 
HOW-TO pages are listed under the documentation category in the qualitative web page 
classification scheme suggested by Haas and Grams (1998).  
HOW-TOS provide practical advice and detailed steps to accomplish a specific task. They 
are meant to help non-experts, and may leave out details that are only important to 
experts. HOW-TOS are mostly organized as INSTRUCTIONAL texts.  
Appendix D - Web Genres 
 302
Boese and Howe (2005a) tried to automatically discriminate between HOW-TOS and 
TUTORIALS (see this entry below) but preliminary results show that a classification 
algorithm cannot easily discriminate among them. 
NET ADS 
NET ADS are considered to be an emerging genre by Fortanet et al. (1998). An in-depth 
qualitative analysis of net ads, and web advertising in general, can be found in 
Janoschka (2004).  
NEWSLETTERS 
A NEWSLETTER is a regular publication sent by email focussing on a particular subject, 
such as the news of a special interest group. It may include also announcements and 
events. 
ONLINE FORMS 
An online form is a formatted document containing blank fields that users can fill in 
with data. Electronic forms are especially common on the web because the HTML 
language has built-in codes for displaying form elements, such as text fields and check 
boxes.  
ONLINE TUTORIALS 
A TUTORIAL is an INSTRUCTIONAL lesson that leads the user through software 
applications, hardware devices, processes, system designs, programming languages, and 
so forth. The TUTORIAL typically is set up as a series of steps. The term ‘tutorial’ is 
widely used on the web, since there are many web sites that offer tutorials on almost 
everything. It is somewhat similar to HOW-TOS (see this entry above). 
SPLASH SCREENS 
A SPLASH SCREEN (or SPLASH PAGE) is an initial web site page used to capture the user's 
attention as a promotion, or leads into the home page. SPLASH SCREENS are also used to 
tell the users what kind of browser and other software they need to view the site. Some 
Appendix D – Web genres 
 303
websites use the term ‘splash page’ to mean the home page itself, especially where it 
contains multimedia effects, that create a ‘splash’.  
For Crowston and Williams (2000), SPLASH PAGES belong to unclassified pages, while 
for Haas and Grams (1998), they are related to home pages, and serve as the cover page 
of a website.

Appendix G - Four Broad Text Types and their Facets

Appendix G.  Four Broad Text Types and 
their Facets 
This appendix provides a short description of the four broad text types used in the 
inferential model presented in Chapter 11, and lists the co-occurrence of linguistic 
facets that characterize them. Facets are described in Chapter 5 and Appendix C. 
Descriptive_Narrative 
The DESCRIPTIVE_NARRATIVE text type conflates the DESCRIPTIVE type of text from the 
BBC Skillswise website, the DESCRIPTIVE and NARRATIVE types from Werlich (1976), and 
IMAGINATIVE NARRATIVE from Biber (1989). Broadly speaking, DESCRIPTION is perception 
in space, while NARRATION represents perception in time. They often go together because 
it is difficult to imagine a NARRATION without the location of events in a space (cf. 
Fludernik, 2000). This is why the DESCRIPTIVE_NARRATIVE type includes features (28 
facets) that relate primarily to phenomena in space and in time (see List 14). 
phen_registering 
cont_act_recording 
act_recording 
space_clause_initial 
space_clause_final 
time_clause_initial 
time_clause_final 
time_clause_split

temporal_connectives 
resultative_connectives 
summative_connectives 
communication_verbs 
mental_verbs 
occurrence_verbs 
aspectual_verbs
 
List 14. 28 facets included in the descriptive_narrative text type 
Explicatory_Informational 
The EXPLICATORY_INFORMATIONAL text type includes features related to nouns. A high 
frequency of noun indicates high density of information because nouns bear most of the

322 
referential meaning in a text. This type conflates the INFORMATIVE type from the BBC 
Skillswise website, the EXPLICATORY type from Werlich (1976), and INFORMATIONAL 
INTERACTION from Biber (1989). This text type encompasses 25 linguistic facets (see 
List 15).

Argumentative_Persuasive 
The ARGUMENTATIVE_PERSUASIVE text type conflates the PERSUASIVE type from the BBC 
Skillswise website, ARGUMENTATION from Werlich (1976), and INVOLVED PERSUASION 
from Biber (1989). The ARGUMENTATIVE_PERSUASIVE text type focuses on convincing, 
using logical or emotional arguments. It encompasses 34 linguistic facets (see List 16).

phen_identifying_mod 
negative_particles

Instructional 
The INSTRUCTIONAL text type includes features related to activities and verbs (especially 
imperatives and necessity modals). It conflates the INSTRUCTIVE type from the BBC 
Skillswise website, and INSTRUCTION from Werlich (1976). This text type includes 30 
linguistic facets (see List 17).
