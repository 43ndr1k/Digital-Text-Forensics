Abstract. Authorship verification is the task of, given a document and a candidate author, determining whether or not 
the document was written by the candidate author. Traditional approaches to authorship verification have revolved 
around a “candidate author vs. everything else” approach. Thus, perhaps the most important aspect of performing au-
thorship verification on a document is the development of an appropriate distractor set to represent “everything not the 
candidate author”. The validity of the results of such experiments hinges on the ability to develop an appropriately rep-
resentative set of distractor documents. Here, we propose a method for performing authorship verification without the 
use of a distractor set. Using only training data from the candidate author, we are able to perform authorship verifica-
tion with high confidence (greater than 90% accuracy rates across a large corpus).  
Keywords. Authorship verification, authorship attribution, corpus linguistics, computational stylometry. 
1 Introduction 
In traditional authorship attribution, our task is to as-
sign an author label (or a similar categorical label such as 
genre, publication date, etc.) to a work of unlabeled au-
thorship. In the closed-set problem, we assign a label from 
a set of potential authors for whom we have some labeled 
training data. In the open-set problem, we also allow for 
the answer “none of the above”. We build upon this here 
with the authorship verification task, which is essentially 
an open-class authorship attribution problem with only 
one author in the candidate pool. Thus for a given docu-
ment D and candidate author A, we attempt to answer the 
question “Was D written by A?”. 
2 Background 
Previous approaches to this problem [1-2] have in-
volved the creation of a distractor set, which is normally 
controlled for genre, tone, length, etc. and performing an a 
traditional authorship attribution-style analysis to see 
whether the unlabeled document is more likely to be by 
the candidate author or one of the authors in the distractor 
set. This approach is not ideal because it relies heavily on 
the creation of an appropriate distractor set. That is, 
enough information was available about the candidate 
author and the training documents to choose a set of dis-
tractor authors that were appropriate for the task. Thus, 
although these methods performed well at the verification 
task, they do not lend themselves well to automation. 
Indeed, the entire result of this type of authorship verifica-
tion hinges upon the documents chosen for the distractor 
set. This creates a sort of chicken-and-egg problem where-
in it is necessary to know the answer in order to evaluate 
the suitability of the distractor set, yet it is necessary to 
know whether the distractor set is appropriate in order to 
evaluate the results.  
We will attempt to remedy the errors introduced by the 
distractor set by eliminating the set entirely. Instead, we 
will consider only the document in question as well as a 
sample of writing known to belong to the candidate au-
thor. Thus, the validity of the verification task hinges only 
on obtaining a representative model of the candidate au-
thor’s work, a requirement shared by traditional verifica-
tion tasks, and does not involve any guesswork.  
3 Materials and Methods 
3.1 Distractorless Authorship Verification 
Goal: Given a document D, and a candidate author A, 
determine the likelihood that D is written by A. 
Method: 
1. Compile a set of training data, which is known to be 
written by A. 
2. Compile a model from the training data. This is nor-
mally accomplished by extracting linguistic or token-
level features from the text and compiling a feature 
vector using any of various standard techniques from 
the authorship attribution field. We will label this fea-
ture vector M = <m1, m2, …, mn>. 
3. Extract a feature set, F, from D in the form of F = <f1, 
f2, …, fn>, where fi corresponds to mi for all i.  
4. Choose a “distance like” function, δ, such that if δ(x, y) 
> δ(x, z), we can say that x is “closer to” or “more simi-
lar to” y than to z (in some meaningful way). 
5. Choose a threshold, t, such that if δ(M, F) > t, we ac-
cept the premise that M and F are written by the same 
author, A. This threshold is found empirically by ana-
785
lyzing the average δ between documents of the same 
author. 
3.2 The Corpora 
To evaluate the performance of our authorship verifica-
tion algorithms, we used two publically-available corpora. 
We made use of the Ad-hoc Authorship Attribution Com-
petition corpus (AAAC) [3] and the PAN 2011 Author-
ship Identification Training Corpus [4]. 
Ad-hoc Authorship Attribution Competition Corpus 
The AAAC was an experiment in authorship attribution 
held as part of the 2004 Joint International Conference of 
the Association for Literary and Linguistic Computing 
and the Association for Computers and the Humanities. 
The AAAC provides texts from a wide variety of different 
genres, languages and document lengths, assuring that the 
results will be useful for a wide variety of applications. 
The AAAC corpus consists of 264 training documents, 98 
test documents and 63 authors, distributed across 13 dif-
ferent problems (labeled A-M). A description of each 
problem is found in Table 1. 
PAN 2011 Authorship Identification Training Corpus 
The PAN 2011 Authorship Identification Training 
Corpus consists of “real-world texts” (described by the 
originators as “often short and messy” [4]). These texts 
appear to come primarily from the Enron Email Dataset 
[5]. Each text contained authorship information within the 
text itself, which was removed during the preprocessing 
stage. They are included to ensure that the results obtained 
herein are applicable in real-world situations, and to avoid 
overtraining on the AAAC data. The PAN corpus con-
tained 5,064 training documents and 1,251 test documents 
across 10 authors.

3.3 Preprocessing 
Preprocessing was performed on the text based on cur-
rent best practices from traditional authorship attribution. 
Both corpora were preprocessed to standardize whitespace 
and character case. Any sequence of whitespace charac-
ters in the documents converted to a single space, and all 
characters were converted to lower case. As previously 
mentioned, for the PAN corpus, we also removed the 
author tags from each document. 
3.4 Features 
We used a variety of features, also chosen for their 
known performance in traditional authorship attribution, 
in our approach. Current research [6] shows that character 
n-grams are strong performers in traditional authorship 
attribution tasks. As such, we have focused on these fea-
tures, examining results for character n-grams for n from 
1 to 20. For completeness, we also provide results for 
word n-grams for n from 1 to 10. Here, a word is defined 
as any series of non-whitespace characters separated by 
whitespace. The n-grams are generated using a sliding 
window of size n and slide 1. We have limited ourselves 
to these simple features as they can be calculated very 
rapidly and without risk of error (such as that introduced 
by imperfect part-of-speech taggers), and thus lend them-
selves well to rapid, confident analysis.  
3.5 Author Model 
In order to perform the distractorless authorship verifi-
cation, it is necessary to accurately model the writing style 
of the candidate author. We accomplished this using the 
centroid of the feature vectors for each training document. 
The centroid was calculated by using the average relative 
frequency of each event across the training documents, to 
adjust for variations in training document length.  
3.6 Analysis Method 
For this study, we have limited ourselves to the use of a 
normalized dot-product (Cosine Distance) analysis me-
thod. This method was shown in [7] to be among the best 
performing and simplest methods for authorship attributi-
on. The advantage to using the Cosine Distance, particu-
larly in conjunction with the simple features described 
above, is that it is possible to perform this verification 
extremely quickly, even on very large data sets. In order 
786
to answer the verification task, we need only consider the 
dot product of the unknown document with the candidate 
author model. So, let:

5 Discussion and Conclusion 
These results are as expected, and show that distractor-
less authorship verification is a viable technique with high 
accuracy even on extremely difficult problems. The lower 
accuracy rates on the AAAC Corpus are expected, as this 
corpus contains many times more authors than the PAN 
corpus with fewer training documents per author. Despite 
this, we were able to achieve accuracy rates of up to 88% 
on this more difficult corpus, and 92% on the “easier” 
PAN corpus. 
It should be noted that the results of this technique are 
extremely tunable. For instance, we can tune for any com-
bination of accuracy, precision, recall and F-Score, as 
desired. That is, this distractorless authorship verification 
technique allows us to tune the Type I vs. Type II error 
rates depending on the application of the technology. For 
instance, in a forensic context we may want to err on the 
side of saying “no”, and thus prefer to reduce false posi-
tives, while in a less stringent application we may wish to 
improve the overall accuracy at a cost of possibly having 
more false positives. 
Given the performance on both the PAN corpus, which 
consisted mainly of real-life e-mail messages, and the 
AAAC corpus, which contained a wide variety of docu-
ments, the distractorless authorship verification technique 
shows promise for a wide range of genres and document 
lengths, and appears to work across a variety of lan-
guages, all without much tuning. Indeed, the only difficul-
ty appears to be in finding an appropriate threshold, t, for 
given candidate author. This is possible by analyzing the 
average δ between documents by the candidate author. It 
can also be approximated from a large corpus, as was 
done here, although these results make it clear that there 
will be some of the same problems in controlling the cor-
pus for genre, document length, etc. that were present in 
forming a distractor set for traditional authorship verifica-
tion.  
Future work will focus on improving these results, 
mainly through the addition of  confidence ratings for the 
verification answers. That is, by allowing the system to 
decline to answer some percentage of the verification

questions asked (or, effectively, to answer “I don’t 
know”), we have seen some improvement in these exper-
imental results. Although full results for this study are not 
yet available, we have seen that by dropping the 20% 
“most difficult” verification problems, we see an increase 
in accuracy to approximately 96% (from 92% on the strict 
binary problem). Whether or not this is truly an increase 
in accuracy depends upon the intended application of the 
technology, but we believe this future work will provide 
interesting results in application-specific tradeoffs, as 
described above. 
Overall, we believe we have shown this distractorless 
authorship verification to be a useful tool on the sty-
lometrist’s workbench. Although no tool is itself a pana-
cea, we are also planning efforts to combine this tech-
nique with a mixture-of-experts style voting system, ef-
fectively using multiple distance functions and feature 
sets on the same problem to increase confidence in our 
answer. Finally, we hope to both more fully explore the 
process of determining the appropriate threshold without 
the need for extraneous texts, and to find an acceptable 
“default” threshold for cases where there is little training 
data. We have found enough similarity in the highest ac-
curacy and highest F-Score thresholds that we believe a 
threshold point may exist that, despite being slightly less 
accurate than application-specific thresholds, will perform 
adequately across a wide range of documents.
