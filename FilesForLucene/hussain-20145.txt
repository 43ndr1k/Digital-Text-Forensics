Abstract
Handwriting has remained one of the most frequently occurring patterns that we come across in everyday life.
Handwriting offers a number of interesting pattern classification problems including handwriting recognition, writer
identification, signature verification, writer demographics classification and script recognition, etc. Research in these
and similar related problems requires the availability of handwritten samples for validation of the developed
techniques and algorithms. Like any other scientific domain, the handwriting recognition community has developed
a large number of standard databases allowing development, evaluation and comparison of different techniques
developed for a variety of recognition tasks. This paper is intended to provide a comprehensive survey of the
handwriting databases developed during the last two decades. In addition to the statistics of the discussed databases,
we also present a comparison of these databases on a number of dimensions. The ground truth information of the
databases along with the supported tasks is also discussed. It is expected that this paper would not only allow
researchers in handwriting recognition to objectively compare different databases but will also provide them the
opportunity to select the most appropriate database(s) for evaluation of their developed systems.

1 Review
The availability of databases is a fundamental requirement
for development and evaluation in all scientific research
domains. Standard datasets provide a platform for com-
parison and evaluation of different techniques on the
same grid thus abstracting any possible bias [1, 2]. The
task of collecting samples for database development is nat-
urally cumbersome and tedious as it involves getting a
maximum possible variety of samples from sundry par-
ticipants. Having standard databases not only prevents
the researchers from compiling the databases but also
provides them with an opportunity to have an objec-
tive as well as comparative performance evaluation of
their developed systems. Benchmark construction is not
just the accumulation of samples, but an organized pro-
cess of cull and abnegation of samples to be included

Full list of author information is available at the end of the article
in the database. Like any other scientific domain, docu-
ment analysis and recognition community (DAR) has also
developed a large number of document databases. The
most researched and significant task in document analy-
sis and recognition is handwriting recognition. Naturally,
most of the standard databases developed by the docu-
ment recognition community are handwritten databases.
The process of development of handwritten databases is
as old as the problem of document analysis and recogni-
tion itself. This development of standard databases started
to receive a notable attention in the early 1990s and
the process still continues. Most important and widely
used handwritten databases include IAM [2–4], RIMES
[5], NIST [6], MNIST [7], CENPARMI [8–13], CEDAR
[14], UNIPEN [15], ETL9 [16] and PE92 databases [17].
Although most of these databases have been developed
using text in languages based on the Latin alphabet, devel-
opment of databases in Chinese [18], Korean [17], Arabic
[13, 19–22], Farsi [10, 12, 23, 24] and Indian scripts [25]
is also on the rise. The trend of multi-script handwrit-
ten databases [26, 27] has also been observed in the last

few years. These handwritten databases comprise a variety
of samples including handwritten digits [6, 7, 13, 21, 28],
characters [14, 17, 29–31], words [13, 14, 19, 21, 23, 24,
28], or complete sentences [3, 5, 18, 26, 27]. A step ahead
to benchmark construction is the organization of evalu-
ation campaigns and competitions allowing researchers
to compare their systems under the same experimental
setups.
This paper is intended to provide a comprehensive sur-
vey of the handwritten databases developed during the
last two decades. We not only discuss the statistics of
these databases but also present a comparative analysis on
different dimensions including the size of database, num-
ber of contributors, textual content of the database, data
acquisition mode (online or offline), writing script and
the tasks which could be evaluated on a given database.
This study is likely to be helpful for researchers in select-
ing the most appropriate databases for evaluation of their
developed systems. We first discuss the basics of hand-
writing benchmarks in Section 2 followed by a detailed
review of the well-known handwritten databases, their
structure and usage in Section 3. Section 4 provides an
overview of the evaluation campaigns and competitions
organized using these databases while the last section con-
cludes the paper with a discussion on future trends on the
subject.
2 Handwriting benchmarks: basics
Research in handwriting recognition and related problems
has been carried out in online as well as offline domains.
Benchmarks have, therefore, been developed both for
offline and online analysis of handwriting. Offline samples
of handwriting are collected by making individuals write
on paper with a typical writing instrument (pen or a pen-
cil) and digitizing the paper documents using a scanner.
Online databases of handwriting are produced by requir-
ing the subjects to directly write on a digitizing tablet
or similar devices. Writing is produced using a stylus or
directly through finger. In addition to the writing strokes
in terms of x-y coordinates of the pen position, online
handwriting also contains additional information includ-
ing pen pressure, writing speed, stroke order, etc. Offline
datasets of handwritten text may comprise alphanumeric
characters, isolated words, or complete paragraphs. Gen-
erally, these databases are produced by requiring the sub-
jects to fill standardized forms with already specified or
an arbitrary text. These forms are then scanned into a
digital format. Online handwriting databases also com-
prise isolated characters, words, or sentences. Since the
collection of online data requires the subjects to directly
produce their samples on digitizing devices, online data
collection is generally considered relatively easier but nat-
urally requires specialized hardware for acquisition of
samples.
The next step after data collection is the labeling of data
to produce the ground truth. The ground truth associ-
ated with a database determines the tasks that could be
evaluated using the database. Labeling is generally car-
ried out at character, word, or line levels to support the
traditional preprocessing, segmentation and recognition
tasks. In addition, some databases also support evalua-
tion of tasks like document layout analysis, word spotting,
writer demographics classification, writer identification
and writer verification.
The next section presents a detailed discussion on
the handwritten databases developed during the last two
decades.
3 Handwriting benchmarks survey: structure and
usage
A large number of handwritten benchmark datasets sup-
porting the evaluation of a variety of preprocessing, seg-
mentation and recognition tasks have been developed
over the years. These database could be categorized
on different dimensions including the data acquisition
method (online or offline), script, size, or the types of
tasks supported. In our discussion, we have grouped
the databases as a function of the script of the writ-
ing samples. These include the databases of Roman/Latin
script, Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK) writings cov-
ering East Asian languages, Arabic and Arabic-like scripts
and different Indian scripts. The handwritten databases
developed in each of these scripts are discussed in the
following.
3.1 Databases in the Roman script
The Roman or Latin script is the most widely used writ-
ing system based on the letters of classical Latin alpha-
bet. With minor variations, Roman script covers English,
French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Swedish and Dutch
languages. Some other languages have also migrated to
this script, Malaysian and Indonesian being the most
notable of these. Consequently, a significant proportion
of the handwritten databases comprise text in the Roman
script. The following sections discuss in detail the well-
known handwriting databases in the Roman script.
3.1.1 IAM databases
The IAM databases are easily the most widely used col-
lections of handwritten samples employed for a variety of
segmentation and recognition tasks. A number of offline
and online databases have been developed under the IAM
umbrella as discussed in the following.
IAM-DB:IAM handwriting database The IAM Hand-
writing Database [2, 3] comprises handwritten samples in
English which can be used to evaluate systems like text
Hussain et al. EURASIP Journal on Image and Video Processing  (2015) 2015:46 Page 3 of 24
segmentation, handwriting recognition, writer identifica-
tion and writer verification. The database is developed
on Lancaster-Oslo/Bergen Corpus and comprises forms
where the contributors copied a given text in their natural
unconstrained handwriting. Each form was subsequently
scanned at 300 dpi and saved as gray level (8-bit) PNG
image. A complete filled form, sample lines of text and
some words extracted from a sample form in the database
are illustrated in Fig. 1. The IAM Handwriting Database
3.0 includes contributions from 657 writers making a total
of 1539 handwritten pages comprising 5685 sentences,
13,353 text lines and 115,320 words. The database is
labeled at sentence, line and word levels. The database has
been widely used in word spotting [32–35], writer identi-
fication [36–40], handwritten text segmentation [41–43]
and offline handwriting recognition [44–47].
IAM On-Line Handwriting Database (IAM-OnDB)
IAM-OnDB [4] is a collection of online handwritten sam-
ples on a white board acquired with the E-Beam System.
Data is stored in xml-format which, in addition to the
transcription of text, also contains information on writ-
ers and writer demographics. The database comprises 221
writers contributing a total of more than 1700 forms with
13,049 labeled text lines and 86,272 word instances from
a dictionary of 11,059 words. In addition to recognition
of online handwriting [48, 49], the database has also been
employed for online writer identification [50] and gender
classification from handwriting [51].
IAM Online Document Database (IAM on-Do) The
IAM on-Do [52] is a relatively new database of online
handwritten documents containing text, drawings, dia-
grams, formulas, tables, lists and markings as indicated in
Fig. 2. The database can be employed for document layout
analysis and different segmentation and recognition tasks.
The database consists of 1000 documents produced by
approximately 200 writers. Few constraints were imposed
on the writers while creating the documents. Nonetheless,
the database has a stable distribution of the different con-
tent types and presents a collection of samples close to
those encountered in real-world scenarios. The database
has been employed formode (content type) detection [53],
keyword spotting [54] and classification of text/non-text
objections [55].

IAM Historical Document Database (IAM-HistDB)
The IAM-HistDB is a repository comprising handwrit-
ten historical manuscript images together with ground
truth data. The IAM-HistDB currently includes Saint Gall
Database [56] of ninth century containing manuscripts
written by a single writer in Carolingian script. The orig-
inal manuscript is housed at the Abbey Library of Saint
Gall, Switzerland. The manuscript images are made avail-
able online by the E-codices (Virtual Manuscript Library
of Switzerland) project and a text edition was attached
at page-level by the Monumenta project. IAM addition-
ally added binarized and normalized text line images
to the manuscript data. Altogether, the manuscript data
contains page images (jpeg, 300 dpi), binarized and nor-
malized text line images and text edition at page-level
(word spelling, capitalization, punctuations, etc.). These
images have been employed for text-line segmentation
[57, 58], binarization [59, 60], keyword spotting [34, 61]
and handwriting recognition [62].
3.1.2 RIMES
RIMES [5, 63] is a representative database of an industrial
application. Themain idea of developing this database was
to collect handwritten samples similar to those that are
sent to different companies by individuals. Each contribu-
tor was assigned a fictitious identity and a maximum of up
to five different scenarios from a set of nine themes. These
themes included real-world scenarios like ‘damage dec-
laration’ or ‘modification of contract’. The subjects were
required to compose a letter for a given scenario using
their own words and layout on a white paper using black
ink. A total of 1300 volunteers contributed to data collec-
tion providing 12,723 pages corresponding to 5605 mails.
Each mail contains two to three pages including the let-
ter written by the contributor, a form with information
about the letter and an optional fax sheet. The pages were
scanned, and the complete database was annotated to
support evaluation of tasks like document layout analysis
[64, 65], mail classification [66], handwriting recognition
[67–72] and writer recognition [38, 73].
3.1.3 NIST: handwriting sample image databases
The National Institute of Standards and Technology,
NIST, developed a series of databases [6] of handwrit-
ten characters and digits supporting tasks like isolation of
fields, detection and removal of boxes in forms, character
segmentation and recognition. A sample form from the
database is illustrated in Fig. 3. The form comprises boxes
containing writer information, 28 boxes for numbers and
2 for alphabets while 1 box for a paragraph of text. The
NIST Special Database 1 comprised samples contributed
by 2100 writers. The latest version of the database, the
Hussain et al. EURASIP Journal on Image and Video Processing  (2015) 2015:46 Page 5 of 24
Fig. 3 A sample filled form from the NIST database [6]
Special Database 19, comprises handwritten forms of 3600
writers with 810,000 isolated character images along with
ground truth information. This database has been widely
employed in a variety of handwritten digit [74–77] and
character recognition systems [78–81].
3.1.4 MNIST: a database of handwritten digits
MNIST is a large collection of handwritten digits [7] with
a training set of 60,000 and a test of 10,000 samples.
MNIST is a subset of the NIST database discussed ear-
lier and is composed of samples from the NIST Special
Database 3 (SD-3) and Special Database 1 (SD-1). Initially,
SD-3 was proposed to be employed as training and SD-
1 as test set. However, samples in SD-3 were contributed
by the employees of the Census Bureau while those of
SD-1 were written by high school students. As a result,
SD-1 offered more challenges in terms of recognition as
opposed to SD-3. To ensure uniform distribution of sam-
ples from SD-1 and SD-3 in training and test sets, the
MNIST database was compiled with a training set of
30,000 images from SD-1 and 30,000 from SD-3. In a simi-
lar fashion, the test set comprised 5000 samples each from
SD-1 and SD-3 databases. The database has been exten-
sively employed in a number of digit recognition systems
[82–87].
3.1.5 CEDAR databases
The Center of Excellence for Document Analysis and
Recognition (CEDAR), at the State University of New
York at Buffalo, has developed a number of handwritten
databases [14] including handwritten words, ZIP codes,
digits and alphanumeric characters. These databases were
mainly intended to support research in automatic pro-
cessing of postal addresses on the envelopes. The samples
Hussain et al. EURASIP Journal on Image and Video Processing  (2015) 2015:46 Page 6 of 24
contain 5632 city words, 4938 state words and 9454 ZIP
codes. This makes a total of 27,835 alphanumeric char-
acters segmented from address blocks and 21,179 digits
segmented from ZIP codes. The words in the database are
divided into separate subsets for training and test. This
database has been used for the evaluation of a number of
systems including handwriting segmentation [88, 89], cur-
sive digit recognition [74, 90–92] character recognition
[90, 93, 94] and word segmentation [95] and recognition
[96–98].
3.1.6 IRONOFF: the IRESTE on/off dual handwriting
database
The Institute de Recherche et d’Enseignement Supérieur
aux Techniques de l’Electronique, IRESTE, developed a
dual on/off database [99], named IRONOFF. The database
comprises handwritten samples of French writers includ-
ing characters, digits and words. The contributors were
required to fill forms having predefined boxes, and the
ground truth information and the filled forms were later
inspected by human operators. Each contributor filled
three types of forms which have been named as B, C and
D. The information on form B includes the lower- and
uppercase letters of the alphabet, digits, the Euro sym-
bol and the frequently occurring strings in French checks.
Forms C and D comprise cursive words in French. The
database contains a total of 1000 forms with 32,000 iso-
lated characters and 50,000 cursive words. The online
collection of these images is stored in UNIPEN format at
a sampling rate of 100 points/second. The database has
been employed in a variety of recognition tasks [100–103]
as well as online writer identification [104].
3.1.7 The RODRIGO database
RODRIGO [105] is one of the very large databases con-
taining diverse samples of historical manuscripts in Span-
ish. The RODRIGO database was generated from an old
manuscript (of 1545) written in old Castilian (Spanish)
by a single author. The writing style is mainly influenced
from the Gothic style. The database is spread on 853
pages and is further divided into 307 chapters describing
chronicles from the Spanish history. Each page contains a
well-separated single text block of calligrapher handwrit-
ing. The complete manuscript was digitized by the experts
of Spanish ministry of culture in 300 dpi with true colors.
The database can be employed for research on historical
manuscripts [106–108].
3.1.8 Indonesian handwritten text database
A database of Indonesian handwritten text [109] was com-
piled to support recognition and segmentation tasks. The
database was developed by writing samples contributed
by college students making a total of 200 scanned forms.
These forms comprise isolated and cursive digits, isolated
upper- and lowercase characters and words and can be
employed for evaluation of a number of recognition tasks.
3.1.9 Database for bank-check processing
A recent database for evaluation of check processing
and word recognition systems is presented in [110]. The
database comprises cursive words in English, courtesy
amounts and signatures. The ground truth of the database
is developed in XML and, in addition to transcription of
text, also contains the identity of the contributing writers.
The database can be employed for recognition of words as
well as verification of signatures.
3.1.10 IBMUB database
The IBM UB database [111] developed at the Center for
Unified Biometrics and Sensors (CUBS) at the Univer-
sity at Buffalo is a multi-lingual online/offline database of
handwritten samples. The writing samples include para-
graphs of free text, filled forms, words, isolated characters
and symbols. Writing samples were collected on IBM’s
CrossPad with an electronic pen which simultaneously
produced ink on the paper and captured the trajectory of
the pen. The online data is available in the InkML for-
mat while the offline images are scanned as ‘png’ files. The
database is divided into two parts, IBM UB 1 and IBM UB
2. The IBM UB 1 comprises cursive handwritten texts in
English with more than 6500 online pages collected from
43 writers and around 6000 offline pages contributed by
41 writers. The IBM UB 2 contains short phrases, digits
and isolated characters in French produced by 200 writ-
ers. The database has been used for online handwriting
recognition [112] and writer identification tasks [113].
3.1.11 CVL Database
CVL [27] is a database of handwritten samples supporting
handwriting recognition, word spotting and writer recog-
nition. The database comprises seven different hand-
written texts, one in German and six in English. A
total of 310 volunteers contributed to data collection
with 27 authors producing 7 and 283 writers provid-
ing 5 pages each. The ground truth data is available in
XML format which includes transcription of text, the
bounding box of each word and the identity of writer.
The database has been used for writer recognition and
retrieval [114] and can also be employed for other recogni-
tion tasks. A sample image from the database is shown in
Fig. 4.
In addition to text, a database of handwritten digit
strings contributed by 303 students has also been com-
piled [115]. Each writer provided 26 different digit strings
of different lengths making a total of 7800 samples. Iso-
lated digits were extracted from the database to form a
separate dataset—the CVL Single Digit Dataset. The Sin-
gle Digit Dataset comprises 3578 samples for each of the
digit classes (0-9). A subset of this database has also been

used in the ICDAR 2013 digit recognition competition
[115].
3.1.12 Firemaker Database
The Firemaker database [116] comprises handwritten
samples of 250 Dutch individuals with 4 samples per
writer making a total of 1000 writing samples. Each writer
copied a given text in the normal writing style on page 1
while on page 2 the writers copied the given text using
only uppercase letters. Page 3 of each writer comprised
‘forged’ text whereas on page 4 the writers provided their
own text describing the contents of a given cartoon. All
pages were scanned at 300 dpi as gray-scale images. The
database has been mainly employed for evaluation of
writer identification and verification systems [37, 117].
3.2 Databases in the Arabic and Arabic-like scripts
Arabic is the second most widely used script after Roman
and supports languages like Arabic, Urdu, Pashto and
Farsi. The initial research in document analysis and recog-
nition mainly focused on text in Roman scripts only and it
was relatively late that Arabic and other Arabic-like scripts
started to receive notable research interest. During the
last decade, however, significant research has been carried
out on Arabic handwriting recognition and other related
tasks. Consequently, a significant number of Arabic and
similar databases have been developed in the recent years.
We present an overview of well-known handwritten Ara-
bic and Arabic-like databases in the following sections.
3.2.1 IFN/ENIT
The IFN/ENIT database [19] comprises handwritten Ara-
bic words representing names of towns and villages in
Tunisia along with the postal code of each. The database
has been developed by contributions from 411 volunteers
each filling a specified form. The total words (city/town
names) in the database sum up to 26,400 correspond-
ing to 210,000 characters. The ground truth data with
the database includes information on the sequence of
character shapes, baseline and the writer. All filled forms
were digitized at 300 dpi and stored as binary images.
The database mainly targets preprocessing [118–120] and
recognition of Arabic handwritten words [121–126] but
has also been employed to evaluate writer identification
systems [127–129]. Figure 5 illustrates a town name from
the database written by 12 different writers.
3.2.2 The Arabic Database: ADAB
The online Arabic database ADAB was jointly developed
by the Institut Fuer Nachrichtentechnik (IFN) and the
Hussain et al. EURASIP Journal on Image and Video Processing  (2015) 2015:46 Page 8 of 24
Fig. 5 Examples from the IFN/ENIT-database: a town/village name written by 12 different writers [19]
Research Group on Intelligent Machines (REGIM) aiming
to support research in online Arabic handwriting recog-
nition. Writing samples were collected from 170 writers
making a total of more than 20,000 Arabic words. The
database is also accompanied with a tool which allows
not only online data collection but also data verification
and correction of erroneous data. The database has been
employed in a number of segmentation and recognition
studies [130–133] as well as for online writer identification
[133, 134].
3.2.3 Arabic Handwriting Database: AHDB
The AHDB [20, 135] is an offline database of Arabic hand-
writing together with several pre-processing procedures.
It contains Arabic handwritten paragraphs, words and the
words used to represent numbers on checks produced by
100 different writers. The database was mainly intended
to support automatic processing of bank checks, but it
also contains pages of unconstrained text (as indicated
in Fig. 6) allowing evaluation of generic Arabic hand-
writing recognition systems as well. The database can
be employed in handwriting recognition [136] and writer
identification tasks [137].
3.2.4 Arabic checks database
This database has been developed to advance research in
automatic recognition and processing of Arabic checks
[13]. The database comprises a collection of 7000 images
of checks containing about 30,000 sub-words and more
than 15,000 digits. A sample check from the database
is shown in Fig. 7. The database can be employed for
evaluation of automatic check processing and recognition
systems [138].
3.2.5 The ARABASE
ARABASE [139] is a rich database for online as well as
offline handwriting recognition. The database also sup-
ports recognition of offline machine printed Arabic text.
The database includes complete paragraphs, words, iso-
lated characters, digits and signatures. The database is
also accompanied with a tool supporting traditional doc-
ument analysis tasks on the database. The database can
be employed for evaluation of (online/offline) handwriting
recognition and signature verification systems.
3.2.6 CENPARMI Arabic handwriting database
The CENPARMI Arabic database [11] for offline Arabic
handwriting recognition comprises isolated digits, letters,
numerical strings and words. To support data acquisition,
a two-page form was designed that was filled by 100 par-
ticipants from Canada and 228 participants from Saudi
Arabia. These forms comprised a sample Arabic date, 2
samples each of 20 digits, 38 numerical strings, 35 iso-
lated letters and 70 Arabic words. The database is split
into three sets. The first set comprises the forms of first
100 writers while the second set contains the forms filled
by 228 writers. The third set is a combination of samples
from set 1 and set 2. The database has been used for recog-
nition of Arabic characters [140] and numerals [141] as
well as word spotting [142].

3.2.7 IBN-E-SINA database
The IBN-E-SINA database [143] is developed on a
manuscript provided by the Institute of Islamic Stud-
ies (IIS), McGill University, Montreal. The database is
a part of the RaSI project which is aimed at creating a
large-scale database of Islamic philosophical and scientific
manuscripts, mostly written in Arabic with some con-
tributions in Persian and Turkish. The document images
were obtained using camera imaging (21 mega-pixels) at
a resolution of 300 dpi. The selected dataset consists of
51 folios which correspond to 20,722 connected compo-
nents (almost 500 CCs on each folio). The database has
been used in a variety of interesting research problems on
historical manuscripts [144, 145].
3.2.8 Al-Isra Arabic Database
The Al-Isra Database [21] is a large collection of
handwritten samples containing words, digits, signa-
tures and sentences compiled by researchers at the
University of British Columbia. The samples were gath-
ered from 500 students at Al-Isra University, Jordan.
Each student produced a preselected list of words, dig-
its and phrases. The database comprises 500 uncon-
strained Arabic sentences, 37,000 words, 10,000 digits
and 2500 signatures. The database can be employed
for handwriting recognition and writer identification
tasks.
3.2.9 LMCA database
The On/Off LMCA (“Lettres, Mots et Chiffres Arabe” in
French) is a dual Arabic database comprising characters,
words and digits [22]. The database includes samples of 55
participants making a total of 500 words and 30,000 digits.
The database is compiled in the UNIPEN format [15], the
same as that of IRONOFF [99] database. The database can
be used for online as well as offline recognition of Arabic
words and digits.
3.2.10 KHATT database
KHATT [146, 147] is a comprehensive database of Ara-
bic handwritten text comprising 1000 forms produced by
same number of writers from different countries. Each
form is scanned at three different resolutions, 200, 300
and 600 dpi. The textual content of the database com-
prises 2000 paragraphs randomly picked from multiple
sources. The ground truth of the database is provided in
xml format and includes the transcription of text at line
and paragraph levels. The information about the writer of
each sample is also stored. The database is also accompa-
nied with tools that allow segmentation of text images into
lines and paragraphs. In addition to recognition of hand-
writing, the database supports evaluation of a number of
pre-processing and segmentation tasks as well as writer
identification systems.
3.2.11 QUWI database
The Qatar University Writer Identification (QUWI) [148]
database is a comprehensive collection of writing sam-
ples of 1017 writers of different cultural and educational
backgrounds. A unique feature of this database is that it
is a bi-script database where each author contributed four
pages, two in English and two in Arabic. This allows using
this database in a number of interesting writer identifi-
cation scenarios. Another feature of this database is that
page 1 and page 3 for each writer contains an arbitrary text
from the writer’s own imagination in Arabic and English,
respectively, while page 2 and page 4 of each writer com-
prises a fixed predefined text (in Arabic and English). This
allows the database to be used in text-independent as
well as text-dependent evaluation scenarios. The database
Hussain et al. EURASIP Journal on Image and Video Processing  (2015) 2015:46 Page 10 of 24
was mainly developed to support evaluation of writer
identification [149] and writer demographic classification
systems [150–152] but can also be used for handwriting
recognition and similar related tasks.
3.2.12 AHTID/MW
The Arabic Handwritten Text Images Database by Mul-
tiple Writers (AHTID/MW) [153] has been developed
to support research in the Arabic handwriting segmen-
tation and recognition. In addition, the database can
also be employed to evaluate the writer identification
systems. The database comprises 3710 text lines and
22,896 words contributed by 53 different native writ-
ers of Arabic and is supported by the ground truth
annotations. The database has been employed for eval-
uation of segmentation [154] and writer identification
tasks [155].
3.2.13 IAUT/PHCN database
The IAUT/PHCN Database [24] is a collection of hand-
written words representing Persian city names. The
database was compiled using 1140 forms filled by 380
individuals. The database comprises a total of 200,000
characters and the ground truth includes Unicodes of
characters in the city name and baseline information.
All forms were scanned at 300 dpi and stored as
binary images. The database has been mainly designed
to support Farsi word recognition and preprocessing
tasks [156–158].
3.2.14 IFN Farsi database
Inspired by the IFN/ENIT Arabic database [19], the IFN
Farsi database [23] was developed which comprises more
than 7000 images for about 1080 Iranian city/provinces
names. A total of 600 individuals contributed to data
collection where each writer filled a maximum of two
forms with 24 city/province names and their respective
postcodes. The ground truth data, in addition to the
transcription of text, comprises information on sequence
and number of characters, dots and partial words. The
database can be used to evaluate Farsi handwritten word
and digit recognition systems.
3.2.15 CENPARMI Farsi database
The Center for Pattern Recognition and Machine Intel-
ligence (CENPARMI) Farsi database [10] has been
developed to support research in handwriting recog-
nition and word spotting on Farsi text. The database
is compiled from 400 native Farsi writers and com-
prises 432,357 images with dates, words, isolated let-
ters, digits and numeral strings. Each image is provided
in gray scale as well as binarized form. The database
has been employed in evaluation of symbol/digit recog-
nition [159] as well as Farsi handwriting recognition
[160, 161].
3.2.16 FHT: Farsi handwritten text database
FHT database [162] is a repository of unconstrained hand-
written texts produced by 250 participants who filled
1000 forms containing Farsi text. The database includes
a total of 106,600 handwritten Farsi words, 230,175 sub-
words and 8050 sentences. Due to its diverse nature, FHT
database can be used to evaluate a wide variety of systems
including recognition of words and subwords, segmenta-
tion of words into characters, baseline detection, machine
printed and handwritten textual content discrimination,
writer identification and document layout analysis.
3.2.17 HaFT: Farsi text database
HaFT [163] is a large collection of unconstrained Farsi
handwritten documents produced by 600 different writ-
ers. Each writer contributed three samples at different
intervals of time and each sample comprises eight lines of
text. This makes a total of 1800 handwritten text images.
The database is mainly designed for training and evalu-
ation of Farsi writer identification and writer verification
systems but can also be used for different recognition and
segmentation tasks.
3.2.18 CENPARMI Urdu database
The CENPARMI Urdu handwritten database [164] com-
prises Urdu words, characters, digits and numeral strings.
A number of native Urdu speakers from different parts
of the world contributed to the data collection process.
The lexicon of 57 Urdu words and 44 Urdu characters
mainly comprises financial terms to support recognition
of offline Urdu words, characters and digits. This is the
first published database on Urdu handwriting and has
been employed in recognition and spotting of Urdu hand-
written words [165, 166].
3.2.19 Urdu handwritten sentence database
A relatively new database of unconstrained Urdu hand-
written text along with few pre-processing and segmen-
tation algorithms is presented in [167]. The database
comprises 400 forms filled by 200 different writers by
copying the text given on each form. The forms were
generated by taking text from six different categories of
news with each category having up to 70 forms. The
ground truth of the database includes transcription of
text, information on lines and the identity of the writer.
The database can be employed for recognition of Urdu
text, line segmentation and writer identification.
3.3 CJK databases
CJK, the Chinese, Japanese and Korean, are the main
East Asian languages. The writing systems of these lan-
guages partially or completely use the Chinese characters
Hanzi, Kanji or Hanza. To facilitate research in differ-
ent areas of handwriting recognition in these languages,
a number of standard databases have been developed
Hussain et al. EURASIP Journal on Image and Video Processing  (2015) 2015:46 Page 11 of 24
and distributed. We discuss the notable databases in the
following sections.
3.3.1 PE92: handwritten Korean character image database
PE92 [17] is a very large and unique database comprising
100 handwritten image sets of 2350 Hangeul characters
(Fig. 8). More than 500 writers contributed to the gener-
ation of first 70 sets while the last 30 sets were produced
by one person. Writers filled pre-defined forms by writing
characters in specified boxes. The database has been used
in a variety of recognition tasks [168–170].
3.3.2 Online Japanese character pattern database
A database of online Japanese character patterns [31, 171]
was compiled to support research in Japanese charac-
ter recognition systems. These characters were extracted
from unconstrained textual phrases provided by 80 writ-
ers. The text was collected from Japanese newspapers and
produced 1227 frequently occurring Japanese character
categories. The patterns weremanually inspected and cor-
rected to remove errors and wrongly written characters.
The database has been used in a number of online charac-
ter recognition systems [172–175].
3.3.3 HCL-2000 Database
HCL-2000 [176, 177] is a large collection of frequently
used Chinese characters produced by 1000 writers. In
addition to the ground truth information of 3755 charac-
ters, information about the writers, their age and gender
is also stored allowing evaluation of writer identifica-
tion or demographic classification systems. The database
has been employed in a number of Chinese character
recognition systems [178–180]
3.3.4 SCUT-COUCH2009: online unconstrained Chinese
handwriting database
The SCUT online handwriting Chinese character recog-
nition database, SCUT-COUCH2009 [181] is a revision
and an enhanced version of SCUT-COUCH2008 [182]
database. The database contains 11 datasets of diverse
kinds of vocabularies and has been mainly developed
to facilitate research in unconstrained online Chinese
Fig. 8 Handwritten samples PE92 Korean character image database [17]
Hussain et al. EURASIP Journal on Image and Video Processing  (2015) 2015:46 Page 12 of 24
handwriting recognition. The database comprises individ-
ual Chinese characters in different standards, complete
Chinese words and isolated symbols. The total character
count in the database is more than 3.6 million. A sample
image from the database is shown in Fig. 9. All the samples
were gathered using PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants)
and smart phone devices with touch screens and a total
of 190 different individuals contributed to data collection.
This database was the first publicly available large online
Chinese handwriting database and has been employed
in a number of online handwriting recognition tasks
[183–186].
3.3.5 CASIA: online and offline Chinese handwriting
databases
CASIA [187, 188] is a widely used Chinese handwritten
database comprising handwritten paragraphs as well as
isolated characters The data was collected from 1020 indi-
viduals who produced writings on paper with a digital pen.
This allowed capturing the online trajectory information
as well as the offline images of text. The database was
divided into six subsets, three comprising isolated char-
acters (DB 1.0–1.2) and three having handwritten para-
graphs (DB 2.0–2.2). The datasets of isolated characters
comprise a total of about 3.9 million Chinese charac-
ters while the datasets of text (paragraphs) contain about
1.35 million characters. This database has been employed
in a number of recognition [189–192] word spotting
tasks [193].
3.3.6 Touching character database
In order to assess character segmentation algorithms, a
database of touching Chinese characters was compiled
from the CASIA handwriting database [187, 188]. This
database was termed as CASIA-HWDB-T [194]. The
database includes more than 56,000 strings with two or
more touching characters. More than 1800 strings com-
prise multiple touching characters. The database is also
divided into interesting subsets like strings comprising all
Chinese characters, mixed strings and digits. The ground
truth data includes information on character classes and
locations of touching points. This database can be used
for character segmentation [195, 196] and recognition of
broken or touching characters.
3.4 Databases in Indian scripts
Significant research has been carried out on document
analysis and recognition problems in different Indian
scripts. Several hundred languages are spoken and writ-
ten in India with Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, Bengali, Kannada
and Gujrati being the popular ones. Some of the languages
share common scripts while others have unique scripts of
their own.Well-known Indian scripts include Devanagari,
Telugu, Tamil and Kannada. These diverse scripts offer
a variety of interesting and challenging problems to the
document recognition community. Despite a rich diver-
sity of scripts and languages, the number of standard
databases on Indian scripts is relatively small. We discuss
the databases developed on different Indian scripts in the
following sections.
3.4.1 Handwritten numeral databases of Indian scripts
A large database of handwritten numerals in two popu-
lar Hindi scripts is presented in [197]. The database was
compiled by collecting numerals from postal mails and
job application forms in Devanagari and Bangla scripts. A
total of 22,556 Devanagari numerals were collected from
368 postal mails and 274 job application forms. In a similar
fashion, 23,392 Bangla numerals were collected from 465
mails and 268 job applications. All images were digitized
at 300 dpi and saved as gray scale ‘tif ’ images. The database
has been used to evaluate a number of digit recognition
systems [25, 198–200].
3.4.2 Kannada handwritten document dataset
The Kannada Handwritten Text Database (KHTD) [201]
comprises 204 writing samples in a popular Indian script
Kannada. The database has been developed by collect-
ing writing samples from 51 native speakers of Kannada,
and the textual content comes from four different cate-
gories. The database has a total of more than 4000 lines
of text and 26,000 words. The database can be employed
Fig. 9 Handwritten samples from the SCUT-COUCH 2009 Database [181]
Hussain et al. EURASIP Journal on Image and Video Processing  (2015) 2015:46 Page 13 of 24
in a number of segmentation and recognition tasks at line,
word or character levels.
3.4.3 A database of Tamil handwritten city names
A database of handwritten city names in Tamil, a pop-
ular script in India and Sri Lanka, is presented in [202].
The database includes a total of 265 different city names
with 109 cities from Indian state of Tamil Nadu and 156
cities from Sri Lanka. Each city name has 100 instances in
the database and a total of 500 writers with different edu-
cational backgrounds contributed to data collection. The
database is also accompanied with algorithms to automat-
ically segment city names from the image. Out of the 265
city names, 258 comprise only 1 word, 5 names include
2 words and 2 names contain 3 words with an average of
7 characters per city name. The database can be used for
recognition of handwritten Tamil words.
3.4.4 Devanagari numeral and character database
A database comprising Devanagari numerals and charac-
ters is presented in [203]. Writing samples of 750 individ-
uals belonging to different educational backgrounds, ages
and professions were collected. The database comprises a
total of 5137 isolated numerals and 20,305 isolated char-
acters stored as binary ‘tif ’ images. The database has been
made available publically and can be used for recognition
of Devanagari characters
3.5 Miscellaneous
After having discussed the handwritten databases in
Roman, Arabic, CJK and Indian scripts, we now present
few other databases in the following.
3.5.1 AMHCD: a database for Amazigh handwritten
character recognition research
This database has been developed to support research
activities on Amazigh text. Amazigh is spoken by mil-
lions of people in Africa mostly for oral communication.
The Moroccan government took the initiative to promote
Amazigh in mass media as well as the educational sys-
tem. As a part of these efforts, the IRF-SIC Laboratory at
the Ibn Zohr University, Morocco developed the AMHCD
database [204] comprising a total of 25,740 isolated char-
acters contributed by 60 different writers (Fig. 10). Each
author produced 13 examples of each Amazigh charac-
ter. The collected documents are scanned at 2400 dpi and
are stored as colored ‘jpeg’ images. The database mainly
targets the recognition system for handwritten Amazigh
characters [205, 206].
3.5.2 GRUHD: database of Greek unconstrained
handwriting
The GRUHD [29] database is a huge collection of uncon-
strained Greek text. The database includes sentences,
characters, digits and other symbols. The writings have
Fig. 10 A filled form in the AMHCD database [204]
been produced by 1000 writers with equal distribution of
male and female writers. The database comprises 1760
forms having 667,583 symbols and 102,692 words. The
database has been employed for character/symbol recog-
nition [207–209] and discrimination of machine-printed
and handwritten texts [210].
3.5.3 MRG-OHTC database
MRG-OHTC [211] is a collection of online Tibetan
writings facilitating research in online Tibetan charac-
ter recognition. A total of 130 Tibetan writers pro-
duced the database comprising 910 Tibetan characters
from the basic and extended Tibetan character set. The
writing samples are collected on a digital tablet using
an electronic pen. The database has been employed
for evaluation of Tibetan character recognition systems
[212, 213].
3.6 Discussion

• Content of writing (sentences, words, characters or
digits)
• Handwriting mode (online or offline)
• Language or script
• Total number of writers
• Total number of samples
• Problems on which databases could be employed
It can be observed from Table 1 that the trend of devel-
opment of standard databases and their ground truth
labeling has witnessed a notable growth in the last few
years. Attempts have been made to capture as much vari-
ation in writing as possible by considering a large number
of writers in the data collection process. In terms of num-
ber of writers, RIMES database [5, 63] seems to be the
most comprehensive with around 1300 individuals con-
tributing their writing samples. From the view point of
number of writing samples, RIMES comprises more than
12,000 pages of handwritten text, one of the largest collec-
tion of unconstrained handwritten images. This database,
however, is not publically available. In terms of usage, the
IAM handwriting database [2, 3] is one of the most widely
used databases for a number of recognition tasks. The
only major issue with IAM database is the non-uniform
distribution of samples per writer which varies frommore
than 50 for 1 writer to 1 for about 350 writers. This
complicates the evaluation protocols for writer identifi-
cation and verification systems where varied amount of
text per writer is available to train and test the systems.
Nevertheless, IAM databases remain one of the most pop-
ular databases employed by the handwriting recognition
community. Likewise, for research on Arabic handwrit-
ing, the IFN/ENIT database has been most extensively
employed for Arabic handwriting recognition and Arabic
writer identification.
Naturally, most of the databases discussed in our study
are based on English or Arabic writing samples. This
is due to the significant research attention these lan-
guages have received over the last three decades. During
the last few years, however, research on text in other
languages has also gained interest resulting in the devel-
opment of handwritten databases in many languages like
Farsi and Urdu. A trend of having multi-script databases
can also be witnessed in the recently developed databases.
Such collections provide an opportunity to study the
interesting scenarios of finding common writing patterns
of individuals across different scripts. QUWI database
[148] is an example of such a multi-script database com-
prising writing samples in Arabic and English. Another
interesting aspect in recent databases is that instead
of simply keeping the identity of the writer, additional
information including the age, gender and background
of the writer is also stored allowing development and
evaluation of automatic user demographics classification
systems, a relatively less explored area in handwriting
analysis.
From the view point of textual content, the prelim-
inary databases in all the scripts mostly comprised
isolated characters, digits or words. These databases
were mainly employed to evaluate the initial research
endeavors in recognition of characters, digits and
words. With the advancement in computerized
recognition of handwriting, databases comprising
unconstrained text (paragraphs) in natural writing
styles of contributors were developed. These databases
allowed evaluation of unconstrained handwriting
recognition rather than simply character or word
recognition.
An important parameter in the analysis of different
databases is how well they represent the real-world sce-
narios. Databases where the acquisition is unconstrained
and provides writers the flexibility to write in their natural
styles are more close to the writing samples encoun-
tered in the real-world problems. For applications like
handwriting recognition, significant training data is avail-
able, but for problems like forensic document analy-
sis (writer identification, writer verification, etc.), the
amount of text available to learn the characteristics of
an individual is, in general, limited. Same is the case
in the test phase where only limited text may be avail-
able to find the identity of an individual from a given
writing sample. Systems developed for such applications
should therefore be evaluated in experimental setups
which match the real-world constraints. There is also
a need to consolidate the large number of databases
at a common platform allowing researchers in docu-
ment analysis and recognition choose the most appropri-
ate database(s) for development and evaluation of their
systems.
As discussed earlier, the problems that could be evalu-
ated using a given database are a function of the ground
truth information provided with the database. For all
recognition tasks, the database must be accompanied
by the corresponding transcription (character, word or
paragraph level). Likewise, systems dealing with identi-
fication or verification of writers and prediction of user
demographics from handwriting require writer informa-
tion to be stored along with each writing sample. Table 2
groups the databases discussed in this paper as a func-
tion of tasks in which they can be employed. Expectedly,
most of the handwriting databases have been developed
for evaluation of offline handwriting recognition sys-
tems. Few recent databases support evaluation of online
recognition systems as well. The least explored area
seems to be user demographics classification from hand-
writing and only a few databases contain the required
ground truth (writer) information to evaluate such
systems.

4 Campaigns, projects, competitions and results
During the recent years, the development of standard-
ized datasets and their labeling has moved a step fur-
ther to the organization of different evaluation campaigns
and competitions. These competitions, related to differ-
ent classical tasks of document analysis and recognition,
not only allow a meaningful comparison of different algo-
rithms under the same experimental conditions but also
provide a platform for exchange of ideas and knowledge.
This section is dedicated to the discussion of these cam-
paigns and contests, but prior to that we present the
UNIPEN project, a major milestone in online handwriting
recognition.
4.1 UNIPEN project for online data exchange
The UNIPEN project [15] of data exchange was initiated
by International Association of pattern recognition (TC-
11) in 1992 with the objective of proposing a uniform
format for representation and exchange of online data.
The format was developed in collaboration with a group
of 14 experts in online handwriting recognition. The
participants of the project were asked to submit a mini-
mum of 12,000 characters in any form (sentences, words
or individual characters) and the approved data from
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
was made publically available. Presently, 11 datasets com-
prising characters, words and sentences have been com-
piled and software toolkits to manipulate the UNIPEN
files are also provided with the database.
4.2 RIMES evaluation campaign
The RIMES project [5] funded by French ministries of
defense and research was initiated to develop and eval-
uate automatic systems for indexing and recognition of
handwritten letters. The project aimed at not only creat-
ing a large annotated database but also to organize a set
of evaluation campaigns covering a variety of document
recognition tasks which could eventually fit in different
industrial applications. The first phase of the evalua-
tion campaign [63] comprised tasks including document
(letters and fax) layout analysis, handwriting recognition
(isolated characters, words and blocks of text), writer
identification (on words and paragraphs), writer verifica-
tion, logo recognition and identification of scenario from
letters. The second phase of the campaign [214] focused
on three themes, document layout analysis, handwriting
recognition and writer identification and a total of seven
tasks. Five French research labs participated in this sec-
ond phase of evaluations. After two successful phases of
evaluations, the database was employed in a number of
International competitions, discussed later in this paper.
4.3 Organization of competitions
The last few years have seen an increasing trend in the
organization of International competitions on different
tasks in document analysis and recognition. These con-
tests are mainly advertised and organized in conjunc-
tion with the reputed document recognition conferences,
International Conference on Document Analysis and
Recognition (ICDAR) and International Conference on
Frontiers in Handwriting Recognition (ICFHR) being the
twomost notable platforms. These contests provide train-
ing and validation datasets to the participants and require
them to submit either the executables of their developed
algorithms or the results on the unlabeled test datasets.
A major proportion of these competitions are based on
handwriting recognition and other related tasks. In most
cases, the evaluation is carried out on published and well-
known handwritten databases. In Table 3, we present a
summary of the competitions based on the databases dis-
cussed in Section 3. It can be seen that IFN/ENIT is easily
the most widely used database in the regularly organized
Arabic handwriting recognition competitions. Recogni-

received an increased research attention. Other than the
traditional recognition tasks, competitions on prediction
of gender from handwriting have recently gained signif-
icant interest. Although a very large number of groups
participated in these competitions, a relatively lesser num-
ber of groups actually revealed their identities and pro-
vided a description of their algorithms [149, 150]. In
addition to the contests mentioned in Table 3, a num-
ber of other competitions on handwritten databases have
also been organized but since they employ non-published
or private databases, they are beyond the scope of our
discussion.
4.4 Experimental protocols, evaluation metrics and
state-of-the-art results
In this section, we discuss the experimental settings and
evaluation metrics that are employed by researchers to
solve the problems based on analysis of handwriting. As
discussed earlier, the most important of these tasks is
handwriting recognition which is carried out at charac-
ter, word and line levels. Consequently, these systems
report results in terms of character and word recognition
rates. In some cases, the edit distance between the rec-
ognized text and ground truth text is used to quantify
the recognition performance. Likewise, the handwritten
keyword spotting systems are evaluated using the stan-
dard precision and recall measures. The two measures are
generally combined into a single f-measure to represent
the performance by a single number.
For writer identification systems, the performance is
evaluated either using a leave-one-out-approach or by
splitting the database into training and test sets, the later
being more commonly employed. In most cases, in addi-
tion to the identification rate, the Top-K identification
rates are also reported where for a given query document,
a list of most similarK writers is retrieved which increases
the chances of finding the true writer of the query doc-
ument. Similarly, the performance of writer verification
systems is represented through receiver operating charac-
teristic (ROC) curves and is quantified through area under
the curve (AUC) or equal error rates (EER). The closely
related task of gender (and user demographics) prediction
from handwriting is evaluated using the classification rate.
To provide an idea on the performance of state-of-the-
art systems on different handwriting recognition tasks, we
present a summary of some of the best results reported in
the literature on commonly used handwriting databases
in Table 4. Few of these results have been taken from the
findings of different International competitions while oth-
ers have been compiled from the literature as reported
by the respective researchers (to the best of the authors’
knowledge). For handwriting recognition, a high word
recognition rate of 94.85% [69] is reported on the RIMES
database. The recognition rates on the IAM database vary

IFN/ENIT Handwriting recognition Train: 32,492 words, Test: 8671 words Recognition rate 93.37% [217]

IAM Handwriting recognition Varied Recognition rate 80-90% [215, 216]
Writer identification 657 writers, one sample each in training

Top 1 Identification Rate 96.7% [218]
RIMES Word recognition Training: 50,000 words, validation: 7000,
test: 5740 words
Recognition rate 94.87% [69]
KHATT Writer identification 1000 writers with 4 samples/writers in
training, test: 1822 images
Top 1 Identification Rate 73.4% [231]
CVL Digit recognition Train: 7,000, validation: 7,000, test: 21,780 Precision 97.74% [115]
CASIA Character recognition 3755 character classes Recognition rate Offline:94.77%,
online: 97.39% [229]
as different studies employ different evaluation protocols
and an objective comparison is hard to make. The stan-
dard protocol for IAM lines comprises 6161 lines (45,000+
words) for training, 920 lines (7000+ words) for validation
and 2781 lines (around 20,000 words) for testing. Word
recognition rates in the range 80–90% are reported by
a number of studies [215, 216]. These recognition rates,
in general, are lower than those reported on the RIMES
database. It should however be noted that the RIMES
test set comprises 1600 unique words while the com-
plete IAM database comprises a vocabulary of more than
10,000 words, a major reason for relatively lower recog-
nition rates. Regarding Arabic handwriting recognition, a
high word recognition rate of 93.37% [217] is reported on
the IFN/ENIT database.
Writer identification systems have been most evalu-
ated and compared on the IAM database and a highest
identification rate of 96.7% is reported in [218] with one
sample of each of the 657 writers in training and one
in the test set. Like Arabic handwriting recognition, the
writer identification systems targeting Arabic handwrit-
ings mostly employ the IFN/ENIT database. The sys-
tem presented in [219] realizes the highest identification
rate of 90% on the 411 writers of this database. Writer
identification rates on the recently developed KHATT
database are relatively lower (73.4%) mainly due to a large
number of writers (1000) in the database. The QUWI
database which includes writer demographics information
has been employed for gender classification in a number
of recent studies and a highest classification rate of 69.25%
is realized [150]. Although a two-class problem, gender
prediction from handwriting is a challenging task as the
correlation between handwriting and gender is not known
to be very strong, a major reason for low classification
rates. A step further in evaluation of writer identifica-
tion and gender classification systems is the multi-script
experimental setup where training and test samples come
from different scripts. Naturally, the recognition rates
(55% on writer identification and 65% on gender classi-
fication [220]) on these challenging problems are not as
high as in case of a single script. Robust systems which
exploit the common features of writers across different
scripts need to be investigated to enhance the current
state-of-the-art on these tasks.
5 Conclusions
Research in handwriting recognition and related areas
is a challenging problem. The field has seen more
than 30 years of intensive research, and state-of-the-
art solutions have been developed for many problems.
A number of handwriting recognition problems still
remain inviting for the document recognition commu-
nity and significant research targeting different aspects
of handwriting recognition is being carried out presently.
During the recent years, there has been an increas-
ing trend of developing standard databases, compiling
the ground truth data to support different recogni-
tion tasks and exposing the databases to the research
community to explore and investigate their algorithms.
In general, the statistics and ground truth informa-
tion of each database is detailed in their respective
publications.

This paper is an endeavor to provide a comprehensive
survey of notable databases of handwritten text developed
over the last two decades. For each database, we provided
details on its structure, statistics, ground truth informa-
tion and the tasks supported. Typically, these databases
target one ormore of the preprocessing, segmentation and
recognition tasks. The type of task(s) that can be evaluated
with a given database is a function of the ground truth data
accompanying the database. In addition to the location
and transcription of text, information about contributors
is also stored in some cases allowing evaluation of writer
recognition and writer demographics classification tasks
as well.
We also discussed the evaluation campaigns and com-
petitions organized using these databases. Organization of
competitions in conjunction with reputed document and
handwriting recognition conferences has become a regu-
lar activity for the last few years. The increasing number
of participants in these competitions is a clear indication
of the kind of research attention different problems of
handwritten documents are attracting. In addition to the
description of databases, we also summarized the state-of-
the-art results on commonly used databases for a number
of recognition tasks.
This contribution is likely to provide a summarized
review of different databases allowing researchers choose
the most appropriate datasets for evaluation of their pro-
posed systems.
