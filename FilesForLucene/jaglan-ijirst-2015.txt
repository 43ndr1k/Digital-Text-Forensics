Abstract 
 
Web documents are often viewed as complicated objects which frequently contain multiple entities every of which may represent 
a separate unit. Though, most processing requests applications for the web and web content because of the smallest indivisible 
components and knowledge Extraction from Web Pages has continually trusted comprehensive human involvement within the 
sort of hand crafted extraction algorithms or scripts using usual expressions. Preceding works usually flout the underlying 
content segments that are composed of un-important knowledge like net ads and knowledge moot to the users. This paper resolve 
these subjects, we tend to endorsed n-gram established website segmentation algorithmic program that used the density for 
segmenting the webpage lacking hoping on the DOM tree for the segmentation method.

I. INTRODUCTION 
Web documents can be viewed as complex objects which often contain multiple entities each of which can represent a 
standalone unit. However, most information processing applications developed for the web, consider web pages as the smallest 
undividable units. This fact is best illustrated by web information retrieval engines whose results are presented in the form of 
links to web documents rather than to the exact regions within these documents that directly match a user's query [1]. Various 
approaches that have been adopted in carrying out the segmentation task have been identified and their advantages and 
disadvantages associated with each. We describe web page segmentation methods & compare them from theoretical point of 
view fixed-length technique is that no semantic info is taken into consideration within. DOM provides every online page with a 
fine-grained structure. VIPS discards content analysis and produce blocks based on the visual cues of web pages. In general, 
passages can be categorized into three classes: discourse, semantic, and window [2]. Discourse passages rely on the logical 
structure of the documents marked by punctuation, such as sentences, paragraphs and sections. Semantic passages are obtained 
by partitioning a document into topics or sub-topics according to its semantic structure. A third type of passages, fixed-length 
passages or windows, are defined to contain fixed number of words. While directly adopting these passage definitions for 
partitioning web pages is feasible, there exist some new characteristics in web pages which can be utilized. We describe each of 
them below: 
1) Two-Dimension Logical Structure  
Different from plain-text documents, web pages have a 2-D view and a more sophisticated internal content structure. Each region 
of a web page could have relationships with regions from up to four directions and contain or be contained in some other regions. 
A content structure in semantic level exists for most pages and can be used to enhance retrieval. 
2) Visual Layout Presentation  
To facilitate browsing and attract attention, web pages usually contain much visual information in the tags and properties in 
HTML. Typical visual hints include lines, blank areas, colors, pictures, fonts, etc. Visual cues are very helpful to detect the 
semantic regions in web pages. 
Web page segmentation has been done to address a problem in different fields including mobile web, web page phishing, 
duplicate detection, information retrieval, information classification, information extraction, evaluating visual quality 
(aesthetics), web page classification / clustering, caching, publishing dynamic content, semantic annotation, web accessibility 
etc. [3]. 
 Segmentation Methods A.
In this section, we describe web page segmentation methods & compare them from theoretical point of view. And also shows 
natural conformity between these segmentation methods and traditional passage retrieval methods.

 Fixed-length Page Segmentation (Fixed PS) 1)
In traditional text retrieval, fixed-length passages, or windows, are used to overcome the issue of length normalization. A fixed 
length passage contains fixed range of continuous words. An overlapped window approach during which the primary window in 
one document starts at the primary prevalence of a question term, and consequent windows half-overlap preceding ones [6]. 
For internet documents, fixed-length page segmentation is just like traditional window approach except that every HTML tags 
and attributes are removed. The length of window is that the solely parameter and is recommended to be two hundred or 250 
from past expertise.. 
 DOM-based Page Segmentation (Dom PS) 2)
DOM provides every online page with a fine-grained structure, that illustrates not solely the content however conjointly the 
presentation of the page. In general, similar to discourse passages, the blocks made by DOM-based strategies tend to partition 
pages supported their predefined syntactic structure, i.e., the hypertext markup language tags. 
There are some approaches that take into consideration the problem of page segmentation, however there's no consistent way 
to do it and, to the most effective of our knowledge, few works are done on applying DOM primarily based page segmentation 
strategies on internet info retrieval. Some straightforward experiments are performed where sub-trees labeled with<TITLE>, 
<P>, <H1>~<H3> and <META> are treated as blocks, but the results are not encouraging. The reasons may lie in the following 
three aspects.  
 Vision-based Page Segmentation (VIPS) 3)
People view a web page through a web browser and get a 2-D presentation which provides many visual cues to help distinguish 
different parts of the page, such as lines, blanks, images, colors, etc. For the sake of easy browsing and understanding, a closely 
packed block within the web page is much likely about a single semantic. 
We have previously proposed a vision-based page segmentation method called VIPS. Similar to semantic passages, the blocks 
obtained by VIPS are based on the semantic structure of web pages. Traditional semantic passages are obtained based on content 
analysis which is very slow, difficult and inaccurate [7]. VIPS discards content analysis and produce blocks based on the visual 
cues of web pages. This method simulates how a user understands web layout structure based on his or her visual perception. 
 Hybrid Approaches 4)
Although VIPS can distinguish multiple topics in web pages, it does not consider the document length normalization problem.  
As can be seen from this figure, the distribution of block length is very diverse. More than 40% of the blocks are only less than 
10 words, and 10% blocks are larger than 500 words. Thus the varying length problem still exists even if we perform retrieval on 
block level.  Since fixed-length windows show great consistence on dealing with the varying length problem, The Hybrid Page 
Segmentation which tries to take advantage of both visual information and fixed length. 
II. RELATED WORK 
Many web applications uses web page semantic structure and contents. Hattori et al. [1] provided a segmentation method by 
calculating the distance between content elements of HTML tags structure. Different web page segmentation methods were 
introduced based on visual and non-visual characteristics. In web information accessing, some researchers use database 
technique for building wrappers for the information extraction. For building wrappers, web documents are divided into parts. 
Diao et al. [2] provided segments of web page based on query processing using different HTML tags. Lin et al. [3] used only 
table tag for content blocks. Cai et al. [4] given an algorithm for extracting web based semantic structure. These semantic 
structures are in hierarchal nature which corresponds to a block. This algorithm made use of page layout feature. Alcic et al. [5] 
provided distance measures for content units on the basis of web page properties and DOM structure of web page. Nguyen et al. 
[6] proposed a method for segmenting a Web page into its semantic parts. There method segmented the page into blocks and then 
classifies the blocks. Bhardwaj, A. et al. [7], drafted that quick progress of the internet and web publishing methods craft 
countless data origins published as HTML pages on Web. Though, there was lot of redundant and irrelevant data additionally on 
web pages. Such data makes varied web excavating tasks such as web page scuttling, web page association, link established 
ranking, case distillation complex. This paper debated assorted ways for removing informative content from web pages and a 
new way for content extraction from web pages and density of links. Srivastava, S. et al.[8], presented that in the globe of data 
knowledge the adjustments happens rapidly. As the new technologies always adjusts the globe of data representation, the result 
was to find out relevant pieces of data cluttering alongside distracted features(like advertisements, links, scrollers etc.) in the 
finished web page. Data or functional content Kumud Jaglan1 IJECS Volume 4 Issue 6 June, 2015 Page No.12970-12973 Page 
12971 extraction from the web pages (structured or semi structured) becomes a critical subject for web users and web miners. So 
the data extraction from the web page carries a huge importance. A mystifying mystery for data extraction is to depict the noisy 
area and its removal. They examine the DOM tree segmentation alongside class attribute established approach. The class 
attribute can be utilized alongside all HTML agents inside the `BODY' serving of the document. It was utilized to craft disparate 
classes of an agent, whereas every single class can have its own properties. To assess the arrangement presentation countless 
examinations completed on disparate business, news, and entertainment websites. Chee Sheen Chan et al. [9], proposed an 
ontology based web page segmentation algorithm for extracting web images with its associated contextual information according 
to its semantic characteristics like picture annotation, clustering of pictures, inference of picture semantic content and picture 
indexing. Sanoja, A. et al. [10], depicted a web page segmentation framework. It wass a hybrid way inspired by automated

document processing methods and visual-based content segmentation techniques. A web page was associated alongside three 
structures: the DOM tree, the content construction and the logical structure. The DOM tree embodies the HTML agents of a 
page, the content construction organizes page objects according to content's groups and geometry and in the end the logical 
construction is the consequence of mapping content construction on the basis of the human-perceptible meaning that conforms 
the blocks.  
III.   PROPOSED WORK 
Web Information Extraction (WIE) has always depended on extensive human involvement in the form of hand crafted extraction 
algorithms or hand crafted training examples. Furthermore the experienced user is needed to explicitly specify each relation 
which he has interest for extraction. Although information extraction from web has become increasingly automated, finding all  
possible interests relations for the information extraction from any web retrieval system is extremely problematic for large and 
dynamic platforms as the web. To enable users to issue various queries on heterogeneous sources, Web information extraction 
systems must move away architectures that require relationships to be specified before questioning time for those to discover all 
the possible relationships text.  
Although WIE has received a lot of attention by researchers over the years however, most of the works are based on 
examining the HTML or the DOM tree of the Web pages. Web documents can be viewed as complex objects which often 
contain multiple entities each of which can represent a standalone unit. However, most information processing applications 
developed for the web, consider web pages as the smallest undividable units. Also the websites contain a mixture of objects with 
no unifying structure underneath, with differences in the authoring style and content much greater than in traditional collections 
of text documents the difficulty of information extraction task can be even more complex when multiple arrangements of 
attributes exist and typo-graphic errors occur in the input web documents.   
Previously Vision based segmentation algorithms such as VIPS (Vision-based Page Segmentation) algorithm exists to extract 
the semantic structure from web pages. These semantic structures are hierarchical structures, these hierarchical structures 
represent corresponds to a block in the web page. In VIPS each node is assigned a Degree to indicate visual perception of the 
block. The Vision-based Page Segmentation algorithm makes use of page layout feature however VIPS ignores the underlying 
content as segments can be composed of un-important information such as web ads, to solve these issues we proposed a n-gram 
based web page segmentation algorithm. That utilized the n-grams for segmenting the webpage without relying on the DOM tree 
for the segmentation process.

VI.  RESULTS AND ANALYSIS 
 HTML Source Size of Pages A.
Web search engines and some other sites use Web crawling or spidering software to update their web content or indexes of 
others sites' web content. Web crawlers can copy all the pages they visit for later processing by a search engine which indexes 
the downloaded pages so the users can search much more efficiently. All web crawlers allow users to view the HTML or other 
source code of any of the web pages they visit. For example, a user can view the code used to generate. The Search Engines use 
document indexing and Parsing to analyze the page content.

Web page parsing breaks apart the components (words) of a document or other form of media for insertion into the forward 
and inverted indices. The words found are called tokens, and so, in the context of search engine indexing and natural language 
processing, parsing is more commonly referred to as tokenization. It is also sometimes called word boundary disambiguation, 
tagging, text segmentation, content analysis, text analysis, text mining, concordance generation, speech segmentation, lexing, or 
lexical analysis.

 Conclusion A.
Web Information Extraction (WIE) has always depended on extensive human involvement in the form of hand crafted extraction

 Future Work B.
The web structure mining analyzes the structure of hyperlinks within the web.  The structure mining can be quite useful in 
determining the correlation between two or more Web pages. This understood connection conveys a useful tool for mapping 
completion and third party, such as resellers or consumers. This web information retrieval mechanism can help result links to the 
exact regions within these documents that directly match a user's query instead of to web documents. Yet another improved 
retrieval performance can be attained by considering the web pages having underlying structure with segments as fragments of 
the page. This can potentially result in a targeted model of query and search. For matter of fact, many applications can be 
assisted by the operation of semantically independent units or fragments. Such applications comprise web browsers for cell 
phones, Smart phones and non-PC terminals including as well as text summarization applications.   
Web pages are accessed by queries are submitted to the web databases and returned data is wrapped inside HTML Web pages. 
Extracting structured data from deep Web pages is a challenging problem due to the underlying structures of web pages. A large 
number of techniques have been proposed to solve this problem, but all of them have inherent limitations because they are 
language dependent. VisionIE provide the underlying content as segments can be composed of un-important information such as 
web ads. In future, a novel language-independent n-gram based approach can be Web-page implemented. An n-gram based web 
page segmentation algorithm can be implemented for extraction of web segments without relying on the DOM tree for the 
segmentation process. This approach will primarily utilize the word grams and their probability for web data extraction and 
segmentation, with data record extraction and data item extraction.
