ABSTRACT  
 Fraudulent emails can be detected by extraction of 
authorship information from the contents of emails. This 
paper presents information extraction based on unique 
words from the emails. These unique words will be used as 
representative features to train Radial Basis function (RBF). 
Final weights are obtained and subsequently used for 
testing. The percentage of identification of email authorship 
depends upon number of RBF centers and the type of 
functional words used for training RBF. One hundred and 
fifty authors with over one hundred files from the sent 
folder of Enron email dataset are considered. A total of 300 
unique words of number of characters in each word ranging 
from three to seven are considered. Training and testing of 
RBF are done by taking different lengths of words. Our 
simulation shows the effectiveness of the proposed RBF 
network for email authorship identification. The accuracy 
of authorship identification ranges from 95% to 97%. 
Keywords: email authorship identification, spam, word 
frequency, radial basis function 
1. INTRODUCTION 
As the volumes of emails on the net increases, spam and 
hoax mails have to be detected. The principal objective of 
author identification is to classify [Koppel et al, 2002] the 
emails belonging to an author. This approach is used in 
forensic for author identification in malicious emails. 
Certain commercial software such as AntConc, Copy Catch 
Gold, Lexico3, Signature Stylometric System, T-lab, 
Yoshikoder, and WordSmith 2Department of Information 
Technology 
Tools use statistical methods to identify an author. These 
systems use parameters such as the number of unique 
words,  number of content words used in the list, total 
number of words in the text or vocabulary items used, 
vocabulary richness, mean sentence length, mean paragraph 
length, mean of 2-3 letter words, mean of words starting 
with vowels, cumulative summation method, and bigrams. 
The users who intend to utilize the software for their email 
author identification need to choose the type of statistical 
analysis options that best identify author of an email and 
obtain the characteristics that remain constant for large 
number of emails written by the author. Each author 
follows a certain style, which is based on functional words. 
By using these functional words and their frequencies, 
identification of the author is possible [Madigan et al, 
2005].

2. RELATED WORK  
By and large, research has focused on different aspects 
of text. There are two different properties of the texts that 
are used in classification: the content of the text and the 
style of the author. Stylometry [Goodman 2007] is the 
statistical analysis of literary. Style complements traditional 
literary scholarship since it offers a means of capturing the 
often elusive character of an author’s style [Zheng 2006] by 
quantifying some of its features. Most stylometry [Pavelec 
et al. 2007] [Diederich and Chen 2008] studies employ 
items of language and most of these are lexically based. 
The usefulness of function words in Authorship 
attribution has been examined [Diederich et al. 2003]. 
Experiments were conducted with support vector machine 
classifiers in twenty novels and success rates above 90% 
were obtained. The use of functional words is a valid and 
good approach in attribution of authorship [Koppel 2006]. 
A success rate of 65% and 72% has been measured in the 
study for authorship recognition, which is an 
implementation of multiple regression and discriminant 
analysis [Stamatatos et al, 2000]. Concurrently experiments 
conducted with support vector classifiers [Diederich et al. 
2003] detected authors with 60-80% success rates using 
different parameters. 
The effect of word sequences in authorship [Abbasi 
2005] attribution has been studied. The researchers aimed 
to consider both stylistic and topic features of texts. In this 
work, the documents are identified by the set of word 
sequences that combine functional and content words. The 
experiments are conducted on a dataset consisting of poems 
using naïve Bayes classifier [Peng et al, 2004]. 
Later authorship studies (Farkhund Iqbal 2010) contain 
lexical, syntactic, structural and content-specific features. 
Lexical features are used to learn about the preferred use of 
isolated characters and words of an individual. Word-based 
features including word length distribution, words per 
sentence, and vocabulary richness were very effective. 
3. APPROACH OF INFORMATION 
EXTRACTION 
Different types of words are used for filtering and as 
templates. Words indicating work, action, different 
categories of prepositions, pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, 
conjunctions and interjections are listed in Table 1. While 
analyzing an email for uniqueness, the extracted features 
are categorized based on the list of words presented. Hence, 
unnecessary words are eliminated and the number of unique 
words that represent an email is minimal.

Words indicating work are used to analyze how an 
author writes an email. These avoid misinterpretation and 
elicit clarity in the email. The number of work-words will 
point out performance task requirements in a neat, 
unambiguous manner. These work-words decipher exactly 
what an author has in his mind. Action words indicate some 
actions being expressed in the email. Prepositions, 
adjectives, adverbs, conjunctions and interjections have 
their standard part-of-speech. 
The total number of words used as basic dictionary is 
1648 (work, action, prepositions, adjectives, adverbs, 
conjunctions and interjections). The numbers mentioned in 
the parenthesis are the total in each category whereas; only 
few words are shown in the tables for brevity.  
In the training phase, a variety of emails are input to the 
system. Tokenization is the process of extracting all the 
words in the email as tokens. These words are matched 
with the filter words given in Table 1. Subsequently, the 
word frequencies are calculated for each category. The 
author matrix is built with authors along the columns and 
their corresponding word frequencies. These entries are 
used as labeled training patterns. In the testing phase, new 
emails are input. Authors are identified based on the 
weights learnt. A schematic diagram for implementation of 
the proposed work is presented in Figure 1.

The concept of distance measure is used to associate the 
input and output pattern values. Radial Basis Function 
(RBF) is suitable for producing approximations to an 
unknown function f from a set of input data abscissa. The 
approximation is produced by passing an input point 
through a set of basis functions, each of which contains one 
of the RBF centers. 
An exponential function is used as an activation 
function for the input data. Distance between input data and 
set of centers chosen from the input data are found and 
passed through an exponential activation function. A bias 
value of f is used along with the data. These data are further 
processed to get a set of final weights between radial basis 
function and the target value. 
The topology of RBF network is twelve nodes in the 
input layer, four nodes in the hidden layer and one node in 
the output layer. The difference in input data and a center is 
passed through exp(-x) and is called the radial basis 
function. A rectangular matrix is further obtained for which 
inverse is found. The resultant value is processed with the 
entire inputs and target values to obtain final weights. 
The procedure is shown in the form of flowchart in 
Figure 2. The input pattern is read with the columns of the 
author matrix being used as training patterns. The number 
of patterns is equal to number of authors. Then, one 
hundred training patterns are created as centers. The 
distance between these centers and training patterns is

calculated to create RBF. The resultant values are passed 
through activation function, exp(-x) to produce outputs of 
RBF nodes in the hidden layer of the network. The number 
of training patterns and the number of centers will produce 
a rectangular matrix. This is converted into square matrix 
by singular value decomposition (SVD). Inverse of this 
matrix is found and processed with labeling to get final 
weights.

will produce a rectangular matrix. This is converted into 
square matrix and inverse of the same is found and 
processed with labeling to get final weights.

4. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE 
Enron email dataset has been used for evaluating the 
efficiency of RBF in email authorship identification. This 
email dataset was made public by the Federal Energy 
Regulatory Commission during its investigation [Klimt  
and Yang, 2004]. It contains all types of emails: personal 
and official. This contains around 5,17,431 emails from 151 
users. Each mail in the folders contains the senders and the 
receiver email addresses, date and time, subject, body, text 
and some other email specific technical details. It is 
available in the form of MySql database. The Enron 
database contains four tables. The first table contains 
information of each of the 151 employees. The second one 
contains the information of the email message, the sender, 
subject, text and other information. The third contains the 
recipient’s information. The fourth table contains 
information whether it was sent as a forward or reply. Table 
2 presents names of few folders under each author. We 
considered 146 authors for this study. 
There are fifteen unique words that are identified in all 
the emails under consideration by using the filtering words 
given in Table 1. The unique words are our, out, plan, 
please, that, to, we, what, when, which, with, you, your, 
yours, and zip.

5. CHARACTERIZATION MEASURES  
Based on certain grammatical rules followed and the 
words beginning with vowels in the emails by an author, 
characterization and feature extraction is done for training 
RBF. Figure 3 plots the authors’ id along x-axis and 
number of words with vowels at the beginning of words 
along the y-axis. Each stem is the average number of words 
beginning with vowels considering all the emails by an 
author. Figure 4 plots the number of “work” words used by 
each author. Figure 5 shows the number of “action” words. 
Figures 6 to 11 present the numbers of parts-of-speech – 
prepositions, pronouns, adjectives, adverbs, conjunctions 
and interjections – in the same order.

We use the following algorithm for email identification by 
neural network training and testing: 
For each author, find the number of words and their 
frequency of occurrences in every email by using the 
filtering words listed in Table 1. 
1. Construct a matrix with rows indicating total 
number of unique words considering all emails of the 
authors. Each column is for an author. 
2. Lexicon is built from the email corpus. 
3. A column of the zero matrix is filled based on the 
availability of the words in a document with their 
frequencies. Each column will be treated as a pattern for 
training. Labeling is done for each pattern.  
4. Train the RBF network with patterns considered 
for training. A final weight matrix is obtained which is 
further used to test the incoming mails that belong to 
existing authors else, the mail can belong to some other 
person other than these existing authors considered in 
this experiment. 
6. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS 
 
Figure 12 plots the performance of RBF in training the 
patterns. When the number of centers used is less than half 
of the total number of input patterns, the performance of 
author identification is minimal. As the number of centers 
increase, the author identification improves. The legend 
shows the number of centers varied. Figure 13 presents the 
performance of the RBF in terms of emails versus author 
identification. In this plot, output obtained from RBF 
overlaps target outputs. With 146 centers, the RBF 
identifies maximum number of authors.

We presented a novel method of identifying email 
authorship using RBF patterns of data. The training data 
has been collected by averaging the frequencies of words 
used by each person and fixing a target value for the 
person. Testing pattern has been created by modifying the 
existing contents of an email. A new word has been 
considered while testing. If the new word does not fit into 
the patterns used for training, that word is excluded in 
testing. As we are unaware to which author the email 
belongs, all the training patterns are treated as test patterns 
after adding the frequencies of the new mail. Since 146 
authors are considered, 146 outputs are obtained after 
testing 
Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) of the 
authorship identification reveals the following analysis: 
Has the author of a document been identified correctly? 
This is termed true positive. 
Has the author been wrongly classified, though the 
document does not belong to the same? This is termed false 
positive. 
Has a new document (not from the training corpus) 
been classified appropriately (not to the authors in this 
experiment). This is termed true negative

12 
Has a new document (not from the training corpus) 
been wrongly identified as belonging to one of the authors 
in the experiment? This is termed false negative. 
Sensitivity = Number of True Positives / (Number of 
True Positives + Number of False Negatives) 
Specificity = Number of True Negatives / (Number of 
True Negatives + Number of False Positives) 
False Positive Rate = 1 – Specificity 
Table 3 presents the confusion matrix values and the 
ROC values. The author emails have been considered that 
belong to the training corpus and that do not belong to 
training corpus. All the emails that belong to (sent / 
sent_mail) folders are used for training. The emails of the 
remaining folders of all authors have been considered for 
testing. The performance of RBF has been calculated using 
confusion matrix. The plot (Figure 14) indicates that the 
proposed RBF system suits the author identification from 
the given emails. This is inferred from the points obtained 
above the diagonal of the ROC curve.

7. CONCLUSION 
The RBF approach has been presented for detecting 
authors of emails, thereby reducing fraudulent emails. 
Different RBF centers and their effectiveness in author 
identification are presented. The receiver operating 
characteristics curve has shown that the proposed RBF 
network performance is acceptable. In future, the huge 
amount of words can be meaningfully filtered such that 
they are more specific to an author. This can further 
enhance the detection of unsolicited fraud emails. 
Therefore, the number of spam emails will decrease.
