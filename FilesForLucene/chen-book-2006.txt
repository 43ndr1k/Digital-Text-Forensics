DEDICATION 
I dedicate this book, with love, to the memory of my father, Kuang-Shen 
Chen (1 933- 1997) and my brother, I-Chun (Jingo) Chen (1 96 1-2000). This 
book also owes much to support from my family, in particular, my mom, Fu- 
Lien; my wife, Hsiao-Hui (Sherry); and my daughter and son, Hillary and 
Hugh. I would also like to thank the funding agencies, research partners, and 
all my mentors, colleagues, and students for their wisdom, encouragement, 
and inspiration over the years. Last but not least, I would like to thank Cathy 
Larson, Danitza Garcia, and Gary Folven for making the book production 
process professional and easy (for me). 
As a graduate student at New York University (NYU) from 1985 to 
1989, I spent many hours working on the NYU Wall Street and Washington 
Square campuses and taking the late-night subway trains from the World 
Trade Center to Queens and then to New Jersey. My heart ached on the day 
of September 11, 2001, and long after. May the heroes and citizens who 
perished in this tragic event rest in peace; and may the world never see 
another tragedy like this again.

PREFACE 
The commitment of the scientific, engineering, and health communities 
to helping the U.S. and the world respond to security challenges became 
evident after September 11, 2001. The U.S. National Research Council's 
report on "Making the Nation Safer: The Role of Science and Technology in 
Countering Terrorism" recommends that "a strategic long-term research and 
development agenda should be established to address three primary 
counterterrorism-related areas in IT: information and network security, the 
IT needs of emergency responders, and information fusion and 
management." 
In order to address these pressing and challenging national security 
research and development needs, many federal government and policy 
agencies, intelligence and public safety community, defense contractors, IT 
companies, national laboratories, and various academic research centers and 
institutions have begun to engage in significant Research & Development 
activities in national security. A new science of "Intelligence and Security 
Informatics" (ISI), akin to biomedical informatics, has begun to emerge and 
will continue to influence a new generation of policy makers, practitioners, 
researchers, and students. 
The R&D in information and network security should include approaches 
and architectures for prevention, identification, and containment of cyber- 
intrusions and recovery from them. The R&D to address IT needs of 
emergency responders should include ensuring interoperability, maintaining 
and expanding communications capability during an emergency, 
communicating with the public during an emergency, and providing support 
for decision makers. The R&D in information fusion and management for 
the intelligence, law enforcement, and emergency response communities 
should include data mining, data integration, language technologies, and 
processing of image and audio data. 
This monograph is based on nearly a decade of cutting-edge and hands- 
on law enforcement, intelligence, and security informatics research and 
community building experience of Dr. Hsinchun Chen and his lablcenter - 
the Artificial Intelligence Lab and the NSF COPLINK Center for 
Intelligence and Security Research. The monograph presents a national 
security research framework and discusses related IT technical components, 
directions, and past research, especially focusing on information sharing and 
data mining. Drawing from our own research experience, the book also 
includes many detailed case studies of how such technologies are developed 
and adopted in critical law enforcement, emergency response, intelligence 
analysis, and terrorism research contexts. This monograph expands 
significantly from an earlier review article in Annual Review of Information 
Science and Technology (ARIST), Volume 40,2005 (Chen and Xu, 2005). 
SCOPE AND ORGANIZATION 
The monograph aims to present its chapters in a manner understandable 
and useful to students, researchers, and security professionals. The first four 
chapters provide an overview of the field, including discussions of research 
challenges, an IS1 research framework, literature review of the field, and 
national security critical mission areas. Seventeen case studies based on our 
previous and ongoing research are then provided in six subsequent chapters 
(corresponding to six national security critical mission areas) to allow 
readers to get a closer look at the implementation challenges and 
opportunities. Chapter 1 1 presents important considerations for forming 
research partnerships in national security. The final chapter provides 
conclusions and future directions. In each chapter, we summarize future 
research opportunities and present questions for discussion in classes or 
seminars. The book also includes samples of a user data license and 
Memorandum of Understanding, and more than 150 references to research of 
relevance to homeland security research. The titles of the twelve chapters are 
listed below:

AUDIENCE 
The primary audience for the monograph includes the following: 
College professors, research scientists, graduate students, and select 
undergraduate juniors and seniors in computer science, information 
management, information science, and other related public safety, 
intelligence analysis, and terrorism research disciplines; 
Researchers, analysts, and policy makers in federal departments, national 
laboratories, intelligence community, public safety and law enforcement 
agencies, and the emergency response community; 
Consultants and practitioners in IT hardware, communication, and 
software companies, consulting firms, and defense contractors. 
We hope the readers will find the monograph of value to them. We also 
hope that future IS1 research will continue to help improve information 
sharing among national security agencies and increase collaboration among 
academics, local, state, and federal agencies, and industry, thereby bringing 
positive contributions to all aspects of our society.

INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY 
INFORMATICS (ISI): CHALLENGES AND 
OPPORTUNITIES 
Chapter Overview 
The tragic events of September 1 lth and the following anthrax contamination 
of letters caused drastic effects on many aspects of society. Academics in the 
fields of natural sciences, computational science, information science, social 
sciences, engineering, medicine, and many others have been called upon to 
help enhance the government's ability to fight terrorism and other crimes. 
Six critical mission areas have been identified where information technology 
can contribute, as suggested in the "National Strategy for Homeland 
Security" report, including: intelligence and warning, border and 
transportation security, domestic counter-terrorism, protecting critical 
infrastructure, defending against catastrophic terrorism, and emergency 
preparedness and responses. Facing the critical missions of national security 
and various data and technical challenges, we believe there is a pressing 
need to develop the science of "Intelligence and Security Informatics" (ISI). 
This chapter reviews IS1 research challenges, compares IS1 with the 
development of Biomedical Informatics, and suggests federal funding 
initiatives and research opportunities of relevance to ISI. 
Challenges and Opportunities 3 
1.1 Introduction 
The tragic events of September l l t h  and the following anthrax 
contamination of letters caused drastic effects on many aspects of society. 
Terrorism became the most significant threat to national security because of 
its potential to bring massive damage to our infrastructure, economy, and 
people. 
In response to this challenge, federal authorities are actively 
implementing comprehensive strategies and measures in order to achieve the 
three objectives identified in the "National Strategy for Homeland Security" 
report (Office of Homeland Security, 2002): (1) preventing future terrorist 
attacks, (2) reducing the nation's vulnerability, and (3) minimizing the 
damage and recovering from attacks that occur. State and local law 
enforcement agencies, likewise, are becoming more vigilant about the 
criminal activities that harm public safety and threaten national security. 
Academics in the fields of natural sciences, computational science, 
information science, social sciences, engineering, medicine, and many others 
have been called upon to help enhance the government's ability to fight 
terrorism and other crimes. Science and technology have been identified in 
the "National Strategy for Homeland Security" report as the keys to win the 
new counter-terrorism war (Office of Homeland Security, 2002). It is widely 
believed that information technology will play an indispensable role in 
making our nation safer (National Research Council, 2002) by supporting 
intelligence and knowledge discovery through collecting, processing, 
analyzing, and utilizing terrorism- and crime-related data (Chen et al., 
2003a; Chen et al., 2004b). Based on the crime and intelligence knowledge 
discovered, the federal, state, and local authorities can make timely decisions 
to select effective strategies and tactics as well as allocate the appropriate 
amount of resources to detect, prevent, and respond to future attacks. 
1.2 Information Technology and National Security 
Six critical mission areas have been identified where information 
technology can contribute to the accomplishment of the three strategic 
national security objectives identified in the "National Strategy for 
Homeland Security" report (Office of Homeland Security, 2002): 
Intelligence and Warning. Although terrorism depends on surprise to 
damage its targets (Office of Homeland Security, 2002), terrorist 
activities are not random and impossible to track. Terrorists must plan 
and prepare before the execution of an attack by selecting a target, 
recruiting and training executors, acquiring financial support, and 
4 INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY INFORMATICS 
traveling to the country where the target is located (Sageman, 2004). To 
avoid being preempted by authorities they may hide their true identities 
and disguise attack-related activities. Similarly, criminals may use 
falsified identities during police contacts (Wang et al., 2004a). Although 
it is difficult, detecting potential terrorist attacks or crimes is possible and 
feasible with the help of information technology. By analyzing the 
communication and activity patterns among terrorists and their contacts 
(i.e., terrorist networks), detecting deceptive identities, or employing 
other surveillance and monitoring techniques, intelligence and warning 
systems may issue timely, critical alerts and warnings to prevent attacks 
or crimes from occurring. 
Border and Transportation Security. Terrorists enter a targeted country 
through an air, land, or sea port of entry. Criminals in narcotics rings 
travel across borders to purchase, carry, distribute, and sell drugs. 
Information, such as travelers' identities, images, fingerprints, vehicles 
used, and other characteristics, is collected from customs, borders, and 
immigration authorities on a daily basis. Counter-terrorism and crime- 
fighting capabilities can be greatly improved by the creation of a "smart 
border," where information from multiple sources is shared and analyzed 
to help locate wanted terrorists or criminals. Technologies such as 
information sharing and integration, collaboration and communication, 
biometrics, and image and speech recognition will be greatly needed in 
such smart borders. 
Domestic Counter-terrorism. As terrorists, both international and 
domestic, may be involved in local crimes, state and local law 
enforcement agencies are also contributing to the missions by 
investigating and prosecuting crimes. Terrorism, like gangs and narcotics 
trafficking, is regarded as a type of organized crime in which multiple 
offenders cooperate to carry out offenses. Information technologies that 
help find cooperative relationships between criminals and their 
interactive patterns would also be helpful for analyzing terrorism. 
Monitoring activities of domestic terrorist and extremist groups using 
advanced information technologies will also be helpful to public safety 
personnel and policy makers. 
Protecting Critical Infrastructure and Key Assets. Roads, bridges, water 
supplies, and many other physical service systems are critical 
infrastructure and key assets of a nation. They may become the target of 
terrorist attacks because of their vulnerabilities (Office of Homeland 
Security, 2002). Moreover, virtual (cyber) infrastructure such as the 
Internet may also be vulnerable to intrusions and inside threats (Lee and 
Challenges and Opportunities 5 
Stolfo, 1998). Criminals and terrorists are increasingly using cyberspace 
to conduct illegal activities, share ideology, solicit funding, and recruit. 
In addition to physical devices such as sensors and detectors, advanced 
information technologies are needed to model the normal behaviors of 
the usage of these systems and then use the models to distinguish 
abnormal behaviors from normal behaviors. Protective or reactive 
measures can be selected based on the results to secure these assets from 
attacks. 
Defending Against Catastrophic Terrorism. Terrorist attacks can cause 
devastating damage to a society through the use of chemical, biological, 
or radiological weapons. Biological attacks, for example, may cause 
contamination, infectious disease outbreaks, and significant loss of life. 
Information systems that can efficiently and effectively collect, access, 
analyze, and report data about catastrophe-leading events can help 
prevent, detect, respond to, and manage these attacks (Damianos et al., 
2002). 
Emergency Preparedness and Responses. In case of a national 
emergency, prompt and effective responses are critical to reduce the 
damage resulting from an attack. In addition to the systems that are 
prepared to defend against catastrophes, information technologies that 
help design and experiment with optimized response plans (Lu et al., 
2003), identify experts, train response professionals, and manage 
consequences are beneficial in the long run. Moreover, information 
systems that facilitate social and psychological support to the victims of 
terrorist attacks can also help society recover from disasters. 
Although it is important for the critical missions of national security, the 
developmeit of information technology for counter-terrorism and crime- 
fighting applications faces many problems and challenges. 
1.3 Problems and Challenges 
Currently, intelligence and security agencies are gathering large amounts 
of data from various sources. Processing and analyzing such data, however, 
has become increasingly difficult. By treating terrorism as a form of 
organized crime, these challenges can be categorized into three types: 
Characteristics of criminals and crimes. Some crimes may be 
geographically diffused and temporally dispersed. In organized crimes 
such as transnational narcotics trafficking, criminals often live in 
different countries, states, and cities. Drug distribution and sales occur in 
different places at different times. Similar situations exist in other 
INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY INFORMA TICS 
organized crimes (e.g., terrorism, armed robbery, and gang-related 
crime). As a result, an investigation must cover multiple offenders who 
commit criminal activities in different places at different times. This can 
be fairly difficult given the limited resources that intelligence and 
security agencies have. Moreover, as computer and Internet technologies 
advance, criminals are utilizing cyberspace to commit various types of 
cybercrimes under the disguise of ordinary online transactions and 
communications. 
Characteristics of crime and intelligence related data. A significant 
source of challenge is information stovepipe and overload resulting from 
diverse data sources, multiple data formats, and large data volumes. 
Unlike other domains such as marketing, finance, and medicine in which 
data can be collected from particular sources (e.g., sales records from 
companies, patient medical history from hospitals), the intelligence and 
security domain does not have a well-defined data source. Both 
authoritative information (e.g., crime incident reports, telephone records, 
financial statements, immigration and customs records) and open source 
information (e.g., news stories, journal articles, books, web pages) need 
to be gathered for investigative purposes. Data collected from these 
different sources often are in different formats ranging from structured 
database records to unstructured text, image, audio, and video files. 
Important information such as criminal associations may be available but 
contained in unstructured, multilingual texts and remains difficult to 
access and retrieve. Moreover, as data volumes continue to grow, 
extracting valuable and credible intelligence and knowledge becomes a 
difficult problem. 
Characteristics of crime and intelligence analysis techniques. Current 
research on the technologies for counter-terrorism and crime-fighting 
applications lacks a consistent framework addressing the major 
challenges. Some information technologies including data integration, 
data analysis, text mining, image and video processing, and evidence 
combination have been identified as being particularly helpful (National 
Research Council, 2002). However, the question of how to employ them 
in the intelligence and security domain and use them to effectively 
address the critical mission areas of national security remains 
unanswered. 
Facing the critical missions of national security and various data and 
technical challenges, we believe there is a pressing need to develop the 
science of "Intelligence and Security Informatics" (ISI) (Chen et al., 2003a; 
Chen et al., 2004b), with its main objective being the "development of 
Challenges and Opportunities 7 
advanced information technologies, systems, algorithms, and databases for 
national security-related applications, through an integrated technological, 
organizational, and policy-based approach" (Chen et al., 2003a). 
1.4 Intelligence and Security Informatics vs. Biomedical 
Informatics: Emergence of a Discipline 
Comparing IS1 with Biomedical Informatics, an established academic 
discipline addressing information management issues in biological and 
medical applications (Shortliffe and Blois, 2000; Chen et al., 2005), we 
found tremendous analogies between these two disciplines. Table 1-1 
summarizes the similarities and differences between IS1 and Biomedical 
Informatics.

8 INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY INFORMATICS 
In terms of data characteristics, they both face the information stovepipe 
and information overload problem. In terms of technology development, 
they both are searching for new approaches, methods, and innovative use of 
existing techniques. In terms of scientific contributions, they both may add 
new insights and knowledge to various academic disciplines. 
Most importantly, as a consistent research framework based on 
knowledge management and data mining has begun to emerge in biomedical 
informatics (Chen et al., 2005), IS1 also needs a framework to guide its 
research. Facing the unique challenges (and associated opportunities) of 
information overload and the pressing need for advanced criminal and 
intelligence analyses and investigations, we believe that the Knowledge 
Discovery from Databases (KDD) methodology (Fayyad and Uthurusamy, 
2002), which has achieved significant success in other information-intensive, 
knowledge-critical domains including business, engineering, biology, and 
medicine, could be critical in addressing the challenges and problems facing 
ISI. More details about such a research framework will be discussed in the 
following chapter. 
1.5 Federal Initiatives and Funding Opportunities in IS1 
Similar to biocomputing and biomedical informatics, a new, emerging, 
and critical discipline such as IS1 not only can spark the imagination and 
excitement of society, but it also draws the attention of federal funding 
agencies. As a testament to the importance of ISI-related research, the 
United States National Science Foundation (NSF) publicly stated its strong 
commitment to national security research (as stipulated in its founding 
mandate), in addition to its traditional leadership role in basic science and 
engineering research and education. Many federal research and funding 
agencies in the United States have established new research programs that 
aim to address different facets of national security research.Without 
intending to be comprehensive, we summarize some significant past and 
ongoing federal funding programs of relevance to ISI, especially for 
academic researchers in universities and research institutes. There is much 
information about national security-related funding opportunities for 
commercial companies and vendors which will not be covered in this 
chapter. 
National Science Foundation (NSF): The NSF has issued several 
Information Technology Research (ITR) program announcements with a 
national security focus. The computing (CISE) and behavioral (SBE) 
divisions of NSF are encouraging multi-disciplinary research projects of 
relevance to ISI. The NSFICIA KDD (Knowledge Discovery and 
Challenges and Opportunities 9 
Dissemination) program is a good example of joint NSF and intelligence 
community funding initiatives. Most of the NSF-funded projects stress 
scientific innovation. 
Department of Homeland Security (DHS): DHS probably has the largest 
number of research initiatives of relevance to IS1 due to its agency 
mission. Four university-based homeland security research centers have 
been established. Many new ad hoc initiatives such as terrorism 
informatics research, bioagent surveillance, smart border, biometrics, 
deception detection, and critical infrastructure protection are also under 
active development. DHS-funded projects tend to be more problem- 
specific. Due to a lack of staff support, personnel turnover, and 
inexperience in funded research, the DHS proposal review process is 
significantly less structured than that of NSF. 
Department of Defense (DOD) and Intelligence Community: After the 
disastrous ending of the TIA (Total Information Awareness) program 
spearheaded by former Admiral Poindexter, the DOD and the 
intelligence community have not publicized many new research activities 
of relevance to ISI. One exception may be the ARDA (Advanced 
Research & Development Activity) program that aims to develop 
advanced information technologies for the intelligence community. The 
abovementioned joint NSFJCIA KDD program that draws top-notch 
researchers to perform unclassified national security and intelligence 
research is an excellent model for advanced and potentially high-impact 
IS1 research. 
Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and National Institutes 
of Health (NIH): Not surprisingly, CDC and NIH are supporting national 
security research of relevance to infectious diseases and bioagent 
surveillance. The National Library of Medicine has issued solicitations in 
crisis management of relevance to public health. Similar to DHS, CDC 
appropriates significant funding to state and local jurisdictions for their 
public health, disease surveillance, and emergency response needs. 
Although such projects are often short-term and implementation-oriented 
in nature, university researchers can benefit from collaborating with state 
and local public health agencies, and vice versa. 
Department of Justice (DOJ): DOJ and its research arm, National 
Institute of Justice (NIJ), traditionally fund research and development 
projects of relevance to local and state public safety and law enforcement 
agencies. Due to the importance of domestic counter-terrorism, focused 
counter-terrorism research programs have been developed at NIJ. Most 
of the NIJ projects are of smaller scale and single-PI in nature due to the 
10 INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY INFORMATICS 
agency's limited funding ability. Most projects need to demonstrate 
significant public-safety relevance and value. 
Office of Naval Research (ONR), Air Force Research Labs, private 
foundations, and others: There are many other funding opportunities with 
other traditional armed forces-specific federal funding agencies. Most of 
them have either adjusted or are adjusting their existing research 
programs to be of relevance to the new homeland security mission. 
Several private foundations have also begun to support selected 
homeland security-related research, in particular, in citizen responses, 
disaster relief, and education. 
For our readers we include a listing of sample federal program 
announcements of relevance to IS1 in the section below. The list is not 
intended to be comprehensive, but to illustrate the abundant research and 
funding opportunities in ISI. Readers are advised to perform periodic 
searches on the web for ongoing program announcements. 
National Science Foundation (NSF), Information Technology Research 
(ITR) Program: The NSF ITR Program has been successful in opening 
up opportunities at the frontiers of IT research and education. In its 
fourth year, FY 2003, the program stimulated research on the 
fundamental challenges facing the continued expansion and utilization of 
IT across the sciences and engineering, the creation of novel uses of IT, 
the interaction of IT with society at large, and the use of IT to enhance 
security and reduce society's vulnerabilities to catastrophic events, 
whether natural or man-made. In FY 2004, the focus is "ITR for National 
Priorities." Particular emphasis is placed on the distributed systems, grids 
and infrastructures that support the attainment of these national priorities. 
Department of Homeland Security (DHS): Through the Homeland 
Security Centers of Excellence Program, DHS is investing in university- 
based partnerships to develop centers of multi-disciplinary research 
where important fields of inquiry can be analyzed and best practices 
developed, debated, and shared. DHS selected the University of 
Southern California to house the first HS-Center, known as the 
Homeland Security Center for Risk and Economic Analysis of Terrorism 
Events (CREATE). Texas A&M University and its partners were 
selected as the HS-Center for Foreign Animal and Zoonotic Disease 
Defense. The University of Minnesota and its partners were selected as 
the HS-Center for Food Protection and Defense, which will address agro- 
security issues related to post-harvest food protection. The University of 
Maryland's team and its partners were selected recently as the fourth HS- 
Challenges and Opportunities I 1  
center to study the social, economic, and psychological dimensions of 
terrorism research. 
The DHS Innovative Architectures for Unified Incident Command and 
Decision Support Program seeks proposals for an innovative information 
management and sharing architecture that answers the growing needs of 
the emergency responder community. This solicitation seeks to confront 
the technical challenges associated with the development of such 
innovative, modular, scaleable, and secure information management 
architecture. 
The DHS Security Research and Development Program seeks the 
development and deployment of technologies to protect the nation's 
cyber infrastructure, including the Internet and other critical 
infrastructures that depend on computer systems for their mission. 
National Institutes of Health (NIH), National Library of Medicine 
(NLM), Informatics for Disaster Management Program: The National 
Library of Medicine, the National Institute of Mental Health, and the 
National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering support 
informatics research that addresses biomedical information management 
problems relevant to management of disasters. Disasters can be caused 
by nature or by man, through accident or by malice. Terrorism, 
particularly bioterrorism, is now an important focus of federal activity, 
but terrorism is only one of a number of threats to public safety classified 
as disasters. Disaster management is heavily dependent on efficient flow 
of information. How best to utilize information technology in a disaster 
situation poses a number of problems for which relevant informatics 
research is necessary. 
Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), National Center for 
Infectious Diseases (NCID), Bioterrorism Extramural Research Grant 
Program: The main functions of the CDC NCID Office include: program 
coordination, surveillance integration and informatics activities, and 
analytical activities of relevance to infectious diseases. The NCID Office 
of Extramural Research funded $8.4 million dollars for nine biodefense 
research grants in FY03. The NCID areas of interest for bioterrorism and 
infectious disease research include: surveillance and epidemiology, 
interruption of transmission, and environmental detection. 
Department of Defense (DOD), Advanced Research and Development 
Activity (ARDA) Program: The Advanced Research and Development 
Activity (ARDA) program is an Intelligence Community (IC) center for 
conducting advanced research and development related to information 
technology (IT) (information stored, transmitted, or manipulated by 
12 INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY INFOMA TICS 
electronic means). ARDA sponsors high risk, high payoff research 
designed to produce new technology to address some of the most 
important and challenging IT problems faced by the intelligence 
community. The research is currently organized into five technology 
thrusts: Information Exploitation, Quantum Information Science, Global 
Infosystems Access, Novel Intelligence from Massive Data, and 
Advanced Information Assurance. Recent solicitations include: 
Advanced Question and Answering for Intelligence; Video Analysis and 
Content Extraction (VACE) Phase 11; Proactive and Predictive 
Information Assurance for Next Geneva Systems; Advanced 
Countermeasures for Insider Threat; Information Assurance for the U.S. 
Intelligence Community; and Advanced Question and Answering 
Phase I. 
Department of Justice (DOJ), National Institute of Justice (NIJ): The 
National Institute of Justice (NIJ) is the research, development, and 
evaluation agency of the U.S. Department of Justice and a component of 
the Office of Justice Programs. NIJ provides objective, independent, 
evidence-based knowledge and tools to enhance the administration of 
justice and public safety. 
The NIJ's Situational Aspects of Crime Program seeks research that 
examines situational characteristics and the events that lead up to 
criminal acts in order to identify target points for prevention and 
intervention. Research under this solicitation should focus on the 
characteristics of criminal events or the interactions between the 
characteristics of situations and individuals. 
Their Terrorism and Transnational Crime Program seeks research and 
evaluation that will inform national policy and practice related to 
terrorism, transnational criminal behavior, and any connections between 
them. Proposed research should aim to improve criminal justice and first 
responder strategies for prevention of, preparation for, response to, and 
mitigation of terrorist incidents at the federal, state, and local levels. 
1.6 Future Directions 
The emergence of a new discipline such as IS1 would require careful 
cultivation and development by many top-notch researchers and practitioners 
from many different disciplines, including (but not limited to): computer 
science, information science, information systems, electrical engineering, 
social science, law, public policy, criminal justice, terrorism research, 
psychology, behavioral and economic sciences, management science, 
Challenges and Opportunities 13 
bioinformatics, public health, etc. There is an abundance of opportunities for 
developing new and innovative funded ISI-related projects. 
Regardless of which funding programs you may be considering for your 
research, there are some common characteristics among successfully funded 
and (eventually, after execution) high-impact projects: 
Unique and critical scientific or engineering innovations: You need to 
clearly distinguish your research from others. 
Important problems and significant partners: You need to address 
important national security problems and demonstrate your commitment 
to address these problems with the help and support of your local, state, 
and federal agency partners. 
From small to large: Most funded projects began humbly with proof-of- 
concept level funding. 
A multi-disciplinary team: After initial success, a multi-disciplinary team 
of computer scientists, system developers, social scientists, policy and 
legal experts, domain (intelligence and security) experts, and such will be 
needed to implement a full-scale, multi-phased, complex national 
security-related project. 
Aim high: The following tangible (but somewhat lofty) project goals are 
always good for your project team to aim at: (1) publishing your project 
findings in Science, Nature, or Proceedings of the Academy of Science 
(for its scientific contributions); and (2) being featured in a New York 
Times or USA Today front page article (for its societal impact). 
1.7 Questions for Discussion 
1. What are some ways to identify potentially relevant federal funding 
programs? How can the topics to focus on be determined? How do you 
interact with relevant program managers and directors for feedback? 
How do you get invited to a PI-only meeting when you are not a PI yet 
(but would like to become a PI)? How frequently do you need to travel to 
DC for project meetings? 
2. What are some ways to identify critical local, state, and federal partners 
for your research project? How do you convince them of your value? 
How do you get their letters of support, data, and commitment of time 
and personnel? How can you make the system work for all involved?

3. What are some ways to publish your work in this area? Which 
conferences and journals would be best? How can you publicize your 
work with the media and the press?

AN IS1 RESEARCH FRAMEWORK: 
INFORMATION SHARING AND DATA 
MINING 
Chapter Overview 
To address the data and technical challenges facing ISI, we present a 
research framework with a primary focus on KDD (Knowledge Discovery 
from Databases) technologies. The framework is discussed in the context of 
crime types and security implications. Selected data mining techniques, 
including information sharing and collaboration, association mining, 
classification and clustering, text mining, spatial and temporal mining, and 
criminal network analysis, are believed to be critical to criminal and 
intelligence analyses and investigations. In addition to the technical 
discussions, the chapter also discusses caveats for data mining and important 
civil liberties considerations. 
An ISI Research Framework 17 
2.1 Introduction 
Crime is an act or the commission of an act that is forbidden, or the 
omission of a duty that is commanded by a public law and that makes the 
offender liable to punishment by that law. The more threat a crime type 
poses on public safety, the more likely it is to be of national security 
concern. Some crimes such as traffic violations, theft, and homicide are 
mainly in the jurisdiction of local law enforcement agencies. Some other 
crimes need to be dealt with by both local law enforcement and national 
security authorities. Identity theft and fraud, for instance, are relevant at both 
the local and national level -- criminals may escape arrest by using false 
identities; drug smugglers may enter the United States by holding 
counterfeited passports or visas. Organized crimes, such as terrorism and 
narcotics trafficking, are often diffuse geographically, resulting in common 
security concerns across cities, states, and countries. Cybercrimes can pose 
threats to public safety across multiple jurisdictional areas due to the 
widespread nature of computer networks. 
Table 2-1 summarizes the different types of crimes sorted by the degree 
of their respective public influence (Chen et al., 2004a). International and 
domestic terrorism, in particular, often involves multiple crime types (e.g., 
identity theft, money laundering, arson and bombing, organized and violent 
activities, and cyber-terrorism) and causes great damage. 
2.2 An IS1 Research Framework 
We believe that KDD techniques can play a central role in improving 
counter-terrorism and crime-fighting capabilities of intelligence, security, 
and law enforcement agencies by reducing the cognitive and information 
overload. Knowledge discovery refers to non-trivial extraction of implicit, 
previously unknown, and potentially useful knowledge from data. 
Knowledge discovery techniques promise easy, convenient, and practical 
exploration of very large collections of data for organizations and users, and 
have been applied in marketing, finance, manufacturing, biology, and many 
other domains (e.g., predicting consumer behaviors, detecting credit card 
frauds, or clustering genes that have similar biological functions) (Fayyad 
and Uthurusamy, 2002). Traditional knowledge discovery techniques 
include association rules mining, classification and prediction, cluster 
analysis, and outlier analysis (Han and Kamber, 2001). As natural language 
processing (NLP) research advances, text mining approaches that 
automatically extract, summarize, categorize, and translate text documents 
have also been widely used (Chen, 200 1 ; Trybula, 1999). 
18 INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY INFORMATICS 
Many of these KDD technologies could be applied in IS1 studies (Chen et 
al., 2003a; Chen et al., 2004b). Keeping in mind the special characteristics of 
crimes, criminals, and crime-related data, we categorize existing IS1 
technologies into six classes: information sharing and collaboration, crime 
association mining, crime classij?cation and clustering, intelligence text 
mining, spatial and temporal crime mining, and criminal network mining. 
zble 2-1. Crime types and security concerns. 
These six classes are grounded on traditional knowledge discovery 
technologies with a few new approaches added, including spatial and 
temporal crime pattern mining and criminal network analysis, which are 
more relevant to counter-terrorism and crime investigation. Although 
information sharing and collaboration are not data mining per se, they help 
prepare, normalize, warehouse, and integrate data for knowledge discovery 
and thus are included in the framework. 
In Figure 2-1 we present our proposed research framework, with the 
horizontal axis being the crimes types and the vertical axis being the six 
classes of techniques (Chen et al., 2004a). The shaded regions on the chart 
show promising research areas, i.e., that a certain class of techniques is 
relevant to solving a certain type of crime. Note that more serious crimes

An ISI Research Framework 19 
may require a more complete set of knowledge discovery techniques. For 
example, the investigation of organized crimes such as terrorism may 
depend on criminal network analysis technology, which requires the use of 
other knowledge discovery techniques such as association mining and 
clustering. An important observation about this framework is that the high- 
frequency occurrences and strong association patterns of severe and 
organized crimes such as terrorism and narcotics present a unique 
opportunity and potentially high rewards for adopting such a knowledge 
discovery framework. 
Several unique classes of data mining techniques are of great relevance to 
IS1 research. Text mining is critical for extracting key entities (people, 
places, narcotics, weapons, time, etc.) and their relationships presented in 
voluminous police incident reports, intelligence reports, open source news 
clips, etc. Some of these techniques need to be multilingual in nature, 
including the abilities for machine translation and cross-lingual information 
retrieval (CLIR). Spatial and temporal mining and visualization are 
often needed for geographic information systems (GIs) and temporal 
analysis of criminal and terrorist events. Most crime analysts are well trained 
in GIS-based crime mapping tools; however, automated spatial and temporal 
pattern mining techniques (e.g., hotspot analysis) have not been adopted 
widely in intelligence and security applications.

Figure 2-1. A knowledge discovery research framework for ISI. 
Organized criminals (e.g., gangs and narcotics) and terrorists often form 
inter-connected covert networks for their illegal activities. Often referred to 
20 INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY INFORMATICS 
as "dark networks," these organizations exhibit unique structures, 
communication channels, and resilience to attack and disruption. New 
computational techniques, including social network analysis, network 
learning, and network topological analysis (e.g., random network, small- 
world network, and scale-free network), are needed for the systematic study 
of those complex and covert networks. We broadly consider these 
techniques under criminal network analysis in Figure 2-1. 
2.3 Caveats for Data Mining 
Before we review in detail relevant ISI-related data mining techniques, 
applications, and literature in the next chapter, we wish to briefly discuss the 
legal and ethical caveats regarding crime and intelligence research. 
The potential negative effects of intelligence gathering and analysis on 
the privacy and civil liberties of the public have been well publicized (Cook 
and Cook, 2003). There exist many laws, regulations, and agreements 
governing data collection, confidentiality, and reporting, which could 
directly impact the development and application of IS1 technologies. We 
strongly recommend that intelligence and security agencies and IS1 
researchers be aware of these laws and regulations in research. Moreover, 
we also suggest that a hypothesis-guided, evidence-based approach be used 
in crime and intelligence analysis research. That is, there should be probable 
and reasonable causes and evidence for targeting particular individuals or 
datasets for analysis. Proper investigative and legal procedures need to be 
strictly followed. It is neither ethical nor legal to "fish" for potential 
criminals from diverse and mixed crime-, intelligence-, and citizen-related 
data sources. The well-publicized Defense Advanced Research Program 
Agency (DARPA) Total Information Awareness (TIA) program and the 
Multi-State Anti-Terrorism Information Exchange (MATRIX) system, for 
example, have recently been shut down due to their potential misuse of 
citizen data and impairment of civil liberties (American Civil Liberties 
Union, 2004; O'Harrow, 2005). 
2.4 Domestic Security, Civil Liberties, and Knowledge 
Discovery 
In an important recent review article by Strickland, Baldwin, and Justsen 
(Strickland et al., 2005), the authors provide an excellent historical account 
of government surveillance in the United States. The article presents new 
surveillance initiatives in the age of terrorism (including the passage of the 
USA PATRIOT Act), discusses in great depth the impact of technology on 
An ISI Research Framework 21 
surveillance and citizen's rights, and proposes balancing between needed 
secrecy and oversight. We believe this is one of the most comprehensive 
articles addressing civil liberties issues in the context of national security 
research. We summarize some of the key points made in the article in the 
context of our proposed IS1 research. Readers are strongly encouraged to 
refer to (Strickland et al., 2005) for more details. 
Framed in the context of domestic security surveillance, the paper 
considers surveillance as an important intelligence tool that has the potential 
to contribute significantly to national security but also to infringe civil 
liberties. As faculty of the University of Maryland Information Science 
department, the authors believe that information science and technology has 
drastically expanded the mechanisms by which data can be collected, and 
knowledge extracted and disseminated through some automated means. 
An immediate result of the tragic events of September 1 1, 2001, was the 
extraordinarily rapid passage of the USA PATRIOT Act in late 2001. The 
legislation was passed by the Senate on October 11, 2001, by the House on 
October 24, 2001, and signed by the President on October 26, 2001. The 
continuing legacy of the then-existing consensus and the lack of detailed 
debate and considerations created a bitter ongoing national argument as to 
the proper balance between national security and civil liberties. The 
PATRIOT Act contains ten titles in 131 pages. It amends numerous laws, 
including, for example, expansion of electronic surveillance of 
communications in law enforcement cases; authorizing sharing of law 
enforcement data with intelligence; expansion of the acquisition of 
electronic communications as well as commercial records for intelligence 
use; and creation of new terrorism-related crimes. 
However, as new data mining and/or knowledge discovery techniques 
become mature and potentially useful for national security applications, 
there are great concerns of violating civil liberties. Both the DARPA's TIA 
Program and the Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) Computer 
Assisted Passenger Prescreening Systems (CAPPS 11) were cited as failed 
systems that faced significant media scrutiny and public opposition. Both 
systems were based on extensive data mining of commercial and 
government databases collected for one purpose and to be shared and used 
for another purpose; and both systems were sidetracked by a widely 
perceived threat to personal privacy. Based on much of the debate generated 
by these programs, the authors suggest that data mining using public or 
private sector databases for national security purposes must proceed in two 
stages - first, the search for general information must ensure anonymity; 
second, the acquisition of specific identity, if required, must be by court 
order under appropriate standards (e.g., in terms of "special needs" or 
"probable causes"). 
22 INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY INFORMATICS 
In their concluding remarks, the authors cautioned that secrecy in any 
organization could pose a real risk of abuse and must be constrained through 
effective checks and balances. Moreover, information science and 
technology professionals are ideally situated to provide the tools and 
techniques by which the necessary intelligence is collected, analyzed, and 
disseminated; while civil liberties are protected through established laws and 
policies. 
In addition to the review article by Strickland et al., readers are also 
referred to an excellent book entitled: No Place to Hide, written by 
Washington Post reporter Robert O'Harrow (O'Harrow, 2005). He reveals 
how the government is creating a national intelligence infrastructure with the 
help of private information, security, and technology companies. The book 
examines in detail the potential impact of this new national security system 
on our traditional notions of civil liberties, autonomy, and privacy. 
2.5 Future Directions 
National security research poses unique challenges and opportunities. 
Much of the established data mining and knowledge discovery literature, 
findings, and techniques need to be re-examined in light of the unique data 
and problem characteristics in the law enforcement and intelligence 
community. New text mining, spatial and temporal pattern mining, and 
criminal network analysis of relevance to national security are among some 
of the most pressing research areas. However, researchers cannot conduct 
research in a vacuum. Partnerships with local, state, and federal agencies 
need to be formed to obtain relevant test data and necessary domain 
expertise for IS1 research. Only after rigorous testing with scrubbed or 
anonymous data can selected techniques be field examined and verified by 
the domain experts (i.e., law enforcement personnel, intelligence analysts, 
and policy makers). These techniques should be used in actual investigations 
only after experts have confirmed their potential value. At this stage, the 
researcher-designed algorithms or systems are often much improved and 
refined, and are often operated and controlled by the domain experts with 
their own heuristics, know-how, and judgment. 
2.6 Questions for Discussion 
1. What are the newest and most promising data mining techniques and 
approaches? How much of the data mining research can be conducted 
using existing tools and software and how much should be built from 
scratch? 
An ISI Research Framework 23 
2. How can new, promising, and unique data mining techniques for national 
security be identified? What are some ways to develop an integrated, 
multi-disciplinary research team for algorithms development, system 
development, user interface design, user assessment, and organizational 
impact study? 
3. How can agency partners who are willing to collaborate, i.e., providing 
data and domain expertise, be identified? How should a win-win scenario 
for the research partnership be created? 
4. What are some ways and places to find help on privacy and civil liberties 
issues? How can rigorous data mining research be conducted in 
consideration of civil liberties? 
5. What are some ways to work with industry partners on national security 
research?

IS1 RESEARCH: LITERATURE REVIEW 
Chapter Overview 
In this chapter, we review the technical foundations of IS1 and the six classes 
of data mining technologies specified in our IS1 research framework: 
information sharing and collaboration, crime association mining, crime 
classification and clustering, intelligence text mining, spatial and temporal 
crime pattern mining, and criminal network analysis. We also summarize 
relevant research that addresses knowledge discovery in public safety and 
national security. 
ISI Research: Literature Review 2 7 
3.1 Information Sharing and Collaboration 
Information sharing across jurisdictional boundaries of intelligence and 
security agencies has been identified as one of the key foundations for 
securing national security (Office of Homeland Security, 2002). However, 
sharing and integrating information from distributed, heterogeneous, and 
autonomous data sources is a non-trivial task (Hasselbring, 2000; Rahm and 
Bernstein, 2001). In addition to legal and cultural issues regarding 
information sharing, it is often difficult to integrate and combine data that 
are organized in different schemas and stored in different database systems 
running on different hardware platforms and operating systems (Hasselbring, 
2000). Other data integration problems include: (1) name differences: same 
entity with different names; (2) mismatched domains: problems with units of 
measure or reference point; (3) missing data: incomplete data sources or 
different data available from different sources; and (4) object identification: 
no global ID values and no inter-database ID tables (Chen and Rotem, 
1998). 
Three approaches to data integration have been proposed: federation, 
warehousing, and mediation (Garcia-Molina et al., 2002). Database 
federation maintains data in their original, independent sources but provides 
a uniform data access mechanism (Buccella et al., 2003; Haas, 2002). Data 
warehousing is an integrated system in which copies of data from different 
data sources are migrated and stored to provide uniform access. Data 
mediation relies on "wrappers" to translate and pass queries from multiple 
data sources. The wrappers are "transparent" to an application so that the 
multiple databases appear to be a single database. These techniques are not 
mutually exclusive. Many hybrid approaches have been proposed (Jhingran 
et al., 2002). 
All these techniques are dependent, to a great extent, on the matching 
between different databases. The task of database matching can be broadly 
divided into schema-level and instance-level matching (Lim et al., 1996; 
Rahm and Bernstein, 2001). Schema-level matching is performed by 
aligning semantically corresponding columns between two sources. Various 
schema elements such as attribute name, description, data type, and 
constraints may be used to generate a mapping between the two schemas 
(Rahrn and Bernstein, 2001). For example, prior studies have used linguistic 
matchers to find similar attribute names based on synonyms, common 
substrings, pronunciation, and Soundex codes (Newcombe et al., 1959) to 
match attributes from different databases (Bell and Sethi, 2001). Instance- 
level or entity-level matching connects records describing a particular object 
in one database to records describing the same object in another database. 
Entity-level matching is frequently performed after schema-level matching is 
28 INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY INFORMATICS 
completed. Existing entity matching approaches include (1) key equivalence, 
(2) user specified equivalence, (3) probabilistic key equivalence, (4) 
probabilistic attribute equivalence, or (5) heuristic rules (Lim et al., 1996). 
Some of these information integration approaches have been used in law 
enforcement and intelligence agencies for investigation support. The 
COPLINK Connect system (Chen et al., 2003b) employed the database 
federation approach to achieve schema-level data integration. It provided a 
common COPLINK schema and a one-stop-shopping user interface to 
facilitate the access of different data sources from multiple police 
departments. Evaluation results showed that COPLINK Connect had 
improved performance over the Record Management System (RMS) of 
police data in system effectiveness, ease of use, and interface design (Chen 
et al., 2003b). Similarly, the Phoenix Police Department Reports (PPDR) is a 
web-based, federated intelligence system in which databases shared common 
schema (Dolotov and Strickler, 2003). The Bioterrorism Surveillance 
Systems developed at the University of South Florida, on the other hand, 
used data warehouses to integrate historical and real-time surveillance data 
and incrementally incorporated data from diverse disease sources (Berndt et 
al., 2004; Berndt et al., 2003). 
Integrating data at the entity level has also been difficult. In addition to 
existing key equivalence matching approaches and heuristic consolidation 
approaches (Goldberg and Senator, 1998), the use of the National Incident- 
Based Reporting System (NIBRS) (Federal Bureau of Investigation, 1992), a 
crime incident classification standard, has been proposed to enhance data 
sharing among law enforcement agencies (Faggiani and McLaughlin, 1999; 
Schroeder et al., 2003). In the Violent Crime Linkage Analysis System 
(ViCLAS) (Collins et al., 1998), data collection and encoding standards 
were used to capture more than 100 behavioral characteristics of offenders in 
serial violent crimes to address the problem of entity-level matching. 
Information sharing has also been undertaken in intelligence and security 
agencies through cross-jurisdictional collaborative systems. COPLINK 
Agent was run on top of the COPLINK Connect system (Chen et al., 2003b) 
and linked crime investigators who were working on related crime cases at 
different units to enhance collaboration (Zeng et al., 2003). It employed 
collaborative filtering approaches (Goldberg et al., 1992), which have been 
widely studied in commercial recommender systems, to identify law 
enforcement users who had similar search histories. Similar search histories 
might indicate that these users had similar information needs and thus were 
working on related crime cases. When one user searched for information 
about a crime or a suspect, the system would alert other users who worked 
on related cases so that these users could collaborate and share their 
information through other communication channels. The FALCON system 
ISI Research: Literature Review 29 
offered similar monitoring and alerting functionality (Brown, 1998b). Its 
collaboration capability, however, was relatively limited. Research has also 
been performed to mathematically model collaboration processes across law 
enforcement and intelligence jurisdictions to improve work productivity 
(Raghu et al., 2003; Zhao et al., 2003). Although information sharing and 
collaboration are not knowledge discovery per se, they prepare data for 
important subsequent analyses. 
3.2 Crime Association Mining 
Finding associations among data items is an important topic in 
knowledge discovery research. One of the most widely studied approaches is 
association rule mining, a process of discovering frequently occurring item 
sets in a database. Association rule mining is often used in market basket 
analysis where the objective is to find which products are bought with what 
other products (Agrawal et al., 1993; Mannila et al., 1994; Silverstein et al., 
1998). An association is expressed as a rule X 3 Y, indicating that item set 
X and item set Y occur together in the same transaction (Agrawal et al., 
1993). Each rule is evaluated using two probability measures, support and 
confidence, where support is defined as prob(XnY) and confidence as 
prob(XnY)lprob(X). For example, "diapers milk with 60% support and 
90% confidence" means that 60% of customers buy both diapers and milk in 
the same transaction and that 90% of the customers who buy diapers tend to 
also buy milk. 
In the intelligence and security domain, spatial association rule mining 
(Koperski and Han, 1995) has been proposed to extract cause-effect relations 
among geographically referenced crime data to identify environmental 
factors that attract crimes (Estivill-Castro and Lee, 2001). Moreover, the 
research on association mining is not limited to association rule mining but 
covers the extraction of a wide variety of relationships among crime data 
items. Crime association mining techniques can include incident association 
mining and entity association mining (Lin and Brown, 2003). 
The purpose of incident association mining is to find crimes that might 
be committed by the same offender so that unsolved crimes can be linked to 
solved crimes to identify the suspect. This technique is often used to solve 
serial crimes such as serial sexual offenses and serial homicide. However, 
finding associated crime incidents can be fairly time-consuming if it is 
performed manually. It is estimated that pairwise, manual comparisons on 
just a few hundred crime incidents would take more than 1 million human 
hours (Brown and Hagen, 2002). When the number of crime incidents is 
large, manual identification of associations between crimes is prohibitive in 
30 INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY INFORMATICS 
time. Two approaches, similarity-based and outlier-based, have been 
developed for incident association mining. 
Similarity-based methods detect associations between crime incidents by 
comparing crimes' features such as spatial locations of the incidents and 
offenders' modus operandi (MO), which often are regarded as an offender's 
"behavioral signature" (O'Hara and O'Hara, 1980). Expert systems relying 
on decision rules acquired from domain experts used to be a common 
approach to associating crime incidents (Badiru et al., 1988; Bowen, 1994; 
Brahan et al., 1998). However, as the collection of human-decision rules 
requires a large amount of knowledge engineering effort and the rules 
collected are often hard to update, the expert system approach has been 
replaced by more automated approaches. Brown and Hagen (Brown and 
Hagen, 2002) developed a total similarity measure between two crime 
records as a weighted sum of similarities of various crime features. For 
features such as an offender's eye color that takes on categorical values, they 
developed a similarity table that specified the similarity level for each pair of 
categorical values based on heuristics. Evaluation showed that this approach 
enhanced both accuracy and efficiency for associating crime records. 
Similarly, Wang et al. (Wang et al., 2003) proposed to measure similarity 
between a new crime incident and existing criminal information stored in 
police databases by representing the new incident as a query and existing 
criminal information as vector spaces. The vector space model is widely 
employed in information retrieval applications and various similarity 
measures could be used (Rasmussen, 1992). 
Unlike similarity-based methods which identify associations based on a 
number of crime features, the outlier-based method focuses only on the 
distinctive features of a crime (Lin and Brown, 2003). For example, in a 
series of robberies a Japanese sword was used as the weapon. Since a 
Japanese sword is a very uncommon weapon as opposed to other weapons 
such as shotguns, it is very likely that this series of robberies was committed 
by the same offender. Based on this outlier concept, crime investigators need 
to first cluster crime incidents into cells and then use an outlier score 
function to measure the distinctiveness of the incidents in a specific cell. If 
the outlier score of a cell is larger than a threshold value, the incidents 
contained in the cell are assumed to be associated and committed by the 
same offender. Evaluation showed that the outlier-based method was more 
effective than the similarity-based method proposed in (Brown and Hagen, 
2002). 
The task of finding and charting associations between crime entities such 
as persons, weapons, and organizations often is referred to as entity 
association mining (Lin and Brown, 2003) or link analysis (Sparrow, 1991) 
in law enforcement. The purpose is to find out how crime entities that appear 
ISI Research: Literature Review 
to be unrelated at the surface are actually linked to each other. Law 
enforcement officers and crime investigators throughout the world have long 
used link analysis to search for and analyze relationships between criminals. 
For example, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) used link analysis in 
the investigation of the Oklahoma City Bombing case and the Unabomber 
case to look for criminal associations and investigative leads (Schroeder et 
al., 2003). 
Three types of link analysis approaches have been suggested: heuristic- 
based, statistical-based, and template-based. Heuristic-based approaches 
rely on decision rules used by domain experts to determine whether two 
entities in question are related. For example, Goldberg and Senator 
(Goldberg and Senator, 1998) suggested that links or associations between 
individuals in financial transactions be created based on a set of heuristics, 
such as whether the individuals have shared addresses, shared bank 
accounts, or related transactions. This technique has been employed by the 
FinCEN system of the U.S. Department of the Treasury to detect money 
laundering transactions and activities (Goldberg and Senator, 1998; 
Goldberg and Wong, 1998). The COPLINK Detect system (Hauck et al., 
2002) employed a statistical-based approach called Concept Space (Chen 
and Lynch, 1992). This approach measures the weighted co-occurrence 
associations between records of entities (persons, organizations, vehicles, 
and locations) stored in crime databases. An association exists between a 
pair of entities if they appear together in the same criminal incident. The 
more frequently they occur together, the stronger the association is. Zhang et 
al. (Zhang et al., 2003) proposed to use a fuzzy resemblance function to 
calculate the correlation between two individuals' past financial transactions 
to detect associations between the individuals who might have been involved 
in a specific money laundering crime. If the correlation between two 
individuals is higher than a threshold value these two individuals are 
regarded as being related. The template-based approach has been primarily 
used to identify associations between entities extracted from textual 
documents such as police report narratives. Lee (Lee, 1998) developed a 
template-based technique using relation-specifying words and phrases. For 
example, the phrase "member of '  indicates an entity-entity association 
between an individual and an organization. Coady (Coady, 1985) proposed 
to use the PROLOG language to automatically derive rules of entity 
associations from text data and use the rules to detect associations in similar 
documents. Template-based approaches heavily rely on a fixed set of 
predefined patterns and rules, and thus may have a limited scope of 
application. 
32 INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY INFORMATICS 
3.3 Crime Classification and Clustering 
Classification is the process of mapping data items into one of several 
predefined categories based on attribute values of the items (Hand, 1981; 
Weiss and Kulikowski, 1991). Examples of classification applications 
include fraud detection (Chan and Stolfo, 1998), computer and network 
intrusion detection (Lee and Stolfo, 1998), bank failure prediction (Sarkar 
and Sriram, 2001), and image categorization (Fayyad et al., 1996). 
Classification is a type of supervised learning that consists of a training stage 
and a testing stage. Accordingly the dataset is divided into a training set and 
a testing set. The classifier is designed to "learn" from the training set 
classification models governing the membership of data items. Accuracy of 
the classifier is assessed using the testing set. 
Discriminant analysis (Eisenbeis and Avery, 1972), Bayesian models 
(Duda and Hart, 1973; Heckerman, 1995), decision trees (Quinlan, 1986, 
1993), artificial neural networks (Rumelhart et al., 1986), and support vector 
machines (SVM) (Vapnik, 1995) are widely used classification techniques. 
In discriminant analysis, the class membership of a data item is modeled as a 
function of the item's attribute values. Through regression analysis, a class 
membership discriminant function can be obtained and used to classify new 
data items. 
Bayesian classifiers assume all data attributes are conditionally 
independent given the class membership outcome. The task is to learn the 
conditional probabilities among the attributes given the class membership 
outcome. The learned model is then used to predict the class membership of 
new data items based on their attribute values. 
Decision tree classifiers organize decision rules learned from training 
data in the form of a tree. Algorithms such as ID3 (Quinlan, 1986, 1993) and 
C4.5 (Quinlan, 1993) are popular decision tree classifiers. 
An artificial neural network consists of interconnected nodes to imitate 
the functioning of neurons and synapses of human brains. It usually contains 
an input layer, with nodes taking on the attribute values of the data items, 
and an output layer, with nodes representing the class membership labels. 
Neural networks learn and encode knowledge through the connection 
weights. 
SVM is a novel learning classifier based on the Structural Risk 
Minimization principle from the computational learning theory. SVM is 
capable of handling millions of inputs and does not require feature selection 
(Cristianini and Shawe-Taylor, 2000). Each of these classification 
techniques has its advantages and disadvantages in terms of accuracy, 
efficiency, and interpretability. Researchers have also proposed hybrid 
approaches to combine these techniques (Kumar and Olmeda, 1999). 
ISI Research: Literature Review 33 
Several of these techniques have been applied in the intelligence and 
security domain to detect financial fraud and computer network intrusion. 
For example, to identify fraudulent financial transactions Aleskerov et al. 
(Aleskerov et al., 1997) employed neural networks to detect anomalies in 
customers' credit card transactions based on their transaction history. 
Hassibi (Hassibi, 2000) employed a feed-forward back-propagation neural 
network to compute the probability that a given transaction was fraudulent. 
Two types of intrusion detection, misuse detection and anomaly 
detection, have been studied in computer network security applications (Lee 
and Stolfo, 1998). Misuse detection identifies attacks by matching them to 
previously known attack patterns or signatures. Anomaly detection, on the 
other hand, identifies abnormal user behaviors based on historical data. Lee 
and Stolfo (Lee and Stolfo, 1998) employed decision rule induction 
approaches to classify sendmail system call traces into normal or abnormal 
traces. Ryan et al. (Ryan et al., 1998) developed a neural network-based 
intrusion detection system to detect unusual user activity based on the 
patterns of users' past system command usage. Stolfo et al. (Stolfo et al., 
2003) applied Bayesian classifiers to distinguish between normal email and 
sparnrning email. 
Unlike classification, clustering is a type of unsupervised learning. It 
groups similar data items into clusters without knowing their class 
membership. The basic principle is to maximize intra-cluster similarity while 
minimizing inter-cluster similarity (Jain et al., 1999). Clustering has been 
used in a variety of applications, including image segmentation (Jain and 
Flynn, 1996), gene clustering (Eisen et al., 1998), and document 
categorization (Chen et al., 1998; Chen et al., 1996). Various clustering 
methods have been developed, including hierarchical approaches such as 
complete-link algorithms (Defays, 1977), partitional approaches such as k- 
means (Anderberg, 1 973 ; Kohonen, 1 995), and Self-organizing Maps 
(SOM) (Kohonen, 1995). These clustering methods group data items based 
on different criteria and may not generate the same clustering results. 
Hierarchical clustering groups data items into a series of nested clusters and 
generates a tree-like dendrogram. Partitional clustering algorithms generate 
only one partition level rather than nested clusters. Partitional clustering is 
more efficient and scalable for large datasets than hierarchical clustering, but 
has the problem of determining the appropriate number of clusters (Jain et 
al., 1999). Different from the hierarchical and partitional clustering that 
relies on the similarity or proximity measures between data items, SOM is a 
neural network-based approach that directly projects multivariate data items 
onto two-dimensional maps. SOM can be used for clustering and visualizing 
data items and groups (Chen et al., 1996). 
34 INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY INFORMATICS 
The use of clustering methods in the law enforcement and security 
domains can be categorized into two types: crime incident clustering and 
criminal clustering. The purpose of crime incident clustering is to find a set 
of similar crime incidents based on an offender's behavioral traits or to find 
a geographical area with a high concentration of certain types of crimes. For 
example, Adderley and Musgrove (Adderley and Musgrove, 2001) 
employed the SOM approach to cluster sexual attack crimes based on a 
number of offender MO attributes (e.g., the precaution methods taken and 
the verbal themes during the crime) to identify serial sexual offenders. The 
clusters found were used to form offender profiles containing MO and other 
information such as offender motives and racial preferences when choosing 
victims. Similarly, Kangas et al. (Kangas et al., 2003) employed the SOM 
method to group crime incidents to identify serial murderers and sexual 
offenders. Brown (Brown, 1998a) proposed k-means and the nearest 
neighbor approach to clustering spatial data of crimes to find "hotspot" areas 
in a city. The spatial clustering methods are often used in "hotspot analysis," 
which will be reviewed in detail in Section 3.5. 
Criminal clustering is often used to identify groups of criminals who are 
closely related. Instead of using similarity measures, this type of clustering 
relies on relational strength that measures the intensiveness and frequency of 
relationships between offenders. Stolfo et al. (Stolfo et al., 2003) proposed to 
group email users that frequently communicate with each other into clusters 
so that unusual email behavior that violated the group communication 
patterns could be effectively detected. Offender clustering is more often used 
in criminal network analysis, which will be reviewed in detail in Section 3.6. 
3.4 Intelligence Text Mining 
A large amount of intelligence- and security-related data is represented in 
text forms such as police narrative reports, court transcripts, news clips, and 
web articles. Valuable information in such texts is often difficult to retrieve, 
access, and use for the purposes of crime investigation and counter- 
terrorism. It is desirable to automatically mine the text data to discover 
valuable knowledge about criminal or terrorism activities. 
Text mining has attracted increasing attention in recent years as natural 
language processing capabilities advance (Chen, 2001). An important task of 
text mining is information extraction, a process of identifying and extracting 
from free text select types of information such as entities, relationships, and 
events (Grishrnan, 2003). The most widely studied information extraction 
subfield is named-entity extraction. It helps automatically identify from text 
docun~ents the names of entities of interest, such as persons (e.g., "John 
Doe"), locations (e.g., "Washington, D.C."), and organizations (e.g., 
ISI Research: Literature Review 35 
"National Science Foundation"). It has also been extended to identify other 
text patterns, such as dates, times, number expressions, dollar amounts, 
email addresses, and web addresses (URLs). The Message Understanding 
Conference (MUC) series has been the major forum for researchers in this 
area, where researchers meet and compare the performance of their entity 
extraction approaches (Chinchor, 1998). 
Four major named-entity extraction approaches have been proposed: 
lexical-lookup, rule-based, statistical model, and machine learning. 
Lexical lookup. Most research systems maintain hand-crafted lexicons 
that contain lists of popular names for entities of interest, such as all 
registered organization names in the U.S., all person last names obtained 
from the government census data, etc. These systems work by looking up 
phrases in texts that match the items specified in their lexicons 
(Borthwick et al., 1998). 
Rule-based. Rule-based systems rely on hand-crafted rules to identify 
named entities. The rules may be structural, contextual, or lexical 
(Krupka and Hausman, 1998). An example rule would look like the 
following: 
capitalized last name + , + capitalizedJirst name =person name 
Although such human-created rules are usually of high quality, this 
approach may not be easy to apply to other entity types. 
Statistical model. Such systems often use statistical models to identify 
occurrences of certain cues or particular patterns for entities in texts. A 
training dataset is needed for a system to obtain the statistics. The 
statistical language model reported in (Witten et al., 1999) is an example 
for such systems. 
Machine learning. This type of system relies on machine learning 
algorithms rather than human-created rules to extract knowledge or 
identify patterns from text data. Examples of machine learning 
algorithms used in entity extraction include neural networks, decision 
trees (Baluja et al., 1999), Hidden Markov Model (Miller et al., 1998), 
and entropy maximization (Borthwick et al., 1998). 
Instead of relying on a single approach, most existing information 
extraction systems utilize a combination of two or more of these approaches. 
Many systems were evaluated at the MUC-7 Conference. The best systems 
were able to achieve over 90% in both precision and recall rates in extracting 
persons, locations, organizations, dates, times, currencies, and percentages. 
Recent years have seen research on named-entity extraction for 
intelligence and security applications (Patman and Thompson, 2003; Wang 
et al., 2004b). For example, Chau et al. (Chau et al., 2002) developed a 
36 INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY INFORMATICS 
neural network-based entity extraction system to identify person names, 
addresses, narcotic drugs, and personal property names from police report 
narratives. Rather than relying entirely on manual rule generation, this 
system combines lexical lookup, machine learning, and some hand-crafted 
rules. The system achieved over 70% precision and recall rates for person 
name and narcotic drug names. However, it was difficult to achieve 
satisfactory performance for addresses and personal properties because of 
their wide coverage. Sun et al. (Sun et al., 2003) converted the entity 
extraction problem into a classification problem to identify relevant entities 
from the MUC text collection in the terrorism domain. They first identified 
all noun phrases in a document and then used the support vector machine to 
classify these entity candidates based on both content and context features. 
The results showed that for the specific terrorism text collection the 
approach's performance in precision and F measure was comparable with 
AutoSlog (Riloff, 1996), one of the best entity extraction systems. 
Several news and event extraction systems have been reported recently, 
including Columbia's Newsblaster (McKeown et al., 2003) and Carnegie 
Mellon University's system (Yang et al., 1999), which automatically extract, 
categorize, and summarize events from international online news sources. 
Some of these systems can also work for multilingual documents and have 
great potential for automatic detection and tracking of terrorism events for 
intelligence purposes. 
3.5 Crime Spatial and Temporal Mining 
Most crimes, including terrorism, have significant spatial and temporal 
characteristics (Brantingham and Brantingham, 198 1). Analysis of spatial 
and temporal patterns of crimes has been one of the most important crime 
investigation techniques. It aims to gather intelligence about environmental 
factors that prevent or encourage crimes (Brantingham and Brantingham, 
1981), identify geographic areas of high crime concentration (Levine, 2000), 
and detect crime trends (Schumacher and Leitner, 1999). With the patterns 
found, effective and proactive control strategies, such as allocating the 
appropriate amount of police resources in certain areas at certain times, may 
be selected to prevent crimes. 
Spatial pattern analysis and geographical profiling of crimes play 
important roles in solving crimes (Rosmo, 1995). Three approaches for 
crime spatial pattern mining have been reported: visual approach, clustering 
approaches, and statistical approaches (Murray et al., 2001). The visual 
approach is also called crime mapping. It presents a city or region map 
annotated with various crime-related information. For example, a map can 
be color-coded to present the densities of a specific type of crime in different 
ISI Research: Literature Review 3 7 
geographical areas. Such an approach can help users visually detect the 
relationship between spatial features and crime occurrences. 
The clustering approach has been used in hotspot analysis, a process of 
automatically identifying areas with high crime concentration. This type of 
analysis helps law enforcement effectively allocate police efforts to reduce 
crimes in hotspot areas. Partitional clustering algorithms such as the k-means 
methods are often used for finding crime hotspots (Murray and Estivill- 
Castro, 1998). For example, Schumacher and Leitner (Schumacher and 
Leitner, 1999) used the k-means algorithm to identify hotspots in the 
downtown areas of Baltimore. Comparing the hotspots of different years, 
they found spatial patterns of the displacement of crimes after 
redevelopment of the downtown area. Corresponding proactive strategies 
were then suggested based on the patterns found. Although they are efficient 
and scalable compared with hierarchical clustering algorithms, partitional 
clustering algorithms usually require the user to predefine the number of 
clusters to be found. This is not always feasible, however (Grubesic and 
Murray, 2001). Accordingly, researchers have tried to use statistical 
approaches to conduct hotspot analysis or to test the significance of hotspots 
(Craglia et al., 2000). The test statistics Gi (Getis and Ord, 1992; Ord and 
Getis, 1995) and Moran's I (Moran, 1950), which are used to test the 
significance of spatial autocorrelation, can be used to detect hotspots. If a 
variable is correlated with itself through space it is said to be spatially 
autocorrelated. For example, Ratchliffe and McCullagh (Ratchliffe and 
McCullagh, 1999) employed the Gi and Gi * statistics to identify the hotspots 
of residential burglary and motor vehicle crimes in a city. Compared with a 
domain expert's perception of the hotspots, this approach was shown to be 
effective. 
Statistical approaches have also been used in crime prediction 
applications. Based on the spatial choice theory (McFadden, 1973), Xue and 
Brown (Xue and Brown, 2003) modeled the probability of a criminal 
choosing a target location as a function of multiple spatial characteristics of 
the location such as family density per unit area and distance to highway. 
Using regression analysis they predicted the locations of future crimes in a 
city. Evaluation showed that their models significantly outperformed 
conventional hotspot models. Similarly, Brown et al. (Brown et al., 2004) 
built a logistic regression model to predict suicide bombing in counter- 
terrorism applications. 
Conlmercially available graphical information systems (GIs) and crime 
mapping tools such as ArcView and MapInfo have been widely used in law 
enforcement and intelligence agencies for analyzing and visualizing spatial 
patterns of crimes. Geographical coordinate information as well as various 
spatial features, such as the distance between the location of a crime to major 
38 INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY INFORMATICS 
roads and police stations, is often used in GIs (Harris, 1990; Weisburd and 
McEwen, 1997). 
Research on temporal patterns of crimes is relatively scarce in 
comparison to crime mapping. Two major approaches have been reported, 
namely visualization and the statistical approach. Visualization approaches 
present individual or aggregated temporal features of crimes using periodic 
view or timeline view. Common methods for viewing periodic data include 
sequence charts, point charts, bar charts, line charts, and spiral graphs 
displayed in 2D or 3D (Tufte, 1983). In a timeline view, a sequence of 
events is presented based on its temporal order. For example, LifeLines 
provides the visualization of a patient's medical history using a timeline 
view. The Spatial Temporal Visualizer (STV) (Buetow et al., 2003) 
seamlessly incorporated periodic view, timeline view, and GIs view in the 
system to provide support to crime investigations. Visualization approaches 
rely on human users to interpret data presentations and to find temporal 
patterns of events. Statistical approaches, on the other hand, build statistical 
models from observations to capture the temporal patterns of events. For 
instance, Brown and Oxford (Brown and Oxford, 2001) developed several 
statistical models, including log-normal regression model, Poisson 
regression model, and cumulative logistic regression model, to predict the 
number of breaking and entering crimes. The log-normal regression model 
was found to fit the data best (Brown and Oxford, 2001). 
3.6 Criminal Network Analysis 
Criminals seldom operate alone but instead interact with one another to 
carry out various illegal activities. Relationships between individual 
offenders form the basis for organized crime and are essential for the 
effective operation of a criminal enterprise. Criminal enterprises can be 
viewed as a network consisting of nodes (individual offenders) and links 
(relationships). In criminal networks, groups or teams may exist within 
which members have close relationships. One group also may interact with 
other groups to obtain or transfer illicit goods. Moreover, individuals play 
different roles in their groups. For example, some key members may act as 
leaders to control the activities of a group. Some others may serve as 
gatekeepers to ensure the smooth flow of information or illicit goods. 
Structural network patterns in terms of subgroups, between-group 
interactions, and individual roles thus are important to understanding the 
organization, structure, and operation of criminal enterprises. Such 
knowledge can help law enforcement and intelligence agencies disrupt 
criminal networks and develop effective control strategies to combat 
organized crimes. For example, removal of central members in a network 
ISI Research: Literature Review 39 
may effectively upset the operational network and put a criminal enterprise 
out of action (Baker and Faulkner, 1993; McAndrew, 1999; Sparrow, 199 1). 
Subgroups and interaction patterns between groups are helpful for finding a 
network's overall structure, which often reveals points of vulnerability 
(Evan, 1972; Ronfeldt and Arquilla, 2001). For a centralized structure such 
as a star or a wheel, the point of vulnerability lies in its central members. A 
decentralized network such as a chain or clique, however, does not have a 
single point of vulnerability and thus may be more difficult to disrupt. 
Social Network Analysis (SNA) provides a set of measures and 
approaches for structural network analysis (Wasserman and Faust, 1994). 
These techniques were originally designed to discover social structures in 
social networks (Wasserman and Faust, 1994) and are especially appropriate 
for studying criminal networks (McAndrew, 1999; Sparrow, 1991). Studies 
involving evidence mapping in fraud and conspiracy cases have employed 
SNA measures to identify central members in criminal networks (Baker and 
Faulkner, 1993; Saether and Canter, 2001). In general, SNA is capable of 
detecting subgroups, identifying central individuals, discovering between- 
group interaction patterns, and uncovering a network's structure. 
Subgroup detection. With networks represented in a matrix format, the 
matrix permutation approach and cluster analysis have been employed to 
detect underlying groups that are not otherwise apparent in data 
(Wasserman and Faust, 1994). Burt (Burt, 1976) proposed to apply 
hierarchical clustering methods based on a structural equivalence 
measure (Lorrain and White, 1971) to partition a social network into 
positions in which members have similar structural roles. Xu and Chen 
(Xu and Chen, 2003) employed hierarchical clustering to detect criminal 
groups in narcotics networks based on the relational strength between 
criminals. 
Central member identij2ation. Centrality deals with the roles of network 
members. Several measures, such as degree, betweenness, and closeness, 
are related to centrality (Freeman, 1979). The degree of a particular node 
is its number of direct links; its betweenness is the number of geodesics 
(shortest paths between any two nodes) passing through it; and its 
closeness is the sum of all the geodesics between the particular node and 
every other node in the network. Although these three measures are all 
intended to illustrate the importance or centrality of a node, they interpret 
the roles of network members differently. An individual having a high 
degree measurement, for instance, may be inferred to have a leadership 
function, whereas an individual with a high level of betweenness may be 
seen as a gatekeeper in the network. Baker and Faulkner employed these 
three measures, especially degree, to find the key individuals in a price- 
40 INTELLIGENCE AND SECURTTY INFORMATICS 
fixing conspiracy network in the electrical equipment industry (Baker 
and Faulkner, 1993). Krebs found that, in the network consisting of the 
nineteen September 1 lth hijackers, Mohamed Atta had the highest degree 
score (Krebs, 2001). 
Discovery of patterns of interaction. Patterns of interaction between 
subgroups can be discovered using an SNA approach called blockmodel 
analysis (Arabie et al., 1978). Given a partitioned network, blockmodel 
analysis determines the presence or absence of an association between a 
pair of subgroups by comparing the density of the links between them at 
a predefined threshold value. In this way, blockmodeling introduces 
summarized individual interaction details into interactions between 
groups so that the overall structure of the network becomes more 
apparent. 
SNA also includes visualization methods that present networks 
graphically. The Smallest Space Analysis (SSA) approach (Wassennan and 
Faust, 1994), a branch of Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS), is used 
extensively in SNA to produce two-dimensional representations of social 
networks. In a graphical portrayal of a network produced by SSA, the 
stronger the association between two nodes or two groups, the closer they 
appear on the graph; the weaker the association, the farther apart they are 
(McAndrew, 1999). Several network analysis tools, such as Analyst's 
Notebook (Klerks, 2001), Netmap (Goldberg and Senator, 1998), and 
Watson (Anderson et al., 1994), can automatically draw a graphical 
representation of a criminal network. However, they do not provide much 
structural analysis functionality and rely on investigators' manual 
examinations to extract structural patterns. 
The above-reviewed six classes of KDD techniques constitute the key 
components of our proposed IS1 research framework. Our focus on the KDD 
methodology, however, does not exclude other approaches. For example, 
studies using simulation and multi-agent models have shown promise in the 
"what-if' analysis of the robustness of terrorist and criminal networks 
(Carley et al., 2003; Carley et al., 2002). 
3.7 Future Directions 
There are many opportunities for researchers from different disciplines to 
contribute to the science of ISI. Computer science researchers in databases, 
artificial intelligence, data mining, algorithms, networking, and grid 
computing are poised to contribute significantly to core information 
infrastructure, integration, and analysis research of relevance to ISI. 
Information systems, information science, and management science 
ISI Research: Literature Review 41 
researchers could help develop the quantitative, system, and information 
theory-based methodologies needed for the systematic study of national 
security. Cognitive science, behavioral research, management and policy, 
and legal disciplines are critical to the understanding of the individual, 
group, organizational, and societal impacts and the creation of effective 
national security policies. All the abovementioned academic disciplines need 
to work closely with the domain experts in law enforcement, public safety, 
emergency response, and the intelligence community. 
3.8 Questions for Discussion 
What are the core technical foundations for IS1 research? What are the 
undergraduate and graduate courses in various disciplines that can help 
contribute to this understanding? 
What are the major conferences, journals, and magazines that publish and 
promote IS1 research? Are there professional ISI-related societies or 
work groups? 
What are the major research centers, laboratories, non-profit agencies, 
and government programs that provide training, education, and research 
resources of relevance to ISI? 
Are there government sponsored national security-related training and 
fellowship programs? What about some of the intern, co-op, and 
employment opportunities for an IT career in national security?

NATIONAL SECURITY CRITICAL 
MISSION AREAS AND CASE STUDIES 
Chapter Overview 
This chapter provides an overview for the next six chapters. Based on 
research conducted at the University of Arizona's Artificial Intelligence Lab 
and its affiliated NSF COPLINK Center for Law Enforcement and 
Intelligence Research, we review seventeen case studies that are relevant to 
the six homeland security critical mission areas described earlier. More 
details about each case study follow in each of the next six chapters. 
National Security Critical Mission Areas 45 
4.1 Introduction 
In response to the challenges of national security, the Artificial 
Intelligence Lab and its affiliated NSF COPLINK Center for Law 
Enforcement and Intelligence Research at the University of Arizona have 
developed many research projects over the past decade to address the six 
critical mission areas identified in the "National Strategy for Homeland 
Security" report (Office of Homeland Security, 2002): intelligence and 
warning, border and transportation security, domestic counter-terrorism, 
protecting critical infrastructure and key assets, defending against 
catastrophic terrorism, and emergency preparedness and responses. The 
main goal of the Arizona lablcenter is to develop information and knowledge 
management technologies appropriate for capturing, accessing, analyzing, 
visualizing, and sharing law enforcement- and intelligence-related 
information (Chen et al., 2003~). 
We demonstrate through seventeen case studies how critical mission 
issues could be addressed using the knowledge discovery approach. For each 
case study we discuss its relevance to national security missions, data 
characteristics, technologies used, and select evaluation results. Quantitative 
studies focused primarily on the performance of the techniques in terms of 
effectiveness, accuracy, efficiency, usefulness, etc. In qualitative studies, we 
summarize and report comments and feedback from our domain experts. We 
also suggest further readings for each case study. 
4.2 Intelligence and Warning 
Detecting potential terrorist attacks or crimes is possible and feasible 
with the help of information technology. By analyzing the communication 
and activity patterns among terrorists and their contacts (i.e., terrorist 
networks), detecting deceptive identities, or employing other surveillance 
and monitoring techniques, intelligence and warning systems may issue 
timely, critical alerts to prevent attacks or crimes from occurring. 
We present four case studies of relevance to intelligence and warning in 
Chapter 5. In Case Study 1, we report a taxonomy of identity deceptions 
based on police criminal records and propose an entity-matching technique 
to detect deception. In Case Study 2, we report on the Dark Web Portal 
project, which collects open source terrorism web site information based on 
select spidering and portal techniques. Case Study 3 summarizes web 
spidering and link analysis techniques adopted to analyze the presence of the 
Jihad on the web. Based on high-quality open source (news) generated 
terrorist information, Case Study 4 summarizes topological analysis research 
performed for the Al-Qaeda terrorist network.

4.3 Border and Transportation Security 
We believe that we can greatly improve the capabilities of counter- 
terrorism and crime-fighting by creating a "smart border," where 
information from multiple sources is integrated and analyzed to help locate 
wanted terrorists or criminals. Technologies such as information sharing and 
integration, collaboration and communication, and biometrics and speech 
recognition will be greatly needed in such smart borders. 
As shown in Table 4-2, Chapter 6 will review two case studies of 
relevance to border and transportation security. Case Study 5 reports on the 
BorderSafe project's information sharing and integration effort based on 
multiple local law enforcement criminal incident records. Case Study 6 
reports topological network analysis performed on 
jurisdictional narcotic networks in the Southwest.

4.4 Domestic Counter-terrorism 
As terrorists, both international and domestic, may be involved in local 
crimes, state and local law enforcement agencies are also contributing to the 
homeland security missions by investigating and prosecuting crimes. 
Information technologies that help find cooperative relationships between 
criminals and their interactive patterns would also be helpful for analyzing 
domestic terrorism. 
Table 4-3 summarizes four case studies of relevance to counter-terrorism 
research (reported in Chapter 7). Case Study 7 reports on the COPLINK 
Detect system that helps identify criminal associations based on law 
enforcement data. Case Study 8 reports on gang and narcotic criminal 
networks analysis based on selected social network analysis and clustering 
techniques. Case Study 9 reports how domestic extremist groups use the web 
to disseminate their ideology, recruit members, and support 
communications. Case Study 10 reports on a network topological study that 
analyzes various dark networks including: narcotic networks, terrorist 
networks, and terrorist web sites.

4.5 Protecting Critical Infrastructure and Key Assets 
Cyber infrastructure such as the Internet may be vulnerable to intrusions 
and inside threats. Criminals and terrorists are increasingly using cyberspace 
to conduct illegal activities, share ideology, solicit funding, and recruit. In 
addition to physical devices such as sensors and detectors, advanced 
information technologies are needed to model the normal behaviors of the 
usage of these systems and then use the models to distinguish abnormal 
behaviors from normal behaviors. One aspect of protecting cyber 
infrastructure is to determine the source and identity of unwanted threats or 
intrusions. 
We report on three case studies relevant to authorship identification 
based on multilingual messages (e.g., email and bulletin board messages) 
posted on the Internet. Case Study 11 reports authorship language models 
developed in English and Chinese. Case Study 12 reports how selected 
"writeprint" features are determined based on feature selection techniques.

4.6 Defending Against Catastrophic Terrorism 
Biological attacks may cause contamination, infectious disease 
outbreaks, and significant loss of life. Information systems that can 
efficiently and effectively collect, access, analyze, and report data about 
catastrophe-leading events can help prevent, detect, respond to, and manage 
these attacks. Case Study 14 reports on the BioPortal project that aims to 
develop an infectious disease and bioagent information sharing and analysis 
framework. Select West Nile Virus, botulism, and foot-and-mouth disease 
data from several state public heath departments have been incorporated.

4.7 Emergency Preparedness and Response 
In addition to systems that are designed to defend against catastrophes, 
information technologies that help optimize response plans, identify experts, 
train response professionals, and manage consequences are beneficial in the

4.8 Future Directions 
Over the past decade, through the generous funding support provided by 
the NSF, NIJ, DHS, and CIA, the University of Arizona Artificial 
Intelligence Lab and COPLINK Center have expanded their national 
security research from COPLINK to BorderSafe, Dark Web, and BioPortal. 
Based on a unique partnership model with local, state, and federal agencies 
in law enforcement (e.g., Tucson Police Department, Phoenix Police 
Department), homeland security (e.g., Customs and Border Protection), 
intelligence (e.g., DIA, CIA, and NSA), and disease informatics (e.g., New 
York and California Departments of Public Health) we have been able to 
make significant scientific advances and contributions in national security. 
The BorderSafe project will continue to explore IS1 issues of relevance to 
creating "smart borders." The Dark Web project aims to archive open source 
terrorism information in multiple languages to support terrorism research 
and policy studies. The BioPortal project has begun to create an information 
sharing, analysis, and visualization framework for infectious diseases and 
bioagents. We hope to continue to contribute in IS1 research in the next 
decade. 
4.9 Questions for Discussion 
1. What are some ways to achieve balance between basic and applied 
research in national security? How can important and emerging national 
security problems be identified? 
2. What are some ways to identify government partners who can provide 
datasets and domain expertise? How can their cooperation be solicited? 
3. How can academic research prototypes be turned into operational 
systems of use to national security agency partners? What are the efforts 
involved and resources needed? 
Chapter 5 
INTELLIGENCE AND WARNING 
Chapter Overview 
Although terrorism depends on surprise, terrorist attacks are not random but 
require careful planning, preparation, and cooperation before execution. To 
avoid being preempted by authorities, terrorists may disguise their true 
identities or hide their activities with their illegal objectives and intents 
behind other legal activities. Similarly, criminals may try to minimize the 
possibility of being identified and captured by using falsified identities. To 
detect the hidden intents and potential for future attacks or offenses is the 
main goal of intelligence and warning systems. In this section we present 
four case studies addressing the intelligence and warning needs. 
Intelligence and Warning 
5.1 Case Study 1: Detecting Deceptive Criminal Identities 
It is a common practice for criminals to lie about the particulars of their 
identity, such as name, date of birth, address, and social security number, in 
order to deceive a police investigator. The ability to validate identity can be 
used as a warning mechanism as the deception signals the intent to commit 
future offenses. In this case study we focus on uncovering patterns of 
criminal identity deception based on actual criminal records and suggest an 
algorithmic approach to revealing deceptive identities (Wang et al., 2004a). 
Data used in this study were authoritative criminal identity records 
obtained from the Tucson Police Department (TPD). These records were 
structured database entries containing criminal identity information, such as 
name, date of birth (DOB), address, identification number (e.g., social 
security number), race, weight, and height. Over 1.3 million criminal 
identity records were stored in the TPD databases. In order to study the 
patterns of criminal identity deception, we selected from the TPD database 
372 records involving 24 criminals -- each having one real identity record 
and several deceptive records. Guided by a veteran police detective with 
over 30 years of service in law enforcement, we carefully examined these 
372 records and found that deception mostly occurred in specific attributes: 
name, address, birth date, and ID number. The identity deception patterns in 
this dataset are shown in Figure 5-1. 
Name deception, occurring in most deceptive cases, includes giving a 
false first name and a true last name or vice versa, changing the middle 
initial, giving a name pronounced similarly but spelled differently, etc. 
Deception on DOB can consist of, for example, switching places between 
the month of birth and the day of birth. Similarly, ID deception is often made 
by changing a few digits of a social security number or by switching their 
places. In residency deception, criminals usually change only one portion of 
the address. For example, we found that in about 87% of cases criminals 
provided a false street number along with the true street direction, street 
name, or street type. 
To automatically detect deceptive identity records, we employed a 
similarity-based association mining method to extract associated (similar) 
record pairs. Based on the deception patterns found we selected four 
attributes, name, DOB, SSN, and address, for our analysis. We compared 
and calculated the similarity between the values of corresponding attributes 
of each pair of records. If two records were significantly similar we assumed 
that at least one of these two records was deceptive. 
Because the selected four attributes have mostly string values, we 
compared two attribute values based on their edit distance (Levenshtein, 
1966) and Soundex code (Newcombe et al., 1959). The edit distance 
58 INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY INFORMATICS 
between two strings is the minimum number of single character insertions, 
deletions, and substitutions required to transform one string into the other. 
Soundex code represents the phonetic pattern of a string. For example, 
"PEARSE" and "PIERCE" are both coded as "P620." To detect both 
spelling and phonetic variations between two name strings, edit distance 
similarity and Soundex similarity were computed separately. In order to 
capture name exchange deception, similarities were also computed based on 
different sequences of first name and last name. We took the similarity value 
from the sequence that had the maximal value between two names. We used 
only edit distance to compare non-phonetic attributes of DOB, SSN, and 
address. Each similarity value was normalized between 0 and 1. The 
similarity value over all four attributes was calculated using a normalized 
Euclidean distance function. 
Figure 5-1. Identity deception patterns. Each percentage number represents the proportion of 
records that contain the particular type of deception in the selected datasct. 
In order to test the performance of our approach, another sample 
containing 120 criminal records with identified dcception was chosen from 
the TPD database. We ignored records with missing values. The 120 records 
involved 44 criminals, each of whom had an average of three records in the 
sample set. Some data was used to train and test our algorithm so that 
records pointing to the same suspect could be associated with each other. 
Training and testing were validated by a standard hold-out sampling method. 
Intelligence and Warning 59 
Of the 120 records in the testbed, 80 (213) were used for training the 
algorithm, while the remaining 40 were used for testing purposes. 
A similarity matrix was built for all training records. Using the similarity 
values in the matrix, threshold values were searched to distinguish between 
the similar pairs of records and the dissimilar pairs. Accuracy rates for 
correctly recognized similar pairs of records using different threshold values 
are shown in Table 5-1. When the threshold similarity value was set to 0.52, 
our algorithm achieved its highest accuracy of 97.4%, with relatively small 
false negative and false positive rates, both of which were 2.6%. 
A similarity matrix was also built for the 40 testing records. By applying 
the optimal threshold value to the testing similarity matrix, records having a 
similarity value of more than 0.52 were considered to be pointing to the 
same offender and were associated together. The accuracy of association in 
the testing dataset is shown in Table 5-2. The result shows that the algorithm 
is effective (with an accuracy level of 94%) in linking deceptive records 
pointing to the same offender. 
** False ~ositive: consider similar records as dissimilar ones. 
While the above case study showed promising results, much more 
research is needed for deception detection, which we believe is a unique and 
critical problem for ISI.

terrorist organizations may also connect to one another through hyperlinks, 
forming a "dark web." We are building an intelligent web portal, called Dark 
Web Portal, to help terrorism researchers collect, access, analyze, and 
understand terrorist groups (Chen et al., 2004c; Reid et al., 2004). This 
project consists of three major components: Dark Web testbed building, 
Dark Web link analysis, and Dark Web Portal building. 
5.2.1. Dark Web Testbed Building 
Relying on reliable governmental sources such as the Anti-Defamation 
League (ADL), FBI, and United States Committee for a Free Lebanon 
(USCFL), we identified 224 U.S. domestic terrorist groups and 440 
international terrorist groups. For U.S. domestic groups, group-generated 
URLs can be found in FBI reports and the Google Directory. For 
international groups, we used the group names as queries to search major 
search engines such as Google and manually identified the group-created 
URLs from the result lists. To ensure that our testbed covered major regions 
in the world, we sought the assistance of language experts in English, 
Arabic, and Spanish to help us collect URLs in several major regions. All 
URLs collected were manually checked by experts to make sure that they 
were created by terrorist groups. After the URL of a group was identified, 
we used the SpidersRUs toolkit, a multilingual digital library building tool 
developed by our lab, to collect all the web pages under that URL and store 
them in our testbed. Table 5-3 shows a summary of web pages collected 
from three rounds of spidering (performed bi-monthly). 
5.2.2. Dark Web Link Analysis and Visualization 
Terrorist groups are not atomized individuals but actors linked to each 
other through complex networks of direct or mediated exchanges. 
Identifying how relationships between groups are formed and dissolved in 
the terrorist group network would enable us to decipher the social milieu and 
communication channels among terrorist groups across different 
jurisdictions. Previous studies have shown that the link structure of the web 
represents a considerable amount of latent human annotation (Gibson et al., 
1998). Thus, by analyzing and visualizing hyperlink structures between 
terrorist-generated web sites and their content, we could discover the 
structure and organization of terrorist group networks, capture network 
dynamics, and understand their emerging activities.

5.2.3. Dark Web Portal Building 
Using the Dark Web Portal, users are able to quickly locate specific dark 
web information in the testbed through keyword search. To address the 
information overload problem, the Dark Web Portal is designed with post- 
retrieval components. A modified version of a text summarizer called 
TXTRACTOR, which uses sentence-selection heuristics to rank and select 
important text segments (McDonald and Chen, 2002), has been added into 
the Dark Web Portal. The summarizer can flexibly summarize web pages 
using three or five sentences, so that users can quickly get the main idea of a 
web page without having to read though it. A categorizer organizes the 
search results into various folders labeled by the key phrases extracted by the 
Arizona Noun Phraser (AZNP) (Tolle and Chen, 2000) from the page 
summaries or titles, thereby facilitating the understanding of different groups 
of web pages. A visualizer clusters web pages into colored regions using the 
Kohonen self-organizing map (SOM) algorithm (Kohonen, 1995), thus 
reducing the information overload problem when a large number of search 
results are obtained. Post-retrieval analysis could help reduce the 
information overload problem. However, without addressing the language 
barrier problem, researchers are limited to the data in their native languages 
and cannot filly utilize the multilingual information in our testbed. To 
address this problem, we added a cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) 
component into the portal. Based on our previous research, we have 
62 INTELLIGENCE AND SECUMTY INFORMATICS 
developed a dictionary-based CLIR system for use in the Dark Web Portal. 
It currently accepts English queries and retrieves documents in English, 
Spanish, Chinese, and Arabic. Another component that will be added to the 
Dark Web Portal is a machine translation (MT) component, which will 
translate the multilingual information retrieved by the CLIR component back 
into the users' native languages. 
We show a sample search session in the figures below. Suppose the user 
is interested in the terrorist group "Ku Klux Klan" and uses it as a search 
term. Two types of search forms are available: simple search and advanced 
search (see Figure 5-2). Our user chose to use the simple search first. The 
advanced mode gives users more options to refine their search. For example, 
the user can specify web pages with the exact phrase. In addition, the user 
can restrict the results within a few terrorist categories or choose to search a 
particular file type, such as PDF or Word files.

Figure 5-2b. U.S. domestic (English) advanced search interface. 
By hitting the "Find Results" button, the top 20 results are displayed (see 
Figure 5-3). On the top of the result page it shows a list of "suggested 
keywords," such as "Aryan Nations" and "David Duke," which helps the 
user to expand or refine the query. Along with the web page result display, 
our portal also presents the terrorist group name and the corresponding 
group category. As terrorist group web pages may often disappear, "Cached 
Pages" for each web page collected at different time periods are provided 
(e.g., 2004/03). Additionally, the user can view web pages, PDF files, or 
Word files by clicking the corresponding links. 
As terrorist groups continue to use the Internet as their communication, 
recruiting, and propaganda tool, a systematic and system-aided approach to 
studying their presence on the web is critically needed.

5.3 Case Study 3: Jihad on the Web 
With weekly news coverage of excerpts from videos produced and web 
cast by terrorists, it has become clear that terrorists have further exploited 
the Internet beyond routine communication and propaganda operations to 
better influence the outside world (Arquilla & Rondeldt, 1996). Some 
terrorism researchers posited that terrorists have used the Internet as a 
broadcast platform for the "terrorist news network," which is an effective 
tactic because they can reach a broad audience with relatively little chance of 
detection (Elison, 2000; Tsfati & Weimann, 2002; Weinmann, 2004). 
Although this alternate side of the Internet, referred to as the "Dark Web," 
has recently received extensive government and media attention, systematic 
understanding of how terrorists use the Internet for their campaign of terror 
is very limited. 
In this study, we explore an integrated computer-based approach to 
harvesting and analyzing web sites produced or maintained by Islamic Jihad 
extremist groups or their sympathizers to deepen our understanding of how 
Intelligence and Warning 65 
Jihad terrorists use the Internet, especially the World Wide Web, in their 
terror campaigns. More specifically, we built a high-quality Jihad terrorism 
web collection using a web harvesting approach and conducted hyperlink 
analysis on this collection to reveal various facets of Jihad terrorism web 
usage. We hope to supplement existing high-quality but manually-driven 
terrorism research with a systematic, automated web spidering and mining 
methodology. 
5.3.1. Building the Jihad Web Collection 
To guarantee that our collection is comprehensive and representative, we 
take a three-step systematic approach to construct our collection: 
1. Identzjjing seed URLs and backlink expansion: The first task is to find a 
small set of high-quality Jihad web sites. To identify terrorist groups, we 
completely relied on the U.S. Department of State's list of foreign 
terrorist organizations. In particular, we only selected Middle-Eastern 
organizations from that list for this study. After identifying the terrorist 
groups in the Middle-East region, we manually searched major search 
engines to find the web sites of these groups. Our goal was not to 
construct a comprehensive list of URLs, but merely to compile a small 
list of high-quality URLs that can serve as the seeds for backlink 
expansion. The backlinks of these URLs were automatically identified 
through Google and Yahoo backline search services and a collection of 
88 web sites was automatically retrieved. 
2. Manual collectionJltering: Because bogus or unrelated terrorist sites can 
make their way into our collection, we developed a manual filtering 
process based on evidence and clues in the web sites. Aside from sites 
which explicitly identify themselves as the official sites of a terrorist 
organization or one of its members, a web site that contains praise of or 
adopts ideologies espoused by a terrorist group is included in our 
collection. 
Extending search: To ensure the comprehensiveness of our collection we 
augment the collection by means of expanded searches. Based on the 26 
web sites identified in the previous step, we constructed a small lexicon 
of commonly-used Jihad terms with the help of Arabic language 
speakers. Examples of highly relevant keywords included in the lexicon 
are: "%& s- lr"  ("Crusader's War7'), "&+-JJ'' ("Moujahedin"), "Yl" 
("Infidels"), etc. This lexicon is utilized to perform expanded searches. 
The same rules used in the filtering process are used here to discern fake 
and unrelated web sites. As a result, our final Jihad web collection 
66 INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY INFORMATICS 
contains 109,477 Jihad web documents including HTML pages, plain 
text files, PDF documents, and Microsoft Word documents. 
5.3.2. Hyperlink Analysis on the Jihad Web Collection 
We believe the exploration of hidden Jihad web communities can give 
insight into the nature of real-world relationships and communication 
channels between terrorist groups (Weimann, 2004). Uncovering hidden web 
communities involves calculating a similarity measure between all pairs of 
web sites in our collection. We define similarity as a function of the number 
of hyperlinks in web site "A" that point to web site "B," and vice versa. In 
addition, a hyperlink is weighted proportionally to how deep it appears in the 
web site hierarchy. The similarity matrix is then used as input to a Multi- 
Dimensional Scaling (MDS) algorithm (Torgerson, 1952), which generates a 
two dimensional graph of the web sites. The proximity of nodes in the graph 
reflects their similarity level. 
As shown in Figure 5-4, domain experts recognized six clusters 
representing hyperlinked communities in the network. On the left side of the 
network resides the Hizbollah cluster. Hizbollah is a Lebanese militant 
organization. Established in 1982 during the Israeli invasion of Lebanon, the 
group routinely attacked Israeli military personnel until their pullout from 
south Lebanon in 2000. A cluster of web sites of Palestinian organizations 
occupies the bottom-left corner of the network, including: Hamas, Al-Aqsa 
Martyr's Brigades, and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. An interesting 
observation here is the close link between the Hizbollah community and the 
Palestinian militant groups' community. Hizbollah has traditionally 
sympathized with the Palestinian cause. 
On the top-left corner sits the Hizb-ut-Tahrir cluster. Hizb-ut-Tahrir is a 
political party with branches in many countries in the Middle-East and in 
Europe. Although the group is believed to be associated with Al-Qaeda, an 
apparent relationship between the two groups has not been proven. Looking 
at the bottom-right corner, one can see a cluster of Al-Qaeda affiliated sites. 
This cluster has links to two radical Palestinian web sites. Al-Qaeda 
sympathizes with Palestinian groups and some Palestinian Islamist groups 
like Hamas and Islamic Jihad share the same Salafi ideology with Al-Qaeda. 
In the top-right corner, the Jihad Sympathizers web community includes web 
sites maintained by sympathizers of the Global Salafi movement. For 
example, "kavkazcenter.net" and "clearguidance.com" are two web sites 
maintained by sympathizers of the Chechen rebels. As expected, the 
sympathizers' community does not have any links to Hizbollah's community 
as they follow radically different ideologies.

Visualizing hyperlinked communities can lead to a better understanding

between terrorist groups. 
5.4 Case Study 4: Analyzing the Al-Qaeda Network 
As part of the worldwide Islamic revivalist movement, a number of 
terrorist organizations have targeted the West. Terrorism and terrorist attacks 
pose severe threats and have brought significant damage to the whole world. 
Only with an in-depth understanding of terrorism and terrorist organizations 
can we defend against the threats. Because terrorist organizations often 
operate in a network fornl in which individual terrorists cooperate and 
collaborate with each other to carry out attacks (Klerks, 2001; Krebs, 2001), 
network analysis methodology can help discover valuable knowledge about 
terrorist organizations by studying the structural properties of the networks 
(Xu and Chen, Forthcoming). We have employed techniques and methods 
68 INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY INFORMATICS 
from social network analysis (SNA) and web mining to address the problem 
of structural analysis of terrorist networks. 
The objective of this case study is to examine the potential of network 
analysis methodology for terrorist analysis. By comparing our findings with 
experts' input we would be able to ascertain whether automatic analysis of 
structural properties of a terrorist network would generate valuable 
knowledge that is consistent with expert knowledge. In this study, we focus 
on the structural properties of a set of Islamic terrorist networks including 
Osama bin Laden's Al-Qaeda. A recently published book (Sageman, 2004) 
documents the history and evolution of these terrorist organizations, which 
are called Global Salafi Jihad (GSJ) in this book. The author of this book is a 
social psychologist and used to be a Foreign Service officer. During the 
Afghan-Soviet war from 1986 to 1989, he dealt with Islamic 
Fundamentalists on a daily basis and acquired a substantial amount of 
expertise in terrorism and terrorist organizations. 
Based on various open sources such as news articles and court 
transcripts, the author collected data about 364 terrorists in the GSJ network 
regarding their background, religious beliefs, social relations, and terrorist 
attacks they participated in. There are three types of social relations among 
these terrorists: personal links (e.g., acquaintance, friendship, and kinship), 
operational links (e.g., collaborators in the same attack), and relations 
formed after attacks (Sageman, 2004). The author identified within this 
network four major terrorist groups based on their geographical locations: 
Central Staff, Core Arab, Maghreb Arab, and Southeast Asian. Each group 
has its own leaders. For example, Osama bin Laden is the leader of the Core 
Staff group, which connects to the other three groups through several 
lieutenants. 
We analyzed the GSJ network based on the social relation data contained 
in a spreadsheet provided by the author. Using the SNA visualization 
approach we depicted the GSJ network graphically as shown in Figure 5-5. 
Centrality analysis. Considering all three types of social relations, we 
found that the four group leaders were among the top 11 most popular 
members, where the popularity was represented by degree measure. For 
example, Osama bin Laden had 72 links to other terrorists and ranked the 
second in degree. Although he was not a leader, Hambali had the highest 
degree score and played an important role in connecting different 
terrorist groups (see Figure 5-5a). Moreover, the lieutenants tended to 
have high scores in betweenness and served as gatekeepers between 
groups. The analysis implies that centrality measures could be useful for 
identifying important members in a terrorist network. 
Intelligence and Warning 69 
Subgroup analysis. The four terrorist groups are shown in Figure 5-5b, 
based on the author's input. To find out whether these geographical- 
based groups were also cohesive groups in structure, we calculated the 
cohesion score (Wasserman and Faust, 1994) of each group. We found 
that all these groups had high cohesion scores. The Southeast Asian 
group scored the highest in cohesion. This may suggest that members in 
this group tended to be more closely related to members in their own 
group than to members from other groups. According to the author, the 
Southeast Asian group was quite different from the other three groups in 
terms of their religious beliefs and missions. 
Network structure analysis. According to the author, these groups had 
different structures: the Southeast Asian group's structure was 
hierarchical, in which members at higher levels lead lower-level 
members, while the other three groups were scale-free networks (Albert 
and Barabasi, 2002). However, we found that the four groups were 
similar in their degree distribution, which was a power-law distribution 
with a long tail for large values of degree. This implies that all four 
networks were scale-free networks in which a few important members 
(nodes with high degree scores) dominated the network and new 
members tend to join a network through these dominating members. This 
finding has an important policy implication, that is, disruptive strategies 
should potentially be focused on central members in a terrorist network. 
Link path analysis. Comparing the personal network representation 
(Figure 5-5b) and the operational network representation (Figure 5-5c), 
we found that some important members did not have direct personal links 
to an attack prior to the execution of the attack. For example, Osama bin 
Laden, KSM, and Hambali had no direct personal links to terrorists in the 
9/11 attack clique. We performed link path analysis to find out the 
shortest paths of personal links that lead to 911 1 terrorists. One of our 
hypotheses was that Osama bin Laden connected to the 9/11 clique 
through a four-hop path: bin Laden - Nashiri - ZaMihd - Mihdhar - 
Shibh (the highlighted path in Figure 5-5b). Although this hypothesis 
turned out to be wrong based on the author's feedback (other information 
was needed to establish the link), the analysis showed the potential of 
using link path analysis to generate hypotheses about the motives and 
planning processes of terrorist attacks.

5.5 Future Directions 
Deception detection is one of the unique problems facing law 
enforcement and intelligence applications. Criminals and terrorists often try 
to hide or disguise their identities via various means. Biometric (e.g., 
fingerprints and DNA) techniques and behavioral or psychological 
interrogations have been widely adopted in law enforcement and intelligence 
communities. With the abundance of criminal identity information available 
in law enforcement and intelligence databases and the ability of advanced 
algorithms for "fuzzy" queries and entity matching, we believe data mining 
guided deception detection research shows tremendous potential. 
We also believe that web-based open source "terrorism informatics" 
research is critically needed for terrorism research and intelligence analysis 
purposes. There is a pressing need for traditional terrorism researchers and 
Intelligence and Warning 73 
analysts to leverage the new advances in web retrieval, mining, analysis, and 
visualization. By combining the domain expertise and methodology well 
established in terrorism research with new information technologies, we 
believe the new science of terrorism informatics would emerge and 
contribute to the systematic study and understanding of the global terrorism 
phenomena. 
5.6 Questions for Discussion 
1. What are other deception detection applications in the law enforcement 
or intelligence community? How can relevant datasets be obtained? 
2. What are some ways to identify terrorism researchers? What are the 
major terrorism research conferences and publications? What are the 
major terrorism research centers? 
3. What are some ways to collaborate with the intelligence community for 
non-security clearance level research? What are some of the rich open 
sources for technical IS1 research? 
4. What are some ways to develop and advance multilingual and 
multimedia research in ISI? What are the technical foundations and 
promising approaches?

BORDER AND TRANSPORTATION 
SECURITY 
Chapter Overview 
Terrorists enter a targeted country through an air, land, or sea port of entry. 
Criminals in narcotics rings travel across borders to purchase, carry, 
distribute, and sell drugs. Creating a "smart border" can greatly improve the 
governnlent's counter-terrorism and crime-fighting capabilities, where 
information from borders, customs, departments of transportation, and local 
law enforcement are integrated and analyzed to help locate terrorists or 
criminals. We present our "BorderSafe9' project for cross-jurisdictional 
information sharing and criminal network analysis as an example for 
creating a smart and safe border. 
Border and Transportation Security 77 
6.1 Case Study 5: Enhancing "BorderSafeV Information 
Sharing 
The Bordersafe project is a collaborative research effort involving the 
University of Arizona's Artificial Intelligence Lab, law enforcement 
agencies, including the Tucson Police Department (TPD), Pima County 
Sheriffs Department (PCSD), and Tucson Customs and Border Protection 
(CBP), as well as San Diego ARJIS (Automated Regional Justice 
Information Systems, a regional consortium of 50+ public safety agencies), 
San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC), and the Corporation for National 
Research Initiative (CNRI). 
In this study our objective was to share and analyze structured, 
authoritative data from TPD, PCSD, and a limited dataset from CBP 
containing license plate data of border crossing vehicles. Tables 6-1 and 6-2 
present the statistics of the three datasets. TPD's and PCSD's jurisdictions 
represent a shared community of citizens in Tucson and southern Arizona. 
They also share intertwined communities of criminals in these areas. We 
found a substantial amount of data overlap among these datasets. Around 7% 
of vehicles involved in gang-related, violent, and narcotics crimes were 
registered outside of Arizona. More than 483,000 people appeared in both 
the TPD and PCSD datasets. That represented 36% of the TPD records and 
37% of the PCSD records. These statistics strongly suggest that sharing 
information across jurisdictions could help catch criminals.

then mapped or transformed to allow shared query processing. In our 
datasets, the establishment of automated transformation procedures for 
putting legacy PCSD and TPD records into COPLINK format resolved most 
structural and semantic difference issues. 
At the instance level, each dataset had a unique key assigncd to each 
person or vehicle, but these unique keys did not match across datasets. To 
address this problem, vehicles were then matched between datascts based on 
their license plate numbers.

For people match, we based the matching on input from domain experts 
and assumed that all records with the same first name, last name, and DOB 
represented the same person. These heuristics were not pcrfcct; a few 
Border and Transportation Security 79 
incorrect matches resulted and certainly many correct matches might have 
been missed. 
We generated and visualized several criminal networks based on 
integrated data. We extracted associations between a set of criminals and 
vehicles from crime incident records. A link was created when two or more 
criminals or vehicles were listed in the same incident record. In network 
visualization we differentiated entity types by shape, key attributes by node 
color, level of activeness (measured by number of crimes committed) as 
node size, data source by link color, and some details in link text or roll-over 
tool tips. Figure 6-1 shows a network connecting a known narcotics dealer 
to a border crossing license plate. 
A qualitative field study was conducted to assess the potential of our data 
integration approach. We received positive feedback regarding the value of 
integrated data. The crime analysts who participated in the evaluation study 
expressed confidence that including border crossing information into their 
investigations would promptly result in arrests and convictions. One analyst 
commented: "I had no idea that these types of complex networks involving 
Mexican plates even existed in the Tucson area. That information could 
subsequently be used to focus and direct law enforcement resources and 
investigations." 
6.2 Case Study 6: Topological Analysis of Cross- 
Jurisdictional Criminal Networks 
A criminal activity network (CAN) is a network of interconnected 
criminals, vehicles, and locations based on law enforcement records. The 
networks can be augmented with data from sources like transportation 
systems and motor vehicle division data. These networks allow us to analyze 
and visualize information that is helpful for identifying suspicious vehicles 
and people at the border or around critical infrastructures. Criminal activity 
networks can contain information from multiple sources and be used to 
identify relationships between people and vehicles that are unknown to a 
single jurisdiction (Chen et al., 2004). As a result, cross-jurisdictional 
information sharing and triangulation can help generate better investigative 
leads and strengthen legal cases against criminals. 
Criminal activity networks can be large and complex (particularly in a 
cross-jurisdictional environment) and can be better analyzed if we study 
their topological properties. Topological properties describe the network as a 
whole and help us better understand its governing mechanisms. Topological 
properties can also be used to quantify the advantages of data sharing to law 
enforcement and transportation security agencies/personnel. In addition, 
understanding the properties of CANS can help design better analysis tools 
80 INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY INFOMA TICS 
to assist in identifying potentially dangerous vehicles and people. In this 
study, we examine the topological properties of, and explore important 
research questions related to, cross-jurisdictional criminal activity networks. 
Complex networks of individuals and other entities have been 
traditionally studied under the random graph theory. However, later studies 
suggested that real-world complex networks may not be random but may be 
governed by certain organizing principles (Albert & Barabasi, 2002). This 
prompted the study of real-world networks. These studies have explored the 
topology, evolution and growth, robustness and attack tolerance, and other 
properties of networks. 
The datasets used in this study are available to us through the DHS- 
funded Bordersafe project. To study criminal activity networks we used 
police incident reports from the Tucson Police Department (TPD) and the 
Pima County Sheriffs Department (PCSD) from 1990 - 2002. 
This testbed was used to extract narcotics networks that consisted of 
vehicles and individuals as nodes and police incidents as edges between 
them. Individuals were included as nodes in the network if they were 
wanted, suspected, arrested, or had a warrant for arrest in a narcotics crime. 
Vehicles were included as nodes in the network if they had been involved 
with a suspect in a narcotics crime. Two nodes were connected by an edge if 
they were in the same incident involving a narcotics or narcotics-related 
crime. Table 6-3 presents the basic statistics of the narcotics networks 
extracted from TPD and PCSD's records. 
A giant component containing the majority of the nodes emerges from 
both networks. This is not uncommon; other social and affiliation networks 
that have been studied before exhibit this structure. The giant component, in 
this case, is a large group of individuals linked by narcotics crimes. In 
addition, we find that the second largest component is significantly smaller, 
suggesting that other much smaller groups of people exist in both 
jurisdictions.

The small-world and scale-free properties of these and other networks 
shown later are studied by using the giant component. The small-world 
properties of both networks are shown in Table 6-4. 
The narcotics networks in both jurisdictions can be classified as small- 
world networks since their clustering coefficients are much higher than 
comparable random graphs, and they have a small average shortest path 
length (L) relative to their size. The high clustering coefficient suggests that 
criminals show a tendency to form circles of associates who partner in 
crimes. According to domain experts this is not unusual in narcotics 
networks, where individuals tend to have circles of trust that include friends 
and family members. This property is advantageous to law enforcement 
because it helps them form strong conspiracy cases against other members of 
the group. A small L implies a faster flow of information (e.g., news of 
police raids) and goods (e.g., drugs) in the network. However, short paths 
could be advantageous for law enforcement too. Investigators search for 
associations among criminals to form a case against them. They suggest that 
shorter association paths between criminals generate better and higher 
quality investigative leads. Table 6-5 presents the scale-free properties of 
both networks.

The narcotics networks have degree distributions that follow the 
truncated power law, which classifies them as scale-free networks. This 
implies that a large number of nodes have low degrees as shown by the slow 
rate of decay (exponents of 0.85 - 1.3) at low values of k. This is not 
unexpected since high degrees attract more attention from law enforcement 
authorities, so having fewer associates is beneficial. However, it is worth 
pointing out that the degree of a node in these narcotics networks is also 
restricted by the fact that we are considering only narcotics-related crimes 
(to extract 'pure' narcotics networks). If other common crimes like traffic

citations are included, then degrees are likely to be greater. Thus, the 
exponent (y) value can be affected by the methods used for network 
extraction. The truncated power law distribution fits both curves better ( R ~  = 
93%) than the power law distribution ( R ~  = 85%, 87%). This suggests that as 
the degree (k) increases, the probability of having k links (p(k)) decreases. 
This might indicate a cost or trust constraint to growth. 
Table 6-6 shows the topological properties of the TPD narcotics network 
when it is augmented with associations found in PCSD data. No additional 
individuals from PCSD data were added. 
Table 6-6. Topological statistics on adding associations (found in PCSD data) between the 
individuals in the TPD narcotics network. Values in parenthesis are for the original TPD 
network. 
In Table 6-6, we see that the size of the giant component in the TPD 
narcotics network increases. Nodes that were previously thought to be 
disconnected from the main network got connected. Since we added only 
associations, it is clear that PCSD data contained associations between 
individuals in TPD data that TPD was not aware of. The increase in the 
number of edges shows that previously unknown associations between 
existing and new nodes were added. From a total of 28,684 new 
relationships added, 6,300 (statistic not in Table 6-6) were between existing 
criminals in the TPD narcotics network. These new associations between 
existing people help form a stronger case against criminals. The increase in 
the number of nodes and associations is a convincing example of the 
advantage of sharing data between jurisdictions. 
The topological properties have important implications for law 
enforcement and hence transportation security. We found that a single 
jurisdiction may contain incomplete information on criminals and cross- 
jurisdictional data provides an increased number of high-quality 
investigative leads. The inclusion of vehicular data in criminal activity 
networks had clear advantages. Vehicles provided new investigative leads 
Border and Transportation Security 83 
that can be used to target individuals and vehicles that might pose a threat to 
the security of the border and transportation infrastructure. 
6.3 Future Directions 
Many federal agencies are directly involved in protecting the safety of 
the U.S. borders (e.g., Immigration, Customs and Border Protection, 
Transportation Security Agency, Border Patrols, etc). Although most of 
these previously disparate agencies are consolidated under the Department 
of Homeland Security, significant cultural, organizational, and information 
technology barriers exist. In addition, other federal agencies, such as the FBI 
and the CIA, and local jurisdictions also hold critical information about 
selected border crossers and vehicles that may be of relevance. With the 
passage of the USA PATRIOT Act and the continuous re-structuring within 
DHS, we hope to see a more cooperative relationship among these agencies 
for information sharing. 
However, information sharing without careful data mining research or 
civil liberties considerations will only cause information overload and 
potential misuse. Unreasonable border protection and immigration policy 
could also severely affect international trading. Much policy and technical 
research is needed for border and transportation security in this era of 
increasing globalization. 
6.4 Questions for Discussion 
1. How can information technology research and civil liberties 
considerations be balanced in the context of border and transportation 
security? 
2. What are some ways to collaborate with various DHS agencies in border 
and transportation security research? What are the relevant DHS funding 
programs? 
3. What are some of the other relevant technologies and techniques for 
border and transportation security research? 
Chapter 7 
DOMESTIC COUNTER-TERRORISM 
Chapter Overview 
As terrorists may be involved in local crimes, state and local law 
enforcement agencies are contributing to national security by investigating 
and prosecuting crimes. Terrorism, like gangs and narcotics trafficking, is 
treated as a type of organized crime in which multiple offenders cooperate to 
carry out offenses. Information technologies that help find cooperative 
relationships between criminals and their interactive patterns would also be 
helpful in analyzing terrorism. Through three case studies in this section, we 
show how criminal association information can be extracted from large 
volunles of data and how structural patterns in criminal or terrorist 
organizations can be discovered. 
Domestic Counter-terrorism 8 7 
7.1 Case Study 7: COPLINK Detect 
Crime analysts and detectives search for criminal associations to develop 
investigative leads. However, because association information is not directly 
available in most existing law enforcement and intelligence databases and 
manual searching is extremely time-consuming, automatic identification of 
relationships among criminal entities may significantly speed up crime 
investigations. COPLINK Detect is a system that automatically extracts 
criminal element relationships from large volumes of crime incident data 
(Hauck et al., 2002). 
Our data were structured crime incident records stored in TPD databases. 
TPD's current record management system (RMS) consists of more than 1.5 
million crime incident records that contain details from criminal events 
spanning the period from 1986 to 2004. Although investigators can access 
the RMS to tie together information, they must manually search the RMS for 
connections or existing relationships. 
We used the concept space approach (Chen and Lynch, 1992) to identify 
relationships between entities of interest. Concept space analysis is a type of 
co-occurrence analysis used in information retrieval. The resulting network- 
like concept space holds all possible associations between terms, which 
means that the system retains and ranks every existing link between every 
pair of concepts. In COPLINK Detect, detailed incident records served as 
the underlying space, while concepts derive from the meaningful terms that 
occur in each incident. Concept space analysis easily identifies relevant 
terms and their degree of relationship to the search term. The system output 
includes relevant terms ranked in the order of their degree of association, 
thereby distinguishing the most relevant terms from inconsequential terms. 
From a crime investigation standpoint, concept space analysis can help 
investigators link known entities to other related entities that might contain 
useful information for further investigation, such as people and vehicles 
related to a given suspect. It is considered an example of entity association 
mining (Lin and Brown, 2003). 
Information related to a suspect can direct an investigation to expand in 
the right direction, but revealing relationships among data in one particular 
incident might fail to capture those relationships from the entire database. In 
effect, investigators need to review all incident reports related to a suspect, 
which can be tedious work. The COPLINK Detect system introduces 
concept space as an alternative method that captures the relationships 
between four types of entities (person, organization, location, and vehicle) in 
the entire database. COPLINK Detect also offers an easy-to-use user inter- 
face and allows searching for relationships among the four types of entities.

Figure 7-1 presents the COPLINK Detect interface showing sample 
search results of vehicles, relations, and crime case details (Hauck et al., 
2002). 
We conducted user studies to evaluate the performance and usefulness of 
COPLINK Detect. Twelve crime analysts and detectives participated in the 
field study during a four-week period. Three major areas were identified 
where COPLINK Detect provided improved support for crime investigation: 
Link analysis. Participants indicated that COPLINK Detect served as a 
powerful tool for acquiring criminal association information. They cited 
its value in helping determine the presence or absence of links between 
people, places, vehicles, and other entity types in investigating a crime. 
Interface design. In general, users reported that they found the COPLINK 
Detect interface easy to use. Officers noted that the graphical user 
interface and use of color to distinguish different entity types provided a 
more intuitive visualization than traditional text-based record 
management systems. 
Operating eflciency. In a direct comparison of 15 searches, using 
COPLINK Detect required an average of 30 minutes less per search than 
did a benchmark record management system (20 minutes vs. 50 minutes).

7.2 Case Study 8: Criminal Network Mining 
Because organized crimes are carried out by networked offenders, 
investigation of organized crimes naturally depends on network analysis 
approaches. Grounded on social network analysis (SNA) methodology, our 
criminal network structure mining research aims to help intelligence and 
security agencies extract valuable knowledge regarding criminal or terrorist 
organizations by identifying the central members, subgroups, and network 
structure (Xu and Chen, Forthcoming). 
Two datasets from TPD were used in the study. (1) A gang network: the 
list of gang members consisted of 16 offenders who had been under 
investigation in the first quarter of 2002. These gang members had been 
involved in 72 crime incidents of various types (e.g., theft, burglary, 
aggravated assault, drug offense, etc.) since 1985. We used the concept 
space approach and generated links between criminals who had committed 
crimes together, resulting in a network of 164 members. (2) A narcotics 
network: the list for the narcotics network consisted of 71 criminal names. A 
sergeant from the Gang Unit had been studying the activities of these 
criminals since 1995. Because most of them had committed crimes related to 
methamphetamines, the sergeant called this network the "Meth World." 
These offenders had been involved in 1,206 incidents since 1983. A network 
of 744 members was generated. 
We employed SNA approaches to extract structural patterns in our 
criminal networks. 
Network Partition. We employed hierarchical clustering, namely the 
complete-link algorithm, to partition a network into subgroups based on 
relational strength. Clusters obtained represent subgroups. To employ the 
algorithm, we first transformed co-occurrence weights generated in the 
previous phrase into distancesldissimilarities. The distance between two 
clusters was defined as the distance between the pair of nodes drawn 
from each cluster that was farthest apart. The algorithm worked by 
merging the two nearest clusters into one cluster at each step and 
eventually formed a cluster hierarchy. The resulting cluster hierarchy 
specified groupings of network members at different granularity levels. 
At lower levels of the hierarchy, clusters (subgroups) tended to be 
smaller and group members were more closely related. At higher levels 
of the hierarchy, subgroups are large and group members might be 
loosely related. 
Centrality Measures. We used all three centrality measures to identify 
central members in a given subgroup. The degree of a node could be 
obtained by counting the total number of links it had to all the other 
Domestic Counter-terrorism 91 
group members. A node's score of betweenness and closeness required 
the computation of shortest paths (geodesics) using Dijkstra's algorithm 
(1959). 
Blockmodeling. At a given level of a cluster hierarchy, we compared 
between-group link densities with the network's overall link density to 
determine the presence or absence of between-group relationships. 
Visualization. To map a criminal network onto a two-dimensional 
display, we employed Multi-Dimensional Scaling (MDS) to generate x-y 
coordinates for each member in a network. We chose Torgerson's 
classical MDS algorithm (Torgerson, 1952) since distances transformed 
from co-occurrence weights were quantitative data. 
A graphical user interface was provided to visualize criminal networks. 
Figure 7-2 shows the screenshot of our prototype system. In this example, 
each node was labeled with the name of the criminal it represented. Criminal 
names were scrubbed for data confidentiality. A straight line connecting two 
nodes indicated that two corresponding criminals committed crimes together 
and thus were related. To find subgroups and interaction patterns between 
groups, a user could adjust the "level of abstraction" slider at the bottom of 
the panel. A high level of abstraction corresponded with a high distance 
level in the cluster hierarchy. Group members' rankings in centrality are 
listed in a table. 
We conducted a qualitative study recently to evaluate the prototype 
system. We presented the two testing networks to domain experts at TPD 
and received encouraging feedback: 
Subgroups detected were mostly correct. Our domain experts checked 
and validated the members in each group. These groups had different 
characteristics with different specialties or crime preferences. We also 
found that although relationships in our networks were extracted based 
on crime incidents, they reflected true relationships between criminals 
such as friendship, kinship, and even conflicts. 
Centrality measures provided ways of identiBing key members in a 
network. According to our domain experts, betweenness was a reliable 
measure to identify gatekeepers between subgroups. However, degree 
sometimes identified wrong leaders because the criminals with the most 
connections to others may not always be the leaders. Leaders may be 
smart enough to hide behind other criminals to avoid police contact.

Interaction patterns identz3ed could help reveal relationships that 
previously had been overlooked. Our system could generate the "big 
picture" for a complex network. As a result some relationships between 
criminal groups that were overlooked before could become easier to 
identify. 
Saving investigation time. Our domain experts obtained knowledge about 
the gang and narcotics organizations during several years of work. Using 
information gathered from a large number of arrests and interviews, they 
built the networks incrementally by linking new criminals to known 
gangs in the network and then studying the organization of these 
networks. Because there was no structural analysis tool available, they 
did all this work by hand. With the help of our system, they expected 
substantial time could be saved in network creation and structural 
analysis. 
Domestic Counter-terrorism 95 
Saving training time for new investigators. New investigators who did 
not have sufficient knowledge of criminal organizations and individuals 
could use the system to grasp the essence of the network and crime 
history quickly. They would not have to spend a significant amount of 
time studying hundreds of incident reports. 
Helping prove guilt of criminals in court. The relationships discovered 
between individual criminals and criminal groups would be helpfbl for 
proving guilt when presented at court for prosecution. 
7.3 Case Study 9: Domestic Extremist Groups on the Web 
Although not as well-known as some of the international terrorist 
organizations, the extremist and hate groups within the United States also 
pose a significant threat to our national security. Recently, these groups have 
been intensively utilizing the Internet to advance their causes. Thus, to 
understand how the domestic extremist and hate groups develop their web 
presence is very important in addressing domestic terrorism threats. This 
study proposes the development of systematic methodologies to capture 
domestic extremist and hate groups' web site data and support subsequent 
analyses. In this study, we aim to answer the following research questions: 
What are the most appropriate techniques for collecting high-quality web 
pages of domestic extremist and hate groups? 
What are the systematic procedures for analyzing and visualizing the 
content of these individual web sites? 
We propose a sequence of semi-automated methods to study domestic 
extremist and hate group content on the web. First, we employ a semi- 
automatic procedure to harvest and construct a high-quality domestic 
terrorist web site collection. We then perform hyperlink analysis based on a 
clustering algorithm to reveal the relationships between these groups. Lastly, 
we conduct an attribute-based content analysis to determine how these 
groups use the web for their purposes. Because the procedure adopted in this 
study is similar to that reported in Case Study 3, Jihad on the Web, we only 
summarize selected interesting results below. 
Collection Building: We manually extracted a set of URLs from relevant 
literature. In particular, the web sites of the "Southern Poverty Law 
Center" (SPLC, www.splcenter.org) and the Anti-Defamation League 
(ADL, www.adl.org) are authoritative sources for identifying domestic 
extremists and hate groups. A total of 266 seed URLs were identified in 
SPLC and the ADL web sites as well as in the Google directory. A 
96 INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY INFORMA TICS 
backlink expansion of this initial set was performed and the count 
increased to 386 URLs. The resulting set of URLs is validated by an 
expert. A total of 97 URLs were deemed relevant. We then spidered and 
downloaded all of the web documents within the identified web sites. As 
a result, our final collection contained about 400,000 documents. 
Hyperlink Analysis: Using the MDS algorithm (Torgerson, 1952), we 
visualize the hidden hyperlinked communities among 35 web sites 
randomly retrieved from our collection. Several communities are 
identified in the network shown in Figure 7-3. The top-left side of the 
network shows the "Neo-Confederate" cluster, which mainly consists of 
the web sites of new confederate organizations in the Southern states. 
They espouse a separatist ideology, promoting the establishment of an 
independent state in the south. In addition, they share elements of white 
supremacy ideas with other non-neo-confederate racist organizations 
such as the KKK. A cluster of web sites of white supremacists occupies 
the top-right corner of the network, including: Stormfront, White Aryan 
Resistance, etc. Christian Identity, Militia, and Eco-Terrorism clusters 
were also identified. 
Content Analysis: We asked our domain experts to review each web site 
in our collection and record the presence of low-level attributes based on 
an eight-attribute coding scheme: Sharing Ideology, Propaganda 
(Insiders), Recruitment and Training, Command and Control, Virtual 
Community, Propaganda (Outsiders), Fundraising, and Communications. 
For instance, the web page of "Nation of Islam" contains recordings of 
the organization's leaders (for their followers). The presence of these 
recordings contributes to the web site's content richness and is coded 
under the "Propaganda (Insiders)" attribute. Our web coding scheme is 
similar in nature to the one developed by Demchak et al. (2000) for 
coding government web site characteristics.

The manual coding of the attributes in a web site takes about 45 minutes. 
After completing coding for the web sites in our collection, we compared the 
content of each of the six domestic extremist and hate groups as shown in 
Figure 7-4. "Sharing Ideology" is the attribute with the highest frequency of 
occurrence in these web sites. It encapsulates all communication media 
devoted to portraying the goals of the terrorist group, defining its general 
policies, and presenting the foundational ideology. In addition, "Propaganda 
(Insiders)" and "Recruitment and Training" are widely used by all groups on 
their web sites. 
Another interesting observation is the low presence of "Propaganda 
(Outsiders)," with the exception of Eco-terrorisdAnima1 Rights groups, 
which are considered to have a much wider audience than the racist groups, 
who have a more targeted audience. Much research is still needed for 
systematic understanding of how domestic extremist and hate groups use the 
web to promote their causes. 
7.4 Case Study 10: Topological Analysis of Dark 
Networks 
Large-scale networks such as scientific collaboration networks, the 
World Wide Web, the Internet, electric power grids, food webs, and 
metabolic networks are surprisingly similar in topology (e.g., power-law 
degree distribution), leading to a conjecture that complex systems are 
governed by the same self-organizing principle (Albert & Barabasi, 2002). 
Although the topological properties of these networks have been discovered, 
the structures of dark (covert, illegal) networks are largely unknown due to 
the difficulty of collecting and accessing reliable data (Krebs, 2001). Do 
dark networks share the same topological properties with other types of 
networks? Do they follow the same organizing principle? How do they 
achieve efficiency under constant surveillance and threat from authorities? 
We report in this study the topological properties of several covert criminal- 
or terrorist-related networks. We hope not only to contribute to general 
knowledge of the topological properties of complex systems in a hostile 
environment but also to provide authorities with insights regarding 
disruptive strategies. 
Three models have been employed to characterize complex networks: 
random graph model, small-world model, and scale-free model (Albert & 
Barabasi, 2002). Most complex systems are not random but are governed by 
certain organizing principles encoded in the topology of the networks. A 
small-world network has a significantly larger clustering coefficient than its 
random model counterpart while maintaining a relatively small average path 
Domestic Counter-terrorism 99 
length. The large clustering coefficient indicates that there is a high tendency 
for nodes to form communities and groups. Scale-free networks, on the other 
hand, are characterized by the power-law degree distribution, meaning that 
while a large number of nodes in the network have just a few links, a small 
fraction of the nodes have a large number of links. It is believed that scale- 
free networks evolve following the self-organizing principle, where growth 
and preferential attachment play a key role for the emergence of the power- 
law degree distribution. 
We studied the topology of four covert networks: the Global Salafi Jihad 
(GSJ) terrorist network (Sageman, 2004), a narcotics trafficking criminal 
network (Xu & Chen, 2003; Xu & Chen, Forthcoming) whose members 
mainly deal with methamphetamines, a gang criminal network, and a 
terrorist web site network (Chen et al., 2004). The 366-member GSJ network 
was constructed based entirely on open source data but all nodes and links 
were examined and carefully validated by a domain expert. The "Meth 
World" consists of 1,349 criminals who were involved in methamphetamine- 
related crimes in Tucson, Arizona, between 1985 and 2002. The gang 
network consists of 3,917 criminals who were involved in gang-related 
crimes in Tucson between 1985 and 2002. In the two criminal networks, two 
members are connected if they committed at least one crime together. Based 
on reliable governmental sources, we also identified 104 web sites created 
by four major international terrorist groups. Hyperlinks were used as 
between-site relations. 
Each network contains many small components and a single giant 
component (see Table 7-1). We focused only on the giant component in 
these networks and performed topology analysis and robustness analysis. We 
found that all these networks are small worlds (see Table 7-2). The average 
path lengths and diameters of these networks are small with respect to their 
network sizes. Thus, a terrorist or criminal can connect with any other 
member in a network through just a few mediators. In addition, these 
networks are quite sparse with very low link density. These two properties 
have important implications to the efficiency of transmission of goods and 
information within the networks. Because the risk of being detected by 
authorities increases as more people are involved, the small path length and 
link sparseness can help lower risks and enhance efficiency. In addition, we 
calculated the path length of a node to a central node, a measure which is 
called "Erdos number" in the network of mathematicians. This measure is 
also related to the closeness centrality, defined as the total path length from a 
specific node to all other nodes in a network. We found that members in the 
criminal and terrorist networks are extremely close to their leaders. The 
terrorists in the GSJ network are on average only 2.5 steps away from bin 
Laden, meaning that bin Laden's command can reach an arbitrary member 
I00 INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY INFORMATICS 
through only two mediators. Similarly, the average path length to the leader 
in the Meth World is only 3.9. Such a short chain of command means 
communication efficiency. However, special attention should be paid to the 
Dark Web. Despite its small size (go), the average path length is 4.70, larger 
than that (4.20) of the GSJ network, which has almost 9 times more nodes. 
Since hyperlinks help visitors navigate between web pages, and because 
terrorist web sites are often used for soliciting new members and donations, 
the relatively long path length may be due to the reluctance of terrorist 
groups to share potential resources with other terrorist groups. 
The other small-world topology, high clustering coefficient, is also 
present in these dark networks. The clustering coefficients of these four 
networks are significantly higher than those of random graph counterparts. 
Previous studies have also shown the evidence of groups and teams in these 
networks. In these groups and teams, members tend to have denser and 
stronger relations with one another. The communication between group 
members becomes more efficient, making a crime or an attack easier to plan, 
organize, and execute. 
In addition, these dark networks are scale-free systems. The three human 
networks have an exponentially truncated power-law degree distribution (see 
Table 7-1 and Figure 7-5). Different from other types of networks whose 
exponents usually are between 2.0 and 3.0, the exponents of dark networks 
are fairly small. The degree distribution decays much more slowly for small 
degrees than for that of other types of networks, indicating a higher 
frequency for small degrees. 
Table 7-1. The statistics and parameters in the exponentially truncated power-law degree 
distribution of the dark networks. 
At the same time, the exponential cutoff implies that the distribution for 
large degrees decays faster than is expected for a power-law distribution, 
preventing the emergence of large hubs which have many links. 
Domestic Counter-terrorism 101 
Two possible reasons have been suggested that may attenuate the effect 
of growth and preferential attachment: (a) the aging effect: as time 
progresses some older nodes may stop receiving new links, and (b) the cost 
effect: as maintaining links induces costs (Hurnmon, 2000), there is a 
constraint on the maximum number of links a node can have. We believe 
that the aging effect does exist in the dark networks. In the Meth World, for 
example, some criminals who were present in the network several years ago 
may have become inactive due to arrest or death, and thus could not receive 
new links even though they are still included in the network. Moreover, the 
cost of links takes the form of risks. Under constant threat from authorities, 
criminals or terrorists may avoid attaching to too many people, limiting the 
effects of preferential attachment.

Evidence has shown that hubs in criminal networks may not be the real 
leaders. Another possible constraint on preferential attachment is trust 
(Krebs, 2001). This constraint is especially common in the GSJ network 
where the terrorists preferred to attach to those who were their relatives, 
friends, or religious partners.

As terrorists may be involved in local crimes and conduct their acts in 
local jurisdictions, state and local law enforcement agencies are crucial in 
fighting terrorism. International terrorists may also leverage the covert gang, 
narcotic, and people smuggling networks to evade law enforcement 
investigation and capture. The tragic event of the Oklahoma City bombing 
shows the continuous threat of domestic extremist and terrorist groups. 
Information technologies can help find relationships between criminals and 
(domestic and international) terrorists. 
We believe network mining, network visualization, and network 
topological analysis techniques are invaluable for understanding criminal 
and terrorist networks. Instead of studying single criminal entities or pairs of 
entities, we need to study criminals and terrorists using a network 
perspective. However, we also see a pressing need to develop new theories 
and principles based on the unique characteristics of the "dark networks" - 
covertness effect, law enforcement disruption effect, criminal aging effect, 
religious influence effect, etc. Criminology, criminal psychology, public 
policy, and terrorism research can potentially contribute to the study of dark 
networks.

PROTECTING CRITICAL 
INFRASTRUCTURE AND KEY ASSETS 
Chapter Overview 
The Internet is a critical infrastructure and asset in the information age. 
However, cyber criminals have been using various web-based channels (e.g., 
email, web sites, Internet newsgroups, and Internet chat rooms) to distribute 
illegal materials. One common characteristic of these channels is anonymity. 
Compared with conventional crimes, cybercrime conducted through such 
anonymous channels imposes unique challenges for researchers and law 
enforcement and intelligence agencies in criminal identity tracing. Law 
enforcement and intelligence agencies have an urgent need for approaches 
that automate criminal and terrorist identity tracing in cyberspace. Three 
case studies in this chapter demonstrate the potential of using multilingual 
authorship analysis with carefully selected writing style feature sets and 
effective classification techniques for identity tracing in cyberspace. 
Protecting Critical Infrastructure and Key Assets 107 
8.1 Case Study 11: Identity Tracing in Cyberspace 
With the rapid proliferation of Internet technologies and applications, 
cybercrime has become a major concern for the law enforcement 
community. Cyber criminals have been distributing messages on the Internet 
to conduct illegal activities. The anonymous nature of online message 
distribution has made criminal identity tracing a critical problem in 
cybercrime investigation. We developed a framework for authorship 
identification of online messages to address the identity tracing problem. In 
this framework, three types of writing style features are extracted and 
inductive learning algorithms are used to build feature-based classification 
models to identify authorship of online messages. 
Data used in this study were from open sources. Three datasets, two in 
English and one in Chinese, were collected. One of the English datasets 
consisted of 153 USENET newsgroup illegal sales of pirate CDs and 
software messages. We manually identified the nine most active users 
(represented by a unique ID and email address) who frequently posted 
messages in these newsgroups. The Chinese dataset contained 70 Bulletin 
Board System (BBS) illegal CD and software for-sale messages downloaded 
from a popular Chinese BBS. 
The two key techniques used in this study were feature selection and 
classification. The objective was to classify text messages into different 
classes with each class representing one author. Based on the review of 
previous studies on text and email authorship analysis, along with the 
specific characteristics of the messages in our datasets, we selected a large 
number of features that were potentially useful for identifying message 
authors. Three types of features were used: style markers (content-free 
features such as frequency of function word, total number of punctuations, 
average sentence length, etc.), structural features (such as use of a greeting 
statement, use of farewell statement, etc.), and content-spec@ features 
(such as frequency of keywords, special character of content, etc.). Many 
additional metrics were used in our study as described in Figures 8-1, 8-2, 
and 8-3. 
For classification analysis, three popular classifiers were selected, 
including the C4.5 decision tree algorithm (Quinlan, 1986), backpropagation 
neural networks (Lippmann, 1987), and support vector machines (Cristianini 
& Shawe-Taylor, 2000; Hsu & Lin, 2002). Each individual classifier has 
been employed in previous authorship analysis research (Diederich et al., 
2000). In general SVM and neural networks have better performance than 
decision trees (Diederich et al., 2000). However, most previous authorship 
studies were based on newspaper articles such as the Federalist Papers. 
Because online messages are quite different from formal articles in style and 
108 INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY INFORMATICS 
length, we needed to test the performances of these algorithms on our 
datasets. 
Additional style markers in this experiment: 
Total number of words in subject 
Total number of characters in subject (S) 
Total number of upper-case characters in words in subject/S 
Total number of punctuations in subject/S 
Total number of white-space characters in subject/S 
Total number of lines 
Total number of characters 
* We used 122 function words and 48 markers suggested by de Vel (de Vel et al., 
2001). Another 28 of the most common function words from the Oxford English 
Dictionary and seven other markers were also included.

Figure 8-3. Content-specific features (9 features, for newsgroup messages only). 
Three experiments were conducted on the newsgroup dataset with one 
classifier at a time. First, 205 style markers (67 for Chinese BBS dataset) 
were used; nine structural features were added in the second run; and nine 
Protecting Critical Infrastructure and Key Assets 109 
content-specific features were added in the third run. A 30-fold cross- 
validation testing method was used in all experiments. 
We used accuracy, recall, and precision to evaluate the prediction 
performance of the three classifiers. Accuracy represents the overall 
prediction performance of a classifier. For each particular author, we used 
precision and recall to measure the effectiveness of a classifier. The three 
measures are defined in equations (1)-(3). 
Accuracy = Number of messages whose author was correctly identified (1) 
Total number of messages 
Number of messages correctly assigned to the author Recall = (2) 
Total number of messages written by the author 
Number of messages correctly assigned to the author 
Precision = 
Total number of messages assigned to the author 
We summarize the results as follows: 
SVM and neural networks achieved better performance than the C4.5 
decision tree algorithm. For example, using style markers on the email 
dataset, the C4.5, neural networks, and SVM achieved accuracies of 
74.29%, 8 1.1 1%, and 82.86% respectively. SVM also achieved 
consistently higher accuracies, precision, and recall than the neural 
networks. However, the performance differences between SVM and 
neural networks were relatively small. Our results were generally 
consistent with previous studies, in that neural networks and SVM 
typically had better performance than decision tree algorithms (Diederich 
et al., 2000). 
Using style markers and structural features outperformed using style 
markers only. We achieved significantly higher accuracies for all three 
datasets ('-values were all below 0.05) by adopting the structural 
features. This possibly resulted from an author's consistent writing 
patterns present in the message's structural features. 
Using style markers, structural features, and content-speczjk features did 
not outperform using style markers and structural features. The results 
indicated that using content-specific features as additional features did 
not improve the authorship prediction performance significantly (with p- 
value of 0.3086). We thought this was because authors of illegal 
110 INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY INFOMA TICS 
messages typically delivered diverse contents in their messages and little 
additional information could be derived from the message contents to 
determine the authorship. We also observed that high accuracies were 
obtained using only style markers as input features for the English 
datasets. The accuracies ranged from 71% to 89%. The results indicated 
that style markers alone contain a large amount of information about 
people's online message writing styles and were surprisingly robust in 
predicting the authorship. 
There is a signzjkant drop in prediction performance measures for the 
Chinese BBS dataset compared with the English datasets. For example, 
when using style markers only, C4.5 achieved average accuracies of 
86.28% and 74.29% for the English newsgroup and email datasets, while 
for the Chinese dataset it only achieved an average accuracy of 54.83%. 
A possible reason was that only 67 Chinese style markers were used in 
our current experiments, significantly fewer than the 205 style markers 
used with the English dataset. We expect to achieve higher prediction 
performances if additional Chinese style markers are identified and 
included. We also observed that when structural features were added all 
three algorithms achieved relatively high precision, recall, and accuracies 
(from 71% to 83%) for the Chinese dataset. Considering the significant 
language differences, our proposed approach to the problem of online 
message identity tracing appears promising in a multilingual context. 
8.2 Case Study 12: Feature Selection for Writeprint 
Unlike conventional crimes, there are no fingerprints to be found in 
cybercrime. Fortunately, there is another type of print, which we call 
"writeprint," hidden in people's writings. Similar to fingerprints, writeprint 
is composed of multiple features, such as vocabulary richness, length of 
sentences, use of function words, layout of paragraphs, and keywords. These 
writeprint features can represent an author's writing style, which is usually 
consistent across his or her writings, and further become the basis of 
authorship analysis. This study is aimed at introducing a method of 
identifying the key writeprint features for authors of online messages to 
facilitate identity tracing in cybercrime investigation. 
A number of studies have shown the discriminating power of different 
types of features. Furthermore, researchers attempt to identify an optimal set 
of features for authorship identification. Most previous studies of feature 
choice compared different types of features. Even if a type of feature is 
effective for authorship identification, some features in this type may be 
irrelevant or redundant, hence reducing the prediction accuracy. For 
Protecting Critical Infrastructure and Key Assets 11 1 
instance, de Vel et al. observed a reduction in performance when the number 
of function word features was increased from 122 to 320 (de Vel, 2001). 
Feature selection should be undertaken to remove features that do not 
contribute to prediction. However, few studies have been conducted to select 
key features for authorship identification at the individual feature level. In 
addition, extracting a large number of features from online messages is time- 
consuming and may induce errors. Therefore, it is important to identify the 
key writeprint features for authorship identification of online messages. Due 
to the multilingual characteristic of online messages, in this study we 
examine writeprint features for different languages, i.e., English and 
Chinese. 
Since features are regarded as an abstract representation of writeprint, the 
quality of the feature selection directly influences this representation. 
Feature selection techniques aim to select a subset of features that are 
relevant to the target concept, i.e., writeprint in this study. There are a 
variety of well developed methods in the pattern recognition and data mining 
domains to identify important features. Liu and Motoda summarized past 
studies of feature selection in a general framework (Liu & Motoda, 1998). 
The process of feature selection can be viewed as a search problem in 
feature space. Exhaustive search and heuristic search are two major search 
strategies. In this study we proposed a genetic algorithm-based (GA) feature 
selection model to identify writeprint features. In such a model each 
chromosome represents a feature subset, where its length is the total number 
of candidate features, and each bit indicates whether a feature is selected or 
not. Thus, the fitness value of each chromosome is defined as the accuracy 
of the corresponding classifier. By applying genetic operators in the 
successive generations, the GA model can generate different combinations 
of features to achieve the highest fitness value. Therefore, the feature subset 
corresponding to the highest accuracy of classification along all the 
generations is regarded as the optimum. The selected features in this subset 
are the key writeprint features to discriminate the writing styles of different 
authors. 
To test the feasibility of authorship identification and to identify the key 
writeprint features for online messages, the two online message testbeds 
(English and Chinese) described in the previous section were used. To 
compare the discriminating power of the full feature set and the optimal set, 
30-fold pair-wise t-tests were conducted respectively for the English and 
Chinese datasets. As shown in Table 8-1, the GA-based model identified a 
feature subset with about half of the full set as the key features, i.e., 134 out 
of 270 for English, and 56 out of 114 for Chinese. For the English dataset, 
the optimal feature set achieved a classification accuracy of 99.01%, which 
is significantly higher than the 97.85% achieved by the full set (p-value = 
112 INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY INFORMATICS 
0.0417). For the Chinese dataset, the optimal feature set achieved a 
classification accuracy of 93.56%, which is higher than the 92.42% achieved 
by the full set, but not significantly (p-value = 0.1270). In general, using the 
optimal feature subset we can achieve a comparable (if not higher) accuracy 
of authorship identification.

The effect of feature selection is significant and promising. Furthermore, 
we discovered that the selected key feature subset included all four types of 
features. This is consistent with our previous study in (Zheng et al., 2003), 
which showed that each type of feature contributes to the predictive power 
of the classification model. In particular, the relatively high proportion of

The results from Table 8-2 have some interesting implications. Since - - 
some features in the full feature set may be irrelevant for online messages, 
Protecting Critical Infrastructure and Key Assets 113 
the frequency of characters related to online messages (e.g., "@," "$") 
instead of other common ones (e.g., "A," "E") were selected. In addition, 
since some features may only provide redundant information, the total 
number of upper-case letters1 total number of characters was identified as a 
key feature, while the frequency of lower-case letters was discarded. 
Similarly, only one vocabulary richness measure, e.g., Yule's K or Honore's 
R, was selected and others were ignored. Since online messages are often 
short in length and flexible in style, structural layout traits such as the 
average length of paragraphs became more useful. In addition, content- 
specific features are highly related to their context. Hence features such as 
"sale" and "check" were identified as the key content-specific features for 
the English dataset based on sales of pirated software1CDs. In other contexts, 
different content-specific features should be identified and used accordingly. 
These selected key features of writeprint can effectively represent the 
distinct writing style of each author and further assist us to identify the 
authorship of new messages. 
8.3 Case Study 13: Developing an Arabic Authorship 
Model 
The evolution of the Internet as a major international communication 
medium has spawned the advent of a multilingual dimension. Application of 
authorship identification techniques across multilingual web content is 
important due to increased globalization and the ensuing security issues that 
are created. 
Arabic is one of the six official languages of the United Nations and the 
mother tongue of over 300 million people. The language is gaining interest 
due to its socio-political importance and differences from Indo-European 
languages. The morphological challenges pertaining to Arabic pose several 
critical problems for authorship identification techniques. These problems 
could be partially responsible for the lack of previous authorship analysis 
studies relating to Arabic. 
In this study, we apply an existing framework for authorship 
identification to Arabic web forum messages. Techniques and features are 
incorporated to address the specific characteristics of Arabic, resulting in the 
creation of an Arabic language model. We also present a comparison of 
English and Arabic language models. 
Most previous authorship studies have only focused on English, with a 
few studies done on Greek and Chinese. Stamamatos et al. applied 
authorship identification to a corpus of Greek newspaper articles 
(Stamamtos et al., 2001). Peng et al. conducted experiments on English 
documents, Chinese novels, and Greek newspapers using an n-gram model 
114 INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY INFORMATICS 
(Peng et al., 2003). Zheng et al. performed authorship identification on 
English and Chinese web forum messages (Zheng et al., 2003). In all 
previous studies, English results were better than other languages. Applying 
authorship identification features across different languages is not without its 
difficulties. Since most writing style characteristics were designed for 
English, they may not always be applicable or relevant for other languages. 
Structural and other linguistic differences can create feature extraction 
nightmares. 
Arabic is a Semitic language, meaning that it belongs to the group of 
Afro-Asian languages which also includes Hebrew. It is written from right 
to left with letters in the same word being joined together, similar to English 
cursive writing. Semitic languages have several characteristics that can 
cause difficulties for authorship analysis. These challenges include 
properties such as inflection, diacritics, word length, and elongation. 
Inflection: 
Inflection is the derivation of stem words from a root. Although the root 
has a meaning, it is not a word but rather a class that contains stem instances 
(words). Stems are created by adding affixes (prefixes, infixes, and suffixes) 
to the root using specific patterns. Words with common roots are 
semantically related. Arabic roots are 3-5 letter consonant combinations with 
the majority being 3-letters. Al-Fedaghi and Al-Anzi believe that as many 
as 85% of Arabic words are derived from a tri-lateral root, suggesting that 
Arabic is highly inflectional (Al-Fedaghi and Al-Anzi, 1989). Inflection can 
cause feature extraction problems for lexical features because high levels of 
inflection increase the number of possible words, since a word can take on 
numerous forms. 
Diacritics: 
Diacritics are markings above or below letters, used to indicate special 
phonetic values. An example of diacritics in English would be the little 
markings found on top of the letter "e" in the word rCsum6. These markings 
alter the pronunciation and meaning of the word. Arabic uses diacritics in 
every word to represent short vowels, consonant lengths, and relationships 
between words. 
Word Length: 
Arabic words tend to be shorter than English words. The shorter length 
of Arabic words reduces the effectiveness of many lexical features. The 
short-word count feature, used to track words whose length is 3-letters or 
smaller, may have little discriminatory potential when applied to Arabic. 
Additionally, the word-length distribution may also be less effective since 
Arabic word-length distributions have a smaller range. 
Protecting Critical Infrastructure and Key Assets 115 
Elongation: 
Arabic words are sometimes stretched out or elongated. This is done for 
purely stylistic reasons using a special Arabic character that resembles a 
dash ("-"). Elongation is possible because Arabic characters are joined 
during writing. Table 8-3 shows an example of elongation. The word 
MZKR ("remind") is elongated with the addition of four dashes between the 
"M" and the "Z." Although elongation provides an important authorship 
identification feature, it can also create problems.

Our testbed consisted of English and Arabic datasets. The English 
dataset was adapted from Zheng et al.'s study and consists of messages from 
USENET newsgroups (Zheng et al., 2003). The dataset identifies 20 authors 
engaged in potentially illegal activities relating to computer software and 
music sales and trading. The data consists of 20 messages per author for a 
total of 400 messages. The Arabic dataset was extracted from Yahoo groups 
and is also composed of 20 authors and 20 messages per author. These 
authors discuss a broader range of topics including political ideologies and 
social issues in the Arab world. Based on previous studies, there are 
numerous classification techniques that can provide adequate performance. 
In this research, we adopted two popular machine learning classifiers; ID3 
decision trees and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The Arabic feature set 
was modeled after the English feature set. It includes 410 features, with the 
key differences highlighted in Table 8-4. 
The results for the comparison of the different feature types and 
techniques are summarized in Table 8-5 and Figure 8-4. In both datasets the 
accuracy kept increasing with the addition of more feature types. The 
maximum accuracy was achieved with the use of SVM and all feature types 
for English and Arabic. Using all features with the SVM classifier, we were 
able to achieve an accuracy level of 85.43% for the Arabic dataset; a level 
lower than the 96.09% achieved for the English dataset.

In the future we would like to analyze authorship differences at the group 
level within a specific language. Identification of unique writing style 
characteristics for speakers of the same languages across different 
geographic locations (e.g., Iraq vs. Palestine), cultures (e.g., Sunni vs. 
Shiite), and interest (e.g., terrorist) groups could prove to be an interesting 
endeavor. 
8.4 Future Directions 
Cyber-infrastructure protection and cyber-trust are some of the most 
pressing IS1 research topics of relevance to IT researchers. Unlike traditional 
critical infrastructure (e.g., highways, bridges, dams, and etc.), cyber- 
infrastructure can be attacked from any part of the world. The openness of 
the Internet protocol also invites unwanted and unforeseeable intrusions and 
disruptions. International terrorists and criminals have long been using the 
Internet for their illegal and covert activities. Much IS1 research is needed in 
intrusion detection, computer forensics, Internet identity frauds, and grid 
computing and sensors in the next decade. 
8.5 Questions for Discussion 
1. What are the research opportunities in NSF cyber-infrastructure and 
cyber-trust programs? What are some ways to leverage national security

DEFENDING AGAINST CATASTROPHIC 
TERRORISM 
Chapter Overview 
Terrorist attacks can cause devastating damage to a society through the use 
of chemical, biological, or radiological weapons. Biological attacks may 
cause contamination, infectious disease outbreaks, and significant loss of 
life. Information systems that can efficiently and effectively collect, access, 
analyze, and report infectious disease data can help prevent, detect, respond 
to, and manage these attacks. In this chapter we discuss our ongoing 
BioPortal research and system development efforts motivated to address 
some of these challenges. 
Defending Against Catastrophic Terrorism 121 
9.1 Case Study 14: BioPortal for Disease and Bioagent 
Surveillance 
Our initial BioPortal research focuses on two prominent infectious 
diseases: West Nile Virus (WNV) and Botulism (BOT). These two diseases 
were chosen because of their significant public health and national security 
implications and the availability of related datasets with our research 
partners. We developed a research prototype, called the WV-BOT Portal 
system, which provides integrated, web-enabled access to a variety of 
distributed data sources including the New York State Department of Health 
(NYSDOH), the California Department of Health Services (CADHS), and 
some other federal sources (e.g., United States Geological Survey, USGS). It 
also provides advanced information visualization capabilities as well as 
predictive modeling support. 
Architecturally, the WNV-BOT Portal consists of three major 
components: a web portal, a data store, and a communications backbone. 
The web portal component implements the user interface and provides the 
following main functionalities: (1) searching and querying available 
WNVIBOT datasets, (2) visualizing WNVIBOT datasets using spatial- 
temporal visualization, (3) accessing analysis and prediction functions, and 
(4) accessing the alerting mechanism. 
To enable data interoperability, we use Health Level Seven (HL7) 
standards (http://www.hl7.org/) as the main storage format. In our data 
warehousing approach, contributing data providers transmit data to WNV- 
BOT Portal as HL7-compliant XML messages (through a secure network 
connection if necessary). To alleviate potential computational performance 
problems associated with this HL7 XML-based approach, we have identified 
a core set of data fields based on which searches could be performed 
efficiently. 
An important function of the data store layer is data ingest and access 
control. The data ingest control module is responsible for checking the 
integrity and authenticity of data feeds from the underlying information 
sources. The access control module is responsible for granting and 
restricting user access to sensitive data. 
The communication backbone component enables data exchanges 
between the WNV-BOT Portal and the underlying WNVIBOT sources based 
upon the CDC's National Electronic Disease Surveillance System (NEDSS) 
and HL7 standards. It uses a collection of source-specific "connectors" to 
communicate with underlying sources. We use the connector linking 
NYSDOH's Health Information Network (HIN) system and WNV-BOT 
Portal to illustrate a typical design of such connectors. The data from HIN to 
the portal system is transmitted in a "push" manner. HIN sends secure Public 
INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY INFORMATICS 
Health Information Network Messaging System (PHIN MS) messages to the 
portal at pre-specified time intervals. The connector at the portal side runs a 
data receiver daemon listening for incoming messages. After a message is 
received, the connector checks for data integrity syntactically and invokes 
the data normalization subroutine. Then the connector stores the verified 
message in the portal's internal data store through its data ingest control 
module. Other data sources (e.g., those from USGS) may have "pull"-type 
connectors which periodically download information from the source web 
sites and examine and store data in the portal's internal data store. 
The WNV-BOT Portal makes available the Spatial Temporal Visualizer 
(STV) (Buetow et al., 2003) to facilitate exploration of infectious disease 
case data and to summarize query results. The STV has three integrated and 
synchronized views: periodic, timeline, and GIs. Figure 9-1 illustrates how 
these three views can be used to explore an infectious disease dataset. The 
top-left panel shows the GIs view. The user can select multiple datasets to 
be shown on the map in a layered manner using the checkboxes. The top- 
right panel corresponds to the timeline view displaying the occurrences of 
various cases using a Gantt chart-like display. The user can also access case 
details easily using the tree display located left of the timeline display. 
Below the timeline view is the periodic view through which the user can 
identify periodic temporal patterns (e.g., which months have an unusually 
high number of cases). The bottom portion of the interface allows the user to 
specify subsets of data to be displayed and analyzed. 
Our project has supported exploration of, and experimentation with, 
technological infrastructures needed for the full-fledged implementation of a 
national infectious disease information infrastructure and has helped foster 
information sharing and collaboration among related government agencies at 
state and federal levels. In addition, we have obtained important insights and 
hands-on experience with various important policy-related challenges faced 
by developing a national infrastructure. For example, a significant part of 
our project activity has been centered on developing privacy-sensitive data 
sharing agreements between project partners from different states. 
Our ongoing technical research is focusing on two aspects of infectious 
disease informatics: hotspot analysis and efficient alerting and dissemination. 
For WNV, localized clusters of dead birds typically identify high-risk disease 
areas. Automatic detection of dead bird clusters using hotspot analysis can help 
predict disease outbreaks and allocate prevention/control resources effectively. 
Initial experimental results indicate that these techniques are promising for 
disease informatics analysis. We are planning to augment existing predictive 
models by considering additional environmental factors (e.g., weather 
information, bird migration patterns) and tailoring data mining techniques for 
infectious disease datasets that have prominent temporal features.

9.2 Case Study 15: Hotspot Analysis and Surveillance 
In infectious disease informatics and bioterrorism studies, measurements 
of interest are often made at various locations and with timestamps. In the 
public health domain, the disease cases reported to the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention (CDC) through its National Notifiable Diseases 
Surveillance System are collected with timestamps at various places across 
the entire nation. Similar disease case reporting practices exist at state and 
local jurisdictions, typically with cases identified with specific geo-locations. 
Recent years have seen increasing interest in answering the following 
central questions of great practical importance arising in spatio-temporal 
data analysis and related predictive modeling: (a) How can we identify areas 
having exceptionally high or low measures? (b) How can we determine 
whether the unusual measures can be attributed to known random variations 
or are statistically significant? In the latter case, how do we assess the 
explanatory factors? (c) How can we identify any statistically significant 
changes (e.g., in rates of health syndromes or crime occurrences) in a timely 
manner in a geographic area? 
Two types of approaches have been developed in the literature to address 
some of these questions. The first type of approach is considered the 
124 INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY INFORMATICS 
retrospective model. It is aimed at testing statistically whether a disease is 
randomly distributed over space and time for a predefined geographical 
region during a predetermined time period. The second type of approach is 
prospective in nature, with repeated time periodic analyses targeted at 
identification of statistically significant changes in real time. Both 
approaches have been applied in security informatics practice. For instance, 
the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene collected 
geo-coded information concerning dead birds infected by West Nile Virus 
(WNV). Applying retrospective methods to avian fatality data, they were 
able to detect possible WNV outbreaks before human case data became 
available (Zeng et al., 2004). 
Our study focuses on retrospective models. Although a wide range of 
methods have been proposed for retrospective spatio-temporal data analysis, 
the space scan statistic, in particular, has become one of the most popular 
methods for detection of disease clusters and is being widely used by many 
public health departments and researchers. Algorithmically, the space scan 
statistic method imposes a circular window on the map under study and 
moves the center of the circle over the area so that at different positions the 
window includes different sets of neighboring cases. Over the course of data 
analysis, the method creates a large number of distinct circular windows 
(other shapes such as rectangle and ellipse have also been used), each with a 
different set of neighboring areas within it and each a possible candidate for 
containing a cluster of events. Conditioning on the observed total number of 
cases, the spatial scan statistic is defined as the maximum likelihood ratio 
over all possible circles. The likelihood ratio for a circle indicates how likely 
the observed data are given a differential rate of events within and outside 
the zone. 
Despite its success, there are a number of limitations associated with the 
scan statistic approach. First, its efficiency depends on the use of simple, 
fixed symmetrical shapes of regions. As a result, when the real underlying 
clusters do not conform to such shapes, the identified regions are often not 
well localized. Second, it is difficult to customize and fine-tune the 
clustering results using the scan statistic approach. Users often have different 
needs as to the level of granularity and number of the resulting clusters and 
they may have different degrees of tolerance regarding outliers. 
These limitations have motivated our research aimed at exploring and 
developing alternative and complementary modeling approaches for spatio- 
temporal data analysis in the context of security informatics. This case study 
reports our effort in studying two such approaches: Risk-adjusted Nearest 
Neighbor Hierarchical Clustering (RNNH), which was initially developed 
for crime analysis; and Risk-adjusted Support Vector Clustering (RSVC), a 
new hotspot analysis approach we have recently developed. 
Defending Against Catastrophic Terrorism 125 
Developed for crime hotspot analysis, RNNH is based on the well-known 
nearest neighbor hierarchical clustering (NNH) method, combining the 
hierarchical clustering capabilities with kernel density interpolation 
techniques. The standard NNH approach identifies clusters of data points 
that are close together (based on a threshold distance). Many such clusters, 
however, are due to some background or baseline factors (e.g., the 
population which is not evenly distributed over the entire area of interest). 
RNNH is primarily motivated to identify clusters of data points relative to 
the baseline factor. Algorithmically, it dynamically adjusts the threshold 
distance inversely proportional to some density measure of the baseline 
factor (e.g., the threshold should be shorter in regions where the population 
is high). Such density measures are computed using kernel density based on 
the distances between the location under study and some or all other data 
points. 
RSVC is the result of our recent attempt to combine the risk adjustment 
idea of RNNH with a modern, robust clustering mechanism such as Support 
Vector Machines (SVM) to improve the quality of hotspot analysis. SVMs 
are the most well-known of a class of algorithms that use the idea of kernel 
substitution. SVM-based data description and novelty detection (DDND) is 
particularly relevant to our research. SVM-based DDND methods are aimed 
at identifying the support of a data distribution. They can single out data 
clusters in complex shapes and have been well-tested in complex, noisy 
domains (e.g., handwritten symbol recognition). The standard version of 
SVM-based DDND does not tale into consideration baseline data points and 
therefore cannot be directly used in spatio-temporal data analysis. As such, 
we have developed a risk-adjusted variation, called RSVC, based on ideas 
similar to those in RNNH. In this new approach we first compute the kernel 
density estimations using the baseline data points and then adjust width 
parameter in the Gaussian kernel hnction based on such density estimations. 
We have conducted a series of computational studies to evaluate the 
effectiveness of the three hotspot analysis techniques (Satscan, RNNH, 
RSVC) discussed above. In our experiment, we used artificially generated 
datasets with known underlying probability distributions to precisely and 
quantitatively evaluate the efficacy of these techniques. We use the well- 
known measures from information retrieval to evaluate the performance of 
hotspot techniques: Precision, Recall, and F-Measure. In the spatial data 
analysis context, we define these measures as follows. 
Let A denote the size of the hotspot(s) identified by a given algorithm, B 
the size of the true hotspot(s), and C the size of the overlapped area between 
the algorithm-identified hotspot(s) and true hotspot(s). Precision is defined 
as CIA. Recall is defined as C/B. F-measure is defined as the harmonic mean 
of precision and recall (2 * Precision * Recall / (Precision + Recall)). High 
126 INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY INFORMATICS 
recall indicates low false negatives and high precision indicates low false 
positives. Notice that achieving a high level of one measure often impacts 
negatively achieving a high level of the other measure. F-measure 
represents a balance and trade-off between precision and recall. 
We report three artificially-generated scenarios with which we have 
experimented. In the first scenario, as shown in Figure 9-2, we first 
randomly generated 100 baseline points in one circle (whose center is 
around (6.7, 8.2) on the graph). 
We then generated 200 case points of interest in total. The first 100 
points were generated inside of the baseline circle. (As such, these data 
points do not represent a new unusual hotspot.) The next 100 points were 
generated within another circle (whose center is around (14.3, 10.2)). It is 
clear that the only true hotspot is this second circle. 
To make the problem more interesting, we introduced some noise -- 30 
outlier baseline points and 40 outlier case points over the entire map. For 
statistical testing purposes, we repeated the above data generation process 30 
times to produce 30 instances of the template scenario by moving the centers 
of the two circles randomly across the map and also by varying the distances 
between them so long as they did not overlap. 
To collect the performance data, we ran all hotspot analysis methods 
under study on all the problem instances. Table 9-1 summarizes these 
methods' average performance across all instances. Overall RSVC achieves 
the best F-score at 84.5%.

Two additional scenarios have been investigated in our study. In Scenario 
2, the true hotspots are the two pieces left of a rectangle when its middle 
section is removed by a circle. In Scenario 3, the true spot is a square with its 
circular-shaped center removed. The purpose behind the use of these 
scenarios is to test how robust these hotspot methods are when dealing with 
hotspots of irregular shape. Tables 9-2 and 9-3 summarize the average 
performance of these methods when applied to identify hotspots in 30 
randomly-generated instances of Scenario 2 and Scenario 3, respectively.

Some observations are in order. In general, RSVC and the spatial scan 
method have similar levels of recall across different scenarios. However, 
RSVC has higher precision than the spatial scan method (confirmed by 
statistical tests). RNNH has the highest precision level but typically with the 
lowest recall. When considering the combined F-measure, RSVC 
consistently delivers the best results. For complex, irregular shapes, RSVC 
typically performs the best among the three techniques. We believe RSVC 
could be a strong candidate for hotspot identification in national security 
applications (e.g., disease surveillance, crime hotspot analysis). 
9.3 Future Directions 
Over the past ten years we have witnessed the many devastating global 
impacts of infectious diseases such as SARS, foot-and-mouth disease, avian 
influenza, West Nile Virus, etc. Many of these diseases have strong 
implications for national security (i.e., as bioagents). Disease and bioagent 
surveillance is one of the most critical research topics of relevance to 
homeland security. 
Traditionally, disease informatics research is conducted by 
epidemiologists in universities and local, state, and federal public health 
agencies. However, there are many opportunities for advanced information 
sharing, retrieval, and visualization research which could adapt some of the 
new digital library, search engine, and information visualization techniques. 
In addition, the discipline can benefit greatly from new temporal and spatial 
data mining techniques that could complement the prevailing statistical 
analysis techniques in epidemiology. Standards and ontologies are also 
critically needed in disease informatics research. 
9.4 Questions for Discussion 
1. What are the prevailing techniques for disease and syndromic 
surveillance in epidemiology? What are the assumptions? 
2. What is the current status of the BioWatch program at DHS and the 
BioSense program at CDC? What are their strengths and deficiencies? 
What are some research opportunities? 
3. What are some ways to work with local and state public health agencies 
on diseases informatics research? What are the available datasets? 
4. How should the data confidentiality issue of animal and human disease 
information be addressed?

EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS AND 
RESPONSE 
Chapter Overview 
In case of a national emergency, prompt and effective responses are critical 
to reduce the damage resulting from an attack. In addition to the systems that 
are designed to defend against catastrophes, information technologies that 
help develop response plans, identify experts, train response professionals, 
and manage consequences are beneficial to society. Moreover, information 
systems that provide social and psychological support to the victims of 
terrorist attacks can also help society recover from disasters. In this chapter 
we present two case studies. The first case study uses bibliometric analysis 
to help identify modern terrorism research experts in the U.S. and 
internationally. The second case study uses the chatterbot dialog system to 
help locate terrorism-related information. 
Emergency Preparedness and Response 133 
10.1 Case Study 16: Mapping Terrorism Research 
The recent escalation of global terrorism has attracted a growing number 
of new, non-traditional research communities owing to the multi-disciplinary 
dimensions required to gain a better understanding of the terrorism 
phenomenon. As a result, new researchers face information overload, 
access, and knowledge discovery challenges. This study provides a 
longitudinal analysis of terrorism publications from 1965 to 2003, to identify 
the intellectual structure, changes, and characteristics of the terrorism field. 
It uses bibliometric and citation analysis to identify core terrorism 
researchers, their productivity, and knowledge dissemination patterns. 
For bibliometric analysis, our initial unit of analysis is the author, whose 
individual publications, subject areas, journal titles, and institutions provide 
subsequent analyses. Our first step is to identify a core set of authors and 
their related publications. We compiled a list of authors from several 
sources: terrorism publications (Schmid and Jongman, 1988; Reid, 1997), 
active terrorism experts identified by the KnowNet virtual community 
(organized by the Sandia National Laboratory), and terrorism research center 
portals identified on the Internet. Authors identified on the web may 
represent individuals whose prominence has recently been established or 
those who have reputable international or non-traditional perspectives on 
terrorism. 
Kennedy and Lum's (2003) list of terrorism research organizations was 
used to identify a good number of terrorism web-based research portals. We 
also focused on the Terrorism Research Center (TRC) portal because it is 
highly recommended by terrorism experts. Using backlink searches in 
Google, we found thousands of web pages hyperlinked to TRC. We 
followed TRC's external links to 28 terrorism research organizations and 
gathered names of terrorism researchers mentioned on the web sites. A total 
of 13 1 unique names were identified from using the combined pool of 28 
terrorism research center portals, the KnowNet virtual community's 
recommendations, and those reported by Schmid and Jongman (1988) and 
Reid (1997). 
A bibliography of English-language terrorism publications was compiled 
for each researcher using commercial databases. The publications include 
journal articles, books, book chapters, reviews, notes, newspaper articles, 
conferences papers, and reports. For each core researcher, bibliographic data 
describing their terrorism-related publications was retrieved. After the 
citation analysis was conducted, 42 authors were identified as core terrorism 
researchers based on citation count. A total of 284 researchers/coauthors and 
their 882 publications made up the sample for this study. 
134 INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY INFORMATICS 
The 42 core researchers are mainly affiliated with academic institutions 
(23), think tanks (15), media organizations (3), and the government (1). 
Their bases of operation are located in ten countries including the U.S. (29), 
the U.K. (4), Ireland (I), Germany (I), Australia (I), Israel (I), Canada (I), 
France (I), Netherlands (I), and Singapore (1). Specifically, six researchers 
are from the Rand Corporation including Jenkins, the founder of the Rand 
terrorism program; three are from the Centre for the Study of Terrorism and 
Political Violence (CSTPV) at St. Andrews, Scotland; and another three are 
from the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), Georgetown 
University. 
To further explore the core terrorism researchers' knowledge creation 
patterns, authorship data which identify their collaboration patterns and 
research groups were exploited. There was a high level of coauthorship 
among the 42 core terrorism researchers where the majority of the 
researchers (90%) had coauthors. For example, Alexander has 82 coauthors, 
followed by researchers from the Rand Corporation, such as Jenkins, with 
68, Hoffman with 50, and Ronfeldt with 41 coauthors. Wilkinson and 
Laqueur had less than nine coauthors. They are among the group of core 
researchers with high author productivity levels. Eight core researchers did 
not have any coauthors. We also found that Alexander's extensive list of 
publications is due to his collaborative efforts with 82 coauthors which 
enabled him to publish books that include 57 anthologies and 10 
bibliographies. 
Further investigation of the coauthorship relationships provides an 
understanding of the researchers' collaboration patterns. Figure 10-1 shows 
the coauthorship network of core terrorism researchers. The nodes represent 
researchers who coauthored papers. 
Some of the most active clusters in the bottom-right corner of Figure 
10-1 are the Rand research teams led by Jenkins and Hoffman. Gunaratna, 
although not employed by Rand, is listed in this cluster because he 
coauthored publications with Chalk and Hoffman. Hoffman, Gunaratna's 
Ph.D. advisor at St. Andrews University, Scotland, founded St. Andrews' 
Centre for the Study of Terrorism and Political Violence (CSTPV) and 
created the Rand-St. Andrews Terrorism Incident Database, which provides 
data for their studies (Hughes, 2003). 
For the cluster involving Ranstorp (the bottom-left corner of Figure 10-1) 
from CSTPV, the network is sparse and shares few coauthorships. As 
chairman of the Advisory Board for CSTPV, Wilkinson has a few 
collaborations with Alexander but none with researchers at CSTPV who are 
in this sample. Another cluster includes researchers such as Alexander and 
Cline (middle of Figure 10-1) at the Center for Strategic and International 
Studies (CSIS). This cluster displays a pattern of one to many coauthors 
Emergency Preparedness and Response 135 
because Alexander has 82 coauthors. In this particular case, we found that 
coauthorships do not seem to be sustainable because many authors produced 
only a single publication with Alexander and did not publish with other 
terrorism researchers in this sample.

Figure 10-1. Terrorism researchers' coauthorship network. 
Since this study is limited to English language publications, 43 of the 13 1 
recommended terrorism researchers have been excluded from our data 
because their publications were not retrieved. Another inherent limitation of 
this study brought about by the use of the IS1 Web of Science is the 
exclusion of terrorism studies found in e-journals, congressional 
testimonials, and recent conference papers as well as non-refereed web 
materials. This last limitation may have precluded the publications from 
international, emerging thought leaders. 
Despite the foregoing limitations, this study can be seen as significant in 
that it has assembled useful information that can help lead novice 
researchers to core terrorism researchers and their key contributions in a 
challenging field that is growing rapidly. Specifically, it helps identify the 
most frequently cited terrorism researchers and their publications, 
dissemination, and collaboration patterns. From this, one may better 
understand the structure of terrorism research and locate literature produced 
in particular areas of terrorism. It is a field whose profound implications to 
our future societies are beyond comprehension.

10.2 Case Study 17: A Dialog System for Terrorism 
Resources 
Terrorism education has become a topic of interest lately. With many 
agencies and private organizations scrambling to provide terrorism 
information, the actual process of finding relevant material can sometimes 
become lost in the chaos. To the credit of the Department of Homeland 
Security and several private organizations, there is some valuable 
information available; however, it is mainly geared towards first responders 
and not the general public. 
In both the "9-1 1 Commission Report" and "Making the Nation Safer," 
the authors propose to bridge this gap through the use of C3; systems 
embodying Command, Control, and Communications elements. These 
systems would allow for the deployment of communications channels during 
an emergency to support decision management as well as communicate 
instructions to the public (Moore and Gibbs, 2003). 
One potential approach to C3 is through the use of ALICEbots. 
ALICEbots (Artificial Linguistic Internet Chat Entity robots) are a type of 
Question-Answer (QA) chatterbot developed in 1995 by Richard Wallace 
(Wallace, 2004). The advantage of these chatterbots is in their ability to be 
quickly programmed with terrorism-specific knowledge, as well as their 
robust and human-like nature. ALICEbots are built first and foremost for 
conversation and are a promising vehicle in disseminating terrorism-related 
information to the public. 
ALICEbots work by matching user input against pre-existing XML- 
based input patterns and returning the template response. This simple 
method of conversational mimicking eliminates the computational overhead 
that would normally be associated with deeper reasoning systems. The 
technique can also permit expansion into new knowledge domains, allowing 
the ALICEbot to convey an 'expert appearance' (Wallace, 2004). 
In our research, we aimed to examine the efficacy of shallow Question- 
Answer (QA) systems for disseminating terrorism-related information to the 
general public. We created three modified ALICEbots, which differed from 
each other on the dimension of terrorism knowledge bases used. One 
chatterbot used only general conversational knowledge, the second used only 
terrorism domain knowledge, and the third was a combination of both 
conversation and terrorism knowledge. Referred to as TARA (Terrorism 
Activity Resource Application) in our research, our system design was based 
on a modified version of the ALICE Program D chatterbot engine which is 
freely available at www.ALICEbot.org. There are some notable differences 
between TARA and ALICE, as illustrated in Table 10-1. The only 
component that remained unaltered was the actual Chat Engine.

We used three chatterbots with differing knowledge bases. The control 
chatterbot "Dialog," the general conversationalist, was loaded with the 
standard knowledge set that allowed ALICE to win the early Loebner 
contests (of machine conversation). This set consists of 41,873 knowledge- 
based entries. The second chatterbot "Domain," was loaded with 10,491 
terrorism-related entries. The third chatterbot "Both," was a summation of 
"Dialog" and "Domain," which can carry on a general conversation and 
easily handle terrorism inquiries as well. It contains 52,354 entries, 10 less 
than a true summation because of an overlap between the dialog and domain 
knowledge bases. 
Terrorism entries were collected through a mixture of automatic and 
manual means. The majority were gathered automatically from several 
reputable web sites including http://www.terrorismanswers.com and 
http://www.ll-sept.org. Manual entry was used sparingly to augment the 
terrorism knowledge set. 
For our system comparison research we used ninety participants, thirty 
for each chatterbot, who were a mixture of undergraduate and graduate 
students taking various Management of Information Systems classes. 
Participants were randomly assigned to one of the chatterbots, asked to 
interact with the system for approximately one-half hour, and permitted to 
talk about any terrorism-related topic. 
The evaluation method of chatterbot responses was an integrated process 
where users would chat a line and then immediately evaluate the chatterbot's 
response. Users were asked to evaluate each line with the following two 
measures; appropriateness of response (Yes/No), and satisfaction level of the 
response using a Likert scale of values (1-7). Users were also given the 
opportunity to provide open-ended comments on a line by line basis.

Measurements were conducted on the appropriateness and satisfaction 
rating of the chatterbot responses. Because the "Both" chatterbot is 
composed of dialog and domain parts, we took the "Both" chatterbot and 
broke its responses into its constituent parts of dialog and domain. We then 
compared those results against the actual Dialog and Domain chatterbots. 
This comparison is shown in Table 10-2.

Average response satisfaction rating 
When comparing the dialog component of "Both" against the actual 
Dialog chatterbot, the "Both" component rated higher in response 
appropriateness, 68.4% to 66.3%, as per our expectation. When looking at 
the domain component of "Both" against the Domain chatterbot, again the 
"Both" component rated higher, 39.6% compared to 21.6%. Likewise, 
Response Satisfaction scores from the "Both" chatterbot rate higher than the 
corresponding "Actual" chatterbots. This analysis shows that the "Both" 
chatterbot performed better in its constituent areas compared against the 
stand-alone chatterbots. We believe that this is the result of the dialog 
portion responding to unrecognized queries and steering communication 
back to terrorism topics. 
We investigated the inputlresponse pairs of the "Both" chatterbot. In 
particular we were interested in only those user inputs which were in the 
form of a question (68.4% of the terrorism domain inputs were 
interrogatives). Table 10-3 summarizes the most frequently observed 
interrogatives.

Investigating the interrogatives further, it was found that the interrogative 
"what" started the most user queries at 27.5% of all queries. We had 
expected that interrogatives beginning with "wh*" would be the most 
prevalent and indeed they were, making up 5 1.5% of all interrogatives. It is 
interesting to note how often "DO" and "Is" were used, as these were 
unexpected surprises. In the vein of work done by Moore and Gibbs (2003) 
where students used the chatterbot as a search engine, focusing future efforts 
of knowledge collection at these selected interrogatives should best improve 
chatterbot accuracy. 
In the future, it would be a good idea to investigate adding more 
knowledge to the system. Although our domain-specific knowledge base 
appeared to be sufficient for the task, it would be interesting to test even 
larger corpuses of knowledge and see what impact they may have over 
dialog knowledge. Another possible aspect worth considering is the addition 
of a C3 variant, the "I'm Alive" boards. Following the September 1 lth 
attacks, multiple boards sprang up around New York City announcing the 
names and present shelter location of survivors to concerned friends and 
family members outside of the disaster area. Adding such functionality 
would be a simple programming exercise and would provide a quicker and 
more concerted way for bidirectional communications. 
10.3 Future Directions 
There is little academic research in addressing the needs of the first 
responders and general public during and after a tragic terrorist event. The 
devastating effects of such an event often cause significant communication, 
psychological, and societal chaos well beyond the physical and monetary 
damages the attack has created. Under the support of the NSF Digital 
Government Program, several workshops have been conducted to address 
the needs of the emergency response community. Both technical (e.g., 
communication interoperability, rescue robots, and disaster relief logistics) 
and policy (e.g., emergency response authority and plan) challenges and 
research opportunities were identified. The workshops suggested new 
funding in emergency preparedness and response research and proposed an 
academic-agency partnership in addressing short-term and long-term 
research issues.

educating the public? How can the Internet help in such activities? 
Chapter 11 
THE PARTNERSHIP AND 
COLLABORATION FRAMEWORK 
Chapter Overview 
IS1 research requires a close partnership between academic researchers and 
agency practitioners. Researchers would benefit from the testbed and inputs 
provided by domain experts. On the other hand, law enforcement and 
intelligence practitioners could leverage advanced information technologies 
for their works. However, developing a win-win relationship is not always 
easy. Agencies often have a pressing and immediate need that cannot wait 
for long-term, academic research. Data confidentiality concerns may often 
create barriers for collaboration. In this chapter we present selected research 
collaboration challenges facing IS1 researchers and describe our COPLINK 
project experience in addressing these challenges. In particular, we present 
samples of a user data license and Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) 
that are useful for national security research and collaboration partnership. 
The Partnership and Collaboration Framework 143 
11.1 Introduction 
To accomplish the six critical mission areas of national security the 
Department of Homeland Security has proposed to establish a network of 
laboratories consisting of satellite research centers of excellence across the 
nation. The purpose is to create a multidisciplinary environment for 
developing technologies to counter various threats to homeland security. 
However, information sharing and collaboration across different 
jurisdictions, agencies, and research institutes is not merely a technical issue. 
A variety of social, organizational, and political barriers need to addressed, 
including: 
Security and con$dentiality. In the intelligence and law enforcement 
domain, security is of great concern. Data regarding crimes, criminals, 
terrorist organizations, and potential terrorist attacks may be highly 
sensitive and confidential. Improper use of data could lead to fatal 
consequences. 
Trust and willingness to share information. Different agencies may not 
be motivated to share information and collaborate if there is no 
immediate gain. They may also fear that information being shared would 
be misused, resulting in legal liabilities. 
Data ownership and access control. Who owns a particular dataset? Who 
is allowed to access, aggregate, or input data? Who owns the derivative 
data (knowledge)? For both original and derivative data, who is allowed 
to distribute them to whom? 
As a 
informatic 
Artificial 
become a 
leading research center for law enforcement and intelligence 
m and knowledge management, the NSF COPLINK Center at the 
Intelligence (AI) Lab of the University of Arizona is intended to 
part of the national network of IS1 research laboratories. During its 
development over the past decade the COPLINK Center has encountered 
many of these non-technical challenges in its partnerships with various law 
enforcement and federal agencies. We present some of our experiences and 
lessons learned in this section. 
11.2 Ensuring Data Security and Confidentiality 
In any information sharing initiative, it is essential to make sure that the 
data shared between agencies is secure and that the privacy of individuals is 
respected. In our research we have taken the necessary measures to ensure 
data privacy, security, and confidentiality. Data shared between law 
enforcement agencies, such as the Tucson Police Department (TPD), 
144 INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY INFORMATICS 
Phoenix Police Department (PPD), and Tucson Customs and Border Patrol 
(CBP), contained only law enforcement data and was available only to 
individuals screened by these agencies using a combination of TPD 
Background Check, Employee Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA), and the 
Terminal Operator Certificate (TOC) test. 
All personnel who have access to law enforcement data fill out 
background forms provided by TPD and have their fingerprints taken at 
TPD. They also sign a non-disclosure agreement provided by TPD. In 
addition, they take the TOC test every year. The background information 
and fingerprints are then checked by TPD investigators to ensure lack of 
involvement in criminal activity and for verification of identity. 
In addition to the above forms and test, all law enforcement data in the 
University of Arizona's COPLINK Center reside behind a firewall and in a 
secure room accessible only by activated cards to those who have met the 
above security criteria. As soon as an employee stops working on projects 
related to law enforcement data, their card is de-activated. However, the 
NDA is perpetual and remains in effect even after a researcher or employee 
leaves. Such requirements are similar to those imposed upon non- 
commissioned civilian personnel in a police department. 
A sample individual user data license agreement is shown in Figure 1 1 - 1. 
The sample document was developed by university contracting officers and 
lawyers in several institutions and government agencies. Most of the terms 
and conditions are applicable to national security projects that demand 
confidentiality. 
11.3 Reaching Agreements among Partners 
Federal, state, and local regulations require that agreements between 
agencies within their respective jurisdictions receive advance approval from 
their governing hierarchy. This precludes informal information sharing 
agreements between those agencies. We found that requirements varied from 
agency to agency according to the statutes by which they were governed. 
For instance, the ordinances governing information sharing by the city of 
Tucson varied somewhat from those governing the city of Phoenix. This 
necessitated numerous attempts and passes at proposed documents by 
each city's law enforcement and legal staff before a final draft could be 
settled upon for approval by the city councils. 
We found in general that similar language existed in the ordinances and 
statutes governing this exchange but the process varied significantly.

148 INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY INFORMATICS 
It appears as though the size of the jurisdiction is proportional to the level 
of bureaucracy required. Our experience in developing an agreement 
between agencies in Arizona and agencies in California follows this premise. 
Negotiating a contract between the University of Arizona and ARJIS 
(Automated Regional Justice Information System) of Southern California 
required six to nine months of discussion between legal staff, contract 
specialists, and agency officials. We are hopeful that many of the solutions 
to barriers in that process may be applied to the formation of formal 
agreements for information sharing with other agencies across state 
boundaries. 
TPD has recently developed a generic Inter-Governmental Agreement 
(IGA) that could be adopted between different law enforcement agencies. 
This IGA was condensed from MOUs (Memorandum of Understanding), 
policies, and agreements that previously existed in various forms between 
numerous agencies. The IGA was drafted in a generic manner, including 
language from those laws, but excluding reference to any particular chapter 
or section. This allowed the required verbiage to exist in the document 
without being specific to any jurisdiction. 
Sharing of information between agencies with disparate information 
systems has also led to bridging boundaries between software vendors and 
agencies (their customers). We took care not to violate licensing terms by 
insuring that non-disclosure agreements existed and that contract language 
assured compliance with the vendors' licensing policies. 
We believe MOUs and IGAs can be used as templates of information 
sharing agreements and contracts, and can serve as a component of an IS1 
partnership framework. A sample MOU template is shown in Figure 11-2. 
Institutions and agencies are encouraged to freely adopt and modify this 
template for their purposes. 
11.4 The COPLINK Chronicle 
We include below a chronicle of funding, research and development, and 
media reports of relevance to our COPLINK project. Many agencies, 
partners, and individuals have contributed significantly to the success of this 
program, which has grown from its humble academic research roots to wide- 
spread deployment and impact in public safety and homeland security. 
The COPLINK system, which has been cited as a national model for 
public safety information sharing and analysis, has been adopted in more 
than 100 law enforcement and intelligence agencies. The COPLINK 
research had been featured in the New York Times, Newsweek, Los Angeles 
Times, Washington Post, and Boston Globe, among others. The COPLINK 
project was selected as a finalist in 2003 for the prestigious International 
The Partnership and Collaboration Framework 149 
Association of Chiefs of Police (1ACP)IMotorola 2003 Webber Seavey 
Award for Quality in Law Enforcement. COPLINK research has recently 
been expanded to border protection (Bordersafe), disease and bioagent 
surveillance (BioPortal), and terrorism informatics research (Dark Web), 
funded by the NSF, CIA, and DHS.

11.5 Future Directions 
Forming a sustainable, win-win collaboration partnership between 
academics and selected law enforcement or intelligence agencies is difficult 
and, yet, potentially fruitful. In our COPLINK experience, we have seen that 
such a collaboration bears fruits in scientific innovation and social impact. 
We believe that we have made significant contributions to information 
sharing, crime data mining, deception detection, criminal network analysis, 
and disease surveillance research. We have also witnessed, first-hand, 
criminals arrested and lives saved as a result of public safety agencies using 
our technologies. 
In the next decade, we envision significant breakthroughs in several 
areas. The BorderSafe project will continue to contribute to border safety 
and cross-jurisdictional criminal network analysis research. The Dark Web 
project will help create an invaluable terrorism research testbed and develop 
advanced terrorism analysis methods. The BioPortal project will contribute 
to the development of a national or even international infectious disease and 
bioagent information sharing and analysis system.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE 
DIRECTIONS 
Conclusions and Future Directions 
In this book, we discuss technical issues regarding intelligence and 
security informatics (ISI) research to accomplish the critical missions of 
national security. We propose a research framework addressing the technical 
challenges facing counter-terrorism and crime-fighting applications with a 
primary focus on the knowledge discovery from databases (KDD) 
perspective. We identify and incorporate in the framework six classes of IS1 
technologies: information sharing and collaboration, crime association 
mining, crime classification and clustering, intelligence text mining, spatial 
and temporal analysis of crime patterns, and criminal network analysis. We 
also present a set of COPLINK case studies, ranging from detection of 
criminal identity deception to intelligent web portals for monitoring terrorist 
web sites, demonstrating the potential of IS1 technologies in contributing to 
the critical missions of national security. 
As this new IS1 discipline continues to evolve and advance, several 
important directions need to be pursued, including technology development, 
testbed creation, and social, organizational, and policy studies. 
New technologies need to be developed and many existing information 
technologies should be re-examined and adapted for national security 
applications. The knowledge discovery perspective provides a promising 
direction. However, new technologies should be developed in a legal and 
ethical framework without compromising the privacy or civil liberties of 
citizens. 
Large-scale, non-sensitive data testbeds consisting of data from diverse, 
authoritative, and open sources and in different formats should be created 
and made available to the IS1 research community. Lack of real research 
data has been a long-standing problem in intelligence- and security- 
related research. Many researchers are forced to use simulated or 
synthetic data that may not resemble true crime data characteristics. 
Furthermore, comparing competing technical approaches has been 
difficult because of the lack of standard testing collections. A 
comprehensive and non-sensitive open source data collection, analogous 
to the MUC (Message Understanding Conference) collection, will be of 
great value for IS1 researchers to experiment with, test, and evaluate 
various technologies, and to compare and share findings, insights, and 
knowledge. Advanced methods may need to be employed to scrub data 
contained in the non-open source testbed to ensure data confidentiality 
while preserving its characteristics and underlying structures. 
The ultimate goal of IS1 research is to enhance our national security. 
However, the question of how this type of research has impacted and will 
impact society, organizations, and the general public remains 
156 INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY INFORMATICS 
unanswered. Researchers from social sciences, political sciences, 
organizational and management sciences, psychology, and education may 
contribute substantially to this aspect. 
We hope active IS1 research will help improve knowledge discovery and 
dissemination and enhance information sharing and collaboration among 
academics, local, state, and federal agencies, and industry, thereby bringing 
positive impacts to all aspects of our society.
