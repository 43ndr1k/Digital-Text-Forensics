Authorship Attribution through Function
Word Adjacency Networks
Santiago Segarra, Mark Eisen, and Alejandro Ribeiro
Abstract—A method for authorship attribution based on func-
tion word adjacency networks (WANs) is introduced. Function
words are parts of speech that express grammatical relationships
between other words but do not carry lexical meaning on their
own. In the WANs in this paper, nodes are function words and
directed edges stand in for the likelihood of finding the sink word
in the ordered vicinity of the source word. WANs of different
authors can be interpreted as transition probabilities of a Markov
chain and are therefore compared in terms of their relative
entropies. Optimal selection of WAN parameters is studied and
attribution accuracy is benchmarked across a diverse pool of
authors and varying text lengths. This analysis shows that, since
function words are independent of content, their use tends to be
specific to an author and that the relational data captured by
function WANs is a good summary of stylometric fingerprints.
Attribution accuracy is observed to exceed the one achieved by
methods that rely on word frequencies alone. Further combining
WANs with methods that rely on word frequencies alone, results
in larger attribution accuracy, indicating that both sources of
information encode different aspects of authorial styles.
I. INTRODUCTION
The discipline of authorship attribution is concerned with
matching a text of unknown or disputed authorship to one
of a group of potential candidates. More generally, it can
be seen as a way of quantifying literary style or uncovering
a stylometric fingerprint. The most traditional application of
authorship attribution is literary research, but it has also been
applied in forensics [2], defense intelligence [3] and plagiarism
[4]. Both, the availability of electronic texts and advances
in computational power and information processing, have
boosted accuracy and interest in computer based authorship
attribution methods [5]–[7].
Authorship attribution dates at least to more than a century
ago with a work that proposed distinguishing authors by
looking at word lengths [8]. This was later improved by
[9] where the average length of sentences was considered as
a determinant. A seminal development was the introduction
of the analysis of function words to characterize authors’
styles [10] which inspired the development of several methods.
Function words are words like prepositions, conjunctions, and
pronouns which on their own carry little meaning but dictate
the grammatical relationships between words. The advantage
of function words is that they are content independent and,
thus, can carry information about the author that is not biased
by the topic of the text being analyzed. Since [10], function

words appeared in a number of papers where the analysis of
the frequency with which different words appear in a text plays
a central role one way or another; see e.g., [11]–[14]. Other
attribution methods include the stylometric techniques in [15],
the use of vocabulary richness as a stylometric marker [16]–
[18] – see also [19] for a critique –, the use of stable words
defined as those that can be replaced by an equivalent [20],
and syntactical markers such as taggers of parts of speech [21].
In this paper, we use function words to build stylometric
fingerprints but, instead of focusing on their frequency of
usage, we consider their relational structure. We encode these
structures as word adjacency networks (WANs) which are
asymmetric networks that store information of co-appearance
of two function words in the same sentence (Section III). With
proper normalization, edges of these networks describe the
likelihood that a particular function word is encountered in
the text given that we encountered another one. In turn, this
implies that WANs can be reinterpreted as Markov chains de-
scribing transition probabilities between function words. Given
this interpretation it is natural to measure the dissimilarity
between different texts in terms of the relative entropy between
the associated Markov chains (Section III-A). Markov chains
have also been used as a tool for authorship attribution in [22],
[23]. However, the chains in these works represent transitions
between letters, not words. Although there is little intuitive
reasoning behind the notion that an author’s style can be
modeled by his usage of individual letters, these approaches
generate somewhat positive results.
The classification accuracy of WANs depends on various
parameters regarding the generation of the WANs as well as
the selection of words chosen as network nodes. We consider
the optimal selection of these parameters and develop an
adaptive strategy to pick the best network node set given the
texts to attribute (Section IV). Using a corpus composed of
texts by 21 authors from the 19th century, we illustrate the
implementation of our method and analyze the changes in
accuracy when modifying the number of candidate authors
as well as the length of the text of known (Section V-A)
and unknown (Section V-B) authorship. Further, we analyze
how the similarity of styles between two authors influences
the accuracy when distinguishing their texts (Section V-C).
We then incorporate authors from the early 17th century
to the corpus and analyze how differences in time period,
genre, and gender influence the classification rate of WANs
(Sections VI-A to VI-C). We also show that WANs can be
used to detect collaboration between several authors (Section
VI-D). We further demonstrate that our classifier performs
better than techniques based on function word frequencies
2
alone (Section VII). Perhaps more important, we show that the
stylometric information captured by WANs is not the same as
the information captured by word frequencies. Consequently,
their combination results in a further increase in classification
accuracy.
II. PROBLEM FORMULATION
We are given a set of n authors A = {a1, a2, ..., an}, a set
of m known texts T = {t1, t2, ..., tm} and a set of k unknown
texts U = {u1, u2, ..., uk}. We are also given an authorship
attribution function rT : T → A mapping every known text
in T to its corresponding author in A, i.e. rT (t) ∈ A is the
author of text t for all t ∈ T . We further assume rT to be
surjective, this implies that for every author ai ∈ A there is at
least one text tj ∈ T with rT (tj) = ai. Denote as T (i) ⊂ T
the subset of known texts written by author ai, i.e.
T (i) = {t | t ∈ T, rT (t) = ai}. (1)
According to the above discussion, it must be that |T (i)| > 0
for all i and {T (i)}ni=1 must be a partition of T . In Section
III, we use the texts contained in T (i) to generate a relational
profile for author ai. There exists an unknown attribution
function rU : U → A which assigns each text u ∈ U to
its actual author rU (u) ∈ A. Our objective is to approximate
this unknown function with an estimator r̂U built with the
information provided by the attribution function rT . In partic-
ular, we construct word adjacency networks (WANs) for the
known texts t ∈ T and unknown texts u ∈ U . We attribute
texts by comparing the WANs of the unknown texts u ∈ U to
the WANs of the known texts t ∈ T .
In constructing WANs, the concepts of sentence, proximity,
and function words are important. Every text consists of a
sequence of sentences, where a sentence is defined as an
indexed sequence of words between two stopper symbols. We
think of these symbols as grammatical sentence delimiters,
but this is not required. For a given sentence, we define
a directed proximity between two words parametric on a
discount factor α ∈ (0, 1) and a window length D. If we
denote as i(ω) the position of word ω within its sentence the
directed proximity d(ω1, ω2) from word ω1 to word ω2 when
0 < i(ω2)− i(ω1) ≤ D is defined as
d(ω1, ω2) := α
i(ω2)−i(ω1)−1. (2)
In every sentence there are two kind of words: function and
non-function words [24]. While in (2) the words w1 and w2
need not be function words, in this paper we are interested
only in the case in which both w1 and w2 are function words.
Function words are words that express primarily a grammatical
relationship. These words include conjunctions (e.g., and, or),
prepositions (e.g., in, at), quantifiers (e.g., some, all), modals
(e.g., may, could), and determiners (e.g., the, that). We exclude
gender specific pronouns (he, she) as well as pronouns that
depend on narration type (I, you) from the set of function
words to avoid biased similarity between texts written using
the same grammatical person – see Section III for details. The
30 function words that appear most often in our experiments
are listed in Table I. The concepts of sentence, proximity, and
function words are illustrated in the following example.

Example 1 Define the set of stopper symbols as {. ; }, let the
parameter α = 0.8, the window D = 4, and consider the text
“A swarm in May is worth a load of hay; a swarm in
June is worth a silver spoon; but a swarm in July is not
worth a fly.”
The text is composed of three sentences separated by the
delimiter { ; }. We then divide the text into its three constituent
sentences and highlight the function words
a swarm in May is worth a load of hay
a swarm in June is worth a silver spoon
but a swarm in July is not worth a fly
The directed proximity from the first a to swarm in the first
sentence is α0 = 1 and the directed proximity from the first
a to in is α1 = 0.8. The directed proximity to worth or load
is 0 because the indices of these words differ in more than
D = 4.
Define the classification accuracy as the fraction of unknown
texts that are correctly attributed. With I denoting the indicator
function we can write the classification accuracy ρ as
ρ(r̂U ) =

We use ρ(r̂U ) to gauge performance of the classifier in
Sections IV to VII.
III. FUNCTION WORDS ADJACENCY NETWORKS
As relational structures we construct WANs for each text.
These weighted and directed networks contain function words
as nodes. The weight of a given edge represents the likelihood
of finding the words connected by this edge close to each other
in the text. Formally, from a given text t we construct the
network Wt = (F,Qt) where F = {f1, f2, ..., ff} is the set
of nodes composed by a collection of function words common
to all WANs being compared and Qt : F × F → R+ is a
similarity measure between pairs of nodes. Methods to select
the elements of the node set F are discussed in Section IV.
In order to calculate the similarity function Qt, we first
divide the text t into sentences sht where h ranges from 1 to
the total number of sentences. We denote by sht (e) the word
in the e-th position within sentence h of text t. In this way,
we define
Qt(fi, fj) =
∑
h,e
I{sht (e) = fi}
D∑
d=1
αd−1 I{sht (e+ d) = fj},
(4)
for all fi, fj ∈ F , where α ∈ (0, 1) is the discount factor that
decreases the assigned weight as the words are found further
apart from each other and D is the window limit to consider
that two words are related. The similarity measure in (4) is
the sum of the directed proximities from fi to fj defined in
3
(2) for all appearances of fi when the words are found at
most D positions apart in the same sentence. Since in general
Qt(fi, fj) 6= Qt(fj , fi), the WANs generated are directed.
Example 2 Consider the same text and parameters of Exam-
ple 1. There are four function words yielding the set F =
{a, in, of, but}. The matrix representation of the similarity
function Qt is
Qt =

a in of but
a 0 3× 0.81 0.81 0
in 2× 0.83 0 0 0
of 0 0 0 0
but 1 0.82 0 0
. (5)
The total similarity value from a to in is obtained by summing
up the three 0.81 proximity values that appear in each sen-
tence. Although the word a appears twice in every sentence,
Q(a, a) = 0 because its appearances are more than D = 4
words apart.
Using text WANs, we generate a network Wc for every
author ac ∈ A as Wc = (F,Qc) where
Qc =
∑
t∈T (c)
Qt. (6)
Similarities in Qc depend on the amount and length of the
texts written by author ac. This is undesirable since we want
to be able to compare relational structures among different
authors. Hence, we normalize the similarity measures as
Q̂c(fi, fj) =
Qc(fi, fj)∑
j Qc(fi, fj)
, (7)
for all fi, fj ∈ F . In this way, we achieve normalized networks
P̂c = (F, Q̂c) for each author ac. In (7) we assume that there
is at least one positively weighted edge out of every node fi
so that we are not dividing by zero. If this is not the case for
some function word fi, we fix Q̂c(fi, fj) = 1/|F | for all fj .
Example 3 By applying normalization (7) to the similarity
function in Example 2, we obtain the following normalized
similarity matrix
Q̂t =

a in of but
a 0 0.75 0.25 0
in 1 0 0 0
of 0.25 0.25 0.25 0.25
but 0.61 0.39 0 0
. (8)
Similarity Q̂t no longer depends on the length of the text t
but on the relative frequency of the co-appearances of function
words in the text.
Our claim is that every author ac has an inherent relational
structure Pc that serves as an authorial fingerprint and can be
used towards the solution of authorship attribution problems.
P̂c = (F, Q̂c) estimates Pc with the available known texts
written by author ac.
A. Network Similarity
The normalized networks P̂c can be interpreted as discrete
time Markov chains (MC) since the similarities out of every
node sum up to 1. Thus, the normalized similarity between
words fi and fj is a measure of the probability of finding fj
in the words following an encounter of fi. In a similar manner,
we can build a MC Pu for each unknown text u ∈ U .
Since every MC has the same state space F , we use the
relative entropy H(P1, P2) as a dissimilarity measure between
the chains P1 and P2. The relative entropy is given by
H(P1, P2) =
∑
i,j
π(fi)P1(fi, fj) log
P1(fi, fj)
P2(fi, fj)
, (9)
where π is the limiting distribution on P1 and we consider
0 log 0 to be equal to 0. The choice of H as a measure of
dissimilarity is not arbitrary. In fact, if we denote as w1 a
realization of the MC P1, H(P1, P2) is proportional to the
logarithm of the ratio between the probability that w1 is a
realization of P1 and the probability that w1 is a realization
of P2. In particular, when H(P1, P2) is null, the ratio is 1
meaning that a given realization of P1 has the same probability
of being observed in both MCs [25]. We point out that relative
entropy measures have also been used to compare vectors
with function word frequencies [26]. This is unrelated to their
use here as measures of the relational information captured in
function WANs.
Using (9), we generate the attribution function r̂U (u) by
assigning the text u to the author with the most similar
relational structure
r̂U (u) = ap, where p = argmin
c
H(Pu, P̂c). (10)
Whenever a transition between words appears in an unknown
text but not in a profile, the relative entropy in (10) takes
an infinite value for the corresponding author. In practice we
compute the relative entropy in (9) by summing over the non-
zero transitions in the profiles,
H(P1, P2) =
∑
i,j|P2(fi,fj) 6=0
π(fi)P1(fi, fj) log
P1(fi, fj)
P2(fi, fj)
.
(11)
Observe that if there is a transition between words that appears
often in the text P1 but never in the profile P2, the expression
in (11) skips the relative entropy summand. This is undesirable
because the often appearance of this transition in the text
network P1 is a strong indication that this text was not written
by the author whose profile network is P2. The expression
in (9) would capture this difference by producing an infinite
value for the relative entropy. However, this infinite value is
still produced if a transition between words does not appear
in the author profile P2 and appears just once in the text P1.
In this case, the null contribution to the relative entropy in
(11) is more reasonable than the infinity contribution in (9)
because the rarity of the transition in both texts is an indication
that the text and the profile belong to the same author. Our
experiments show that the latter situation is more common than
the former. Transitions rare enough so as not to appear in a
profile are, for the most part, also infrequent in all texts. This
4
is reasonable because rare combinations of function words are
properties of the language more than of individual authors.
We have also explored the use of Laplace smoothing to avoid
infinite entropies – see e.g., [27, Chapter 13], but (11) still
achieves best results in practice.
We proceed to specify the selection of function words in
F as well as the choice of the parameters α and D after the
following remark.
Remark 1 For the relative entropies in (10) to be well de-
fined, the MCs Pu associated with the unknown texts have to
be ergodic to ensure that the limiting distributions π in (9)
and (11) are unique. This is true if the texts that generated
Pu are sufficiently long. If this is not true for a particular
network, we replace π(fi) with the expected fraction of time
a randomly initialized walk spends in state fi. The random
initial function word is drawn from a distribution given by the
word frequencies in the text.
IV. SELECTION OF FUNCTION WORDS AND WAN
PARAMETERS
The classification accuracy of the function WANs intro-
duced in Section III depends on the choice of several variables
and parameters: the set of sentence delimiters or stopper
symbols, the window length D, the discount factor α, and the
set of function words F defining the nodes of the adjacency
networks. In this section, we study the selection of these
parameters to maximize classification accuracy.
The selections of stopper symbols and window lengths are
not critical. As stoppers we include the grammatical sentence
delimiters ‘.’, ‘?’ and ‘!’, as well as semicolons ‘;’ to form
the stopper set {. ? ! ;}. We include semicolons since they
are used primarily to connect two independent clauses [24].
In any event, the inclusion or not of the semicolon as a stopper
symbol entails a minor change in the generation of WANs due
to its infrequent use. As window length we pick D = 10, i.e.,
we consider that two words are not related if they appear more
than 10 positions apart from each other. Larger values of D
lead to higher computational complexity without increase in
accuracy since grammatical relations of words more than 10
positions apart are rare.
In order to choose which function words to include when
generating the WANs we present two different approaches: a
static methodology and an adaptive strategy. The static ap-
proach consists in picking the function words most frequently
used in the union of all the texts being considered in the attri-
bution, i.e, all those that we use to build the profile and those
being attributed. By using the most frequent function words
we base the attribution on repeated grammatical structures and
limit the influence of noise introduced by unusual sequences
of words which are not consistent stylometric markers. In
our experiments, we see that selecting a number of functions
words between 40 and 70 yields optimal accuracy. For way of
illustration, we consider in Fig. 1a the attribution of 1,000
texts of length 10,000 words among 7 authors chosen at
random from our pool of 19th century authors [28] for a fixed
value of α = 0.75 and profiles of 100,000 words – see also
Section V for a description of the corpus. The solid line in this
figure represents the accuracy achieved when using a network
composed of the n most common function words in the texts
analyzed for n going from 2 to 100. Accuracy is maximal
when we use exactly 50 function words, but the differences
are minimal and likely due to random variations for values of
n between n = 42 and n = 66. The flatness of the accuracy
curve is convenient because it shows that the selection of n
is not that critical. In this particular example we can choose
any value between, say n = 45 and n = 60, without affecting
reliability. In a larger test where we also vary the length of the
profiles, the length of the texts attributed, and the number of
candidate authors, we find that including 60 function words is
empirically optimal.
The adaptive approach still uses the most common function
words but adapts the number of function words used to the
specific attribution problem. In order to choose the number of
function words, we implement repeated leave-one-out cross
validation as follows. For every candidate author ai ∈ A, we
concatenate all the known texts T (i) written by ai and then
break up this collection into N pieces of equal length. We
build a profile for each author by randomly picking N − 1
pieces for each of them. We then attribute the unused pieces
between the authors utilizing WANs of n function words for
n varying in a given interval [nmin, nmax]. We perform M of
these cross validation rounds in which we change the random
selection of the N−1 texts that build the profiles. The value of
n that maximizes accuracy across these M trials is selected as
the number of nodes for the WANs. We perform attributions
using the corresponding n word WANs for the profiles as well
as for the texts to be attributed. In our numerical experiments
we have found that using N = 10, nmin = 20, nmax = 80,
and M varying between 10 and 100 depending on the available
computation time are sufficient to find values of n that yield
good performance.
The dashed line in Fig. 1a represents the accuracy obtained
by implementing the adaptive strategy with N = 10, nmin =
20, nmax = 80, and M = 100 for the same attribution problem
considered in the static method – i.e., attribution of 1,000 texts
of length 10,000 words among 7 authors for α = 0.75 and
profiles of 100,000 words. The accuracy is very similar to the
best correct classification rate achieved by the static method.
This is not just true of this particular example but also true
in general. The static approach is faster because it requires no
online training to select the number of words n to use in the
WANs. The adaptive strategy is suitable for a wider range
of problems because it contains less assumptions than the
static method about the best structure to differentiate between
the candidate authors. E.g., when shorter texts are analyzed,
experiments show that the optimal static method uses slightly
less than 60 words. Likewise, the optimal choice of the number
of words in the WANs changes slightly with the time period
of the authors, the specific authors considered, and the choice
of parameter α. These changes are captured by the adaptive
approach. We advocate adaptation in general and reserve the
static method for rapid attribution of texts or cases when the
number of texts available to build profiles is too small for
effective cross-validation.

The dashed line is the accuracy obtained by the adaptive method. (b) Accuracy is maximized for values of the discount factor
α in the range between 0.70 and 0.85.
To select the decay parameter we use the adaptive leave-
one-out cross validation method for different values of α and
study the variation of the correct classification rate as α varies.
In Fig. 1b we show the variation of the correct classification
rate with α when attributing 1,000 texts of length 10,000 words
between 7 authors of the 19th century picked at random from
our text corpus [28] using profiles with 100,000 words – see
also Section V for a description of the corpus. As in the case
of the number of words used in the WANs there is a wide
range of values for which variations are minimal and likely
due to randomness. This range lies approximately between
α = 0.7 and α = 0.85. In a larger test where we also vary
text and profile lengths as well as the number of candidate
authors we find that α = 0.75 is optimal. We found no gains
in an adaptive method to choose α.
V. ATTRIBUTION ACCURACY
Henceforth, we fix the WAN generation parameters to the
optimal values found in Section IV, i.e., the set of sentence
delimiters is { . ? ! ; }, the discount factor is α = 0.75, and
the window length is D = 10. The set of function words F is
picked adaptively for every attribution problem by performing
M = 10 cross validation rounds.
The text corpus used for the simulations consists of authors
from two different periods [28]. The first group corresponds to
21 authors spanning the 19th century, both American – such
as Nathaniel Hawthorne and Herman Melville – and British
– such as Jane Austen and Charles Dickens. For these 21
authors, we have an average of 6.5 books per author with a
minimum of 4 books for Charlotte Bronte and a maximum
of 10 books for Herman Melville and Mark Twain. In terms
of words, this translates into an average of 560,000 words
available per author with a minimum of 284,000 words for
Louisa May Alcott and a maximum of 1,096,000 for Mark
Twain. The second group of authors corresponds to 7 Early
Modern English playwrights spanning the late 16th century
and the early 17th century, namely William Shakespeare,
George Chapman, John Fletcher, Ben Jonson, Christopher
Marlowe, Thomas Middleton, and George Peele. For these
authors we have an average of 22 plays per author with a
minimum of 4 plays for Peele and a maximum of 47 plays
written either completely or partially by Fletcher. In terms
of word length, we count with an average length of 400,000
words per author with a minimum of 50,000 for Peele and a
maximum of 900,000 for Fletcher.
To illustrate authorship attribution with function WANs, we
solve an authorship attribution problem with two candidate
authors: Mark Twain and Herman Melville. For each candidate
author we are given five known texts and are asked to attribute
ten unknown texts, five of which were written by Twain while
the other five belong to Melville [28]. Every text in this
attribution belongs to a different book and corresponds to a
10,000 word extract, i.e. around 25 pages of a paper back
midsize edition. The five known texts from each author are
used to generate corresponding profiles as described in Section
III. Relative entropies in (11) from each of the ten unknown
texts to each of the two resulting profiles are then computed.
Since relative entropies are not metrics, we use multidimen-
sional scaling (MDS) [29] to embed the two profiles and the
ten unknown texts in 2-dimensional Euclidean metric space
with minimum distortion. The result is illustrated in Fig.
2a. Twain’s and Melville’s profiles are depicted as red and
blue filled circles, respectively. Unknown texts are depicted as
empty circles, where the color indicates the real author, i.e. red
for Twain and blue for Melville. A solid black line composed
of points equidistant to both profiles is also plotted. This line
delimits the two half planes that result in attribution to one
author or the other. From Fig. 2a, we see that the attribution
is perfect for these two authors. All red (Twain) empty circles
fall in the half plane closer to the filled red circle and all
blue (Melville) empty circles fall in the half plane closer to
the filled blue circle. We emphasize that the WAN attributions
are not based on these Euclidean distances but on the non-
metric dissimilarities given by the relative entropies. Since

the number of points is small, the MDS distortion is minor
and the distances in Fig. 2a are close to the relative entropies.
The latter separate the points better, i.e., relative entropies are
smaller for texts of the same author and larger for texts of
different authors.
We also illustrate an attribution between three authors by
creating a profile for Jane Austen using five 10,000 word
excerpts and adding five 10,000 word excerpts of texts written
by Jane Austen to the ten excerpts to attribute from Twain and
Melville’s books. We then perform an attribution of the 15
texts to the three profiles constructed. An MDS approximate
representation of the relative entropies between texts and
profiles is shown in Fig. 2b where filled circles represent
profiles and empty circles represent texts. Different colors are
used to distinguish Twain (red), Melville (blue), and Austen
(green). We also plot the Voronoi tessellation induced by the
three profiles, which specify the regions of the plane that are
attributable to each author. Different from the case in Fig.
2a, attribution is not perfect since one of Austen’s texts is
mistakenly attributed to Melville. This is represented in Fig
2b by the green empty circle that appears in the section of the
Voronoi tessellation that corresponds to the blue profile.
Besides the number of authors, the other principal de-
terminants of classification accuracy are the length of the
profiles, the length of the texts of unknown authorship, and
the similarity of writing styles as captured by the relative
entropy dissimilarities between profiles. We study these effects
in sections V-A,V-B, and V-C, respectively.
A. Varying Profile Length
The profile length is defined as the total number of words,
function or otherwise, used to construct the profile. To study
the effect of varying profile lengths we fix α = 0.75, D = 10,
and vary the length of author profiles from 10,000 to 100,000
words in increments of 10,000 words. For each profile length,
we attribute texts containing 25,000, 5,000 and 1,000 words,
and for each given combination of profile and text length,
we consider problems ranging from binary attribution to
attribution between ten authors. To build profiles, we use ten
texts of the same length randomly chosen among all the texts
written by a given author. The length of each excerpt is such
that the ten pieces add up to the desired profile length. E.g.,
to build a profile of length 50,000 words for Melville, we
randomly pick ten excerpts of 5,000 words each among all the
texts written by him. For the texts to be attributed, however, we
always select contiguous extracts of the desired length. E.g.,
for texts of length 25,000 words, we randomly pick excerpts
of this length written by some author – as opposed to the
selection of ten pieces of different origin we do for the profiles.
This resembles the usual situation where the profiles are built
from several sources but the texts to attribute correspond to a
single literary creation. For a given profile size and number of
authors, several attribution experiments were ran by randomly
choosing the set of authors among those from the 19th century
[28] and randomly choosing the texts forming the profiles. The
amount of attribution experiments was chosen large enough to
ensure that every accuracy value in tables II - IV is based on
the attribution of at least 600 texts.
The accuracy results of attributing a text of 25,000 words
are stated in Table II. This word length is equivalent to around
60 pages of a midsize paperback novel – i.e., a novella, or a
few book chapters – or the typical length of a Shakespeare
play. In the last column of the table we inform the expected
accuracy of random attribution between the candidate authors.
The difference between the accuracies of the last column and
the rest of the table indicates that WANs do carry stylometric
information useful for authorship attribution. Overall, attri-
bution of texts with 25,000 words can be done with high
accuracy even when attributing among a large number of
authors if reasonably large corpora are available to build author

TABLE IV: Profile length vs. accuracy for different number of authors (text length = 1,000)
profiles with 60,000 to 100,000 words. E.g., for a profile
containing 40,000 words, our method achieves an accuracy
of 0.985 for binary attributions whereas the corresponding
random accuracy is 0.5. As expected, accuracy decreases when
the number of candidate authors increases. E.g., for profiles
of 80,000 words, an accuracy of 0.986 is obtained for binary
attributions whereas an accuracy of 0.935 is obtained when
the pool of candidates contains ten authors. Observe that
accuracy does not monotonically decrease when increasing the
candidate authors due to the noise introduced by the random
selection of authors and texts.
Accuracy increases with longer profiles. E.g., when per-
forming attributions of 25,000 word texts among 6 authors,
the accuracy obtained for profiles of length 10,000 is 0.760
whereas the accuracy obtained for profiles of length 60,000
is 0.941. There is a saturation effect concerning the length
of the profile that depends on the number of authors being
considered. For binary attributions there is no major increase
in accuracy beyond profiles of length 30,000. However, when
the number of candidate authors is 7, accuracy stabilizes for
profiles of length in the order of 80,000 words. There seems to
be little benefit in using profiles containing more than 100,000
words, which corresponds to a short novel of about 250 pages.
Correct attribution rates of shorter excerpts containing 5,000
words are shown in Table III for the same profile lengths
and number of candidate authors considered in Table II. A
text of this length corresponds to about 13 pages of a novel
– something in the order of the chapter of a book – or an
act in a Shakespeare play. When considering these shorter
texts, acceptable classification accuracy is achieved except for
very short profiles and large number of authors, while reliable
attribution requires a small number of candidate authors or
a large profile. E.g., attribution between three authors with
profiles of 70,000 words has an average accuracy of 0.943.
While smaller than the corresponding correct attribution rate of
0.982 for texts of length 25,000 words, this is still a respectable
number. To achieve an accuracy in excess of 0.9 for the case
of three authors we need a profile of at least 50,000 words.
For very short texts of 1,000 words, which is about the
length of an opinion piece in a newspaper, a couple pages in
a novel, or a scene in a Shakespeare play, we can provide
indications of authorship but cannot make definitive claims.
As shown in Table IV, the best accuracies are for binary
attributions that hover at around 0.8 when we use profiles
longer than 40,000 words. For attributions between more than
2 authors, maximum correct attribution rates are achieved for
profiles containing 90,000 or 100,000 words and range from
0.757 for the case of three authors to 0.556 when considering
8
ten authors. These rates are markedly better than random
attribution but not sufficient for definitive statements. The
results can be of use as circumstantial evidence in support
of attribution claims substantiated by further proof.
B. Varying Text Length
In this section we analyze the effect of text length in
attribution accuracy for varying profile lengths and number
of candidate authors. Using α = 0.75 and D = 10, we
consider profiles of length 100,000, 20,000 and 5,000 words
and vary the number of candidate authors from two to ten.
The text lengths considered are 1,000 words to 6,000 words
in 1,000 word increments, 8,000 words, and 10,000 to 30,000
words in 5,000 word increments. The fine resolution for
short texts permits estimating the shortest texts that can be
attributed accurately. As in Section V-A, for every combination
of number of authors and text length, enough independent
attribution experiments were performed to ensure that every
accuracy value in tables V - VII is based on at least 600
attributions.
For profiles of length 100,000 words, the results are reported
in Table V. As done in tables II-IV, we state the expected
accuracy of random attribution in the last column of the
table. Accuracies reported towards the right end of the table,
i.e. 20,000-30,000 words, correspond to the attribution of a
dramatic play or around 60 pages of a novel, which we will
refer to as long texts. Accuracies for columns in the middle
of the table, i.e. 5,000-8,000 words, correspond to an act in a
dramatic play or between 12 and 20 pages of a novel, which
we will refer to as medium texts. The left columns of this
table, i.e. 1,000-3,000 words, correspond to a scene in a play,
2 to 7 pages in a novel or an article in a newspaper, which we
will refer to as short texts. For the attribution of long texts,
we achieve a mean accuracy of 0.988 for binary attributions
which decreases to an average accuracy of 0.945 when the
number of candidate authors is increased to ten. For medium
texts, the decrease in accuracy is not very significant for binary
attributions, with a mean accuracy of 0.955, but the accuracy
is reduced to 0.856 for attributions among ten authors. The
accuracy is decreased further when attributing short texts, with
a mean accuracy of 0.894 for binary attributions and 0.700 for
the case with ten candidates. This indicates that when profiles
of around 100,000 are available, WANS achieve accuracies
over 0.95 for medium to long texts. For short texts, acceptable
classification rates are achieved if the number of candidate
authors is between two and four.
If we reduce the length of the profiles to 20,000 words,
reasonable accuracies are attained for small pools of candidate
authors; see Table VI. E.g, for binary attributions, the range of
correct classification varies between 0.812 for texts of 1,000
words to 0.969 for texts with 30,000 words. The first of these
numbers means that we can correctly attribute a newspaper
opinion piece with accuracy 0.812 if we are given corpora
of 20 opinion pieces by the candidate authors. The second of
these numbers means that we can correctly attribute a play be-
tween two authors with accuracy 0.969 if we are given corpora
of 20,000 words by the candidate authors. Further reducing the
Fig. 3: Binary attribution accuracy as a function of the inter-
profile dissimilarity. Higher accuracy is attained for attribution
between authors which are more dissimilar.
profile length to 5,000 words results in classification accuracies
that are acceptable only when we consider binary attributions
and texts of at least 10,000 words; see Table VII. For shorter
texts or larger number of candidate authors, WANs can provide
supporting evidence but not definitive proof.
C. Inter-Profile Dissimilarities
Besides the number of candidate authors and the length
of the texts and profiles, the correct attribution of a text
is also dependent on the similarity of the writing styles of
the authors themselves. Indeed, repeated binary attributions
between Henry James and Washington Irving with random
generation of 100,000 word profiles yield a perfect accuracy
of 1.0 on the classification of 400 texts of 10,000 words each.
The same exercise when attributing between Grant Allen and
Robert Louis Stevenson yields a classification rate of 0.91.
This occurs because the stylometric fingerprints of Allen and
Stevenson are harder to distinguish than those of James and
Irving.
Dissimilarity of writing styles can be quantified by com-
puting the relative entropies between the profiles [cf. (11)].
Since relative entropies are asymmetric, i.e., H(P1, P2) 6=
H(P2, P1) in general, we consider the average of the two
relative entropies between two profiles as a measure of their
dissimilarity. For each pair of authors, the relative entropy is
computed based on the set of function words chosen adaptively
to maximize the cross validation accuracy. For the 100,000
word profiles of James and Irving, the inter-profile dissimilar-
ity resulting from the average of relative entropies is 0.184.
The inter-profile dissimilarity between Allen and Stevenson is
0.099. This provides a formal measure of similarity of writing
styles which explains the higher accuracy of attributions
between James and Irving with respect to attributions between
Allen and Stevenson.
The correlation between inter-profile dissimilarities and
attribution accuracy is corroborated by Fig. 3. Each point in
this plot corresponds to the selection of two authors at random
from our pool of 21 authors from the 19th century. For each
pair we select ten texts of 10,000 words each to generate
profiles of length 100,000 words. We then attribute ten of the

TABLE VII: Text length vs. accuracy for different number of authors (profile length = 5,000)
remaining excerpts of length 10,000 words of each of these
two authors among the two profiles and record the correct
attribution rate as well as the dissimilarity between the random
profiles generated. The process is repeated twenty times for
these two authors to produce the average dissimilarity and
accuracy that yield the corresponding point in Fig. 3. E.g.,
consider two randomly chosen authors for which we have 50
excerpts of 10,000 word available. We select ten random texts
to form a profile and attribute 20 out of the remaining 80
excerpts – 10 for each author. After repeating this procedure
twenty times we get the average accuracy of attributing 400
texts of length 10,000 words between the two authors.
Besides the positive correlation between inter-profile dis-
similarities and attribution accuracies, Fig. 3 shows that clas-
sification is perfect for 11 out of 12 instances where the
inter-profile dissimilarity exceeds 0.16. Errors are rare for
profile dissimilarities between 0.10 and 0.16 since correct
classifications average 0.984 and account for at least 0.96
of the attribution results in all but three outliers. For pairs
of authors with dissimilarities smaller than 0.1 the average
accuracy is 0.942.
VI. META ATTRIBUTION STUDIES
WANs can also be used to study problems other than
attribution between authors. In this section we demonstrate
that WANs carry information about time periods, the genre
of the composition, and the gender of the authors. We also
illustrate the use of WANs in detecting collaborations.
A. Time
WANs carry information about the point in time in which
a text was written. If we build random profiles of 200,000
words for Shakespeare, Chapman, and Melville and compute
the inter-profile dissimilarity as in Section V-C, we obtain a
dissimilarity of 0.04 between Shakespeare and Chapman and
of 0.17 between Shakespeare and Melville. Since inter-profile
dissimilarity is a measure of difference in style, this values
are reasonable given that Shakespeare and Chapman were
contemporaries but Melville lived more than two centuries
after them.
To further illustrate this point, in Fig. 4a we plot a two
dimensional MDS representation of the dissimilarity between
eight authors whose profiles were built with all their available
texts in our corpus [28]. Four of the profiles correspond to
early 17th century authors – Shakespeare, Chapman, Jonson,

Fig. 4: (a) Authors from the early 17th century are depicted as blue stars while authors from the 19th century are depicted
as red dots. Inter-profile dissimilarities are small within the groups and large between them. (b) High inter-profile relative
entropies are illustrated with warmer colors. Two groups of authors with small inter-profile relative entropies are apparent: the
first seven correspond to 17th century authors and the rest to 19th century authors.

and Fletcher – and are represented by blue stars while the
other four – Doyle, Melville, Garland, and Allen – correspond
to 19th century authors and are represented by red dots. Notice
that authors tend to have a smaller distance with their contem-
poraries and a larger distance with authors from other periods.
This fact is also illustrated by the heat map of inter-profile
relative entropies in Fig. 4b where bluish colors represent
smaller entropies. Since heat maps allow the representation of
asymmetric data, we directly plot the relative entropies instead
of the symmetrized inter-profile dissimilarities. The first 7
rows and columns correspond to authors of the 17th century
whereas the remaining 21 correspond to authors of the 19th
century, where profiles were built with all the available texts.
Notice that the blocks of blue color along the diagonal are in
perfect correspondence with the time period of the authors,
verifying that WANs can be used to determine the time in
which a text was written. The average entropies among authors
of the 17th century and among those of the 19th century are
0.096 and 0.098 respectively, whereas the average entropies
between authors of different epochs is 0.273. I.e., the relative
entropy between authors of different epochs almost triples that
of authors belonging to the same time period.
B. Genre
Even though function words by themselves do not carry
content, WANs constructed from a text contain, rather sur-
prisingly, information about its genre. We illustrate this fact
in Fig. 5, where we present the relative entropy between 20
pieces of texts written by Shakespeare of length 20,000 words,
where 10 of them are history plays – e.g., Richard II, King
John, Henry VIII – and 10 of them are comedies – e.g., The
Tempest, Measure for Measure, The Merchant of Venice. As
in Fig. 4b, bluish colors in Fig. 5 represent smaller relative
entropies. Two blocks along the diagonal can be distinguish
that coincide with the plays of the two different genres. Indeed,
if we sequentially extract one text from the group and attribute
it to a genre by computing the average relative entropies to the
remaining histories and comedies, the 20 pieces are correctly
attributed to their genre.
More generally, inter-profile dissimilarities between authors
that write in the same genre tend to be smaller than between
authors that write in different genres. As an example, in Table
VIII we compute the dissimilarity between two Shakespeare
profiles – one built with comedies and the other with histories
– and two contemporary authors: Marlowe and Chapman. All
profiles contain 100,000 words formed by randomly picking
10 extracts of 10,000 words. Marlowe never wrote a comedy
and mainly focused on histories – Edward II, The Massacre at
Paris – and tragedies – The Jew of Malta, Dido –, while the
majority of Chapman’s plays are comedies – All Fools, May
Day. Genre choice impacts the inter-profile dissimilarity since
the comedy profile of Shakespeare is closer to Chapman than
to Marlowe and vice versa for the history profile of Shake-
speare. The inter-profile dissimilarity between Shakespeare
profiles is 6.2, which is still smaller than any dissimilarity in
Table VIII. This points towards the conclusion that the identity
of the author is the main determinant of the writing style but
that the genre of the text being written also contributes to
the word choice. In general, two texts of the same author but
different genres are more similar than two texts of the same
genre but different authors which, in turn, are more similar
than two texts of different authors and genres.

C. Gender
Word usage can be used for author profiling [30] and, in
particular, to infer the gender of an author from the written
text. To illustrate this, we divide the 21 authors from the 19th
century [28] into females – five of them – and males. We pick
a gender at random and pick an excerpt of 10,000 words from
any author of the selected gender. We then build two 100,000
words profiles, one containing pieces of texts written by male
authors and the other by female authors. In order to avoid
bias, we do not include any text of the author from which
the text to attribute was chosen in the gender profiles. We
then attribute the chosen text between the two gender profiles.
After repeating this procedure 5,000 times, we obtain a mean
accuracy of 0.63. Although this accuracy is lower than state-
of-the-art gender profiling methods [31], the difference with
random attribution, i.e. accuracy of 0.5, validates the fact that
WANs carry gender information about the authors.
D. Collaborations
WANs can also be used for the attribution of texts written
collaboratively between two or more authors. Since collabora-
tion was a common practice for playwrights in the early 17th
century, we consider the attribution of Early Modern English
plays [28]. For a given play, we compute its relative entropy
to six contemporary authors – Shakespeare, Jonson, Fletcher,
Middleton, Chapman, and Marlowe – by generating 50 random
profiles for each author of length 80,000 words and averaging
the 50 entropies to obtain one representative number. We do
not consider Peele in the analysis due to the short total length
of available texts.

TABLE XI: Relative entropies from Eastward Ho to hybrid
profiles composed of two authors (x100).
When two authors collaborate to write a play, the resulting
word adjacency network is close to the profiles of both authors,
even though these profiles are built with plays of their sole
authorship. As an example, consider the play Two Noble
Kinsmen which is an accepted collaboration between Fletcher
and Shakespeare [32]. In Table IX, we present the relative
entropies between the play and the six analyzed authors.
Notice that the two minimum entropies correspond to those
who collaborated in writing it.
Collaboration can be further confirmed by the construction
of hybrid profiles, i.e. profiles built containing 40,000 words
of two different authors. Each entry in Table X corresponds
to the relative entropy from Two Noble Kinsmen to a hybrid
profile composed by the authors in the row and column of
that entry. Notice that the diagonal of Table X corresponds
to profiles of sole authors and, thus, coincides with Table IX.
The smallest relative entropy in Table X is achieved by the
hybrid profile composed by Fletcher and Shakespeare, which
is consistent with the accepted attribution of the play.
The attribution between hybrid profiles is not always ac-
curate. For example, consider the play Eastward Ho which
is a collaboration between three authors, two of which are
Chapman and Jonson [32]. If we repeat the above procedure
and compute the relative entropies between the play and the
different pure profiles, we see that in fact the two smallest
entropies are achieved for Jonson and Chapman; see the
diagonal in Table XI. However, the smallest entropy in the
whole table is achieved by the hybrid profile composed by
Jonson and Middleton. The hybrid profile of Jonson and
Chapman, the real authors, achieves an entropy of 16.7, which
is the second smallest among all profiles in Table XI.
VII. COMPARISON AND COMBINATION WITH FREQUENCY
BASED METHODS
Machine learning tools have been used to solve attribution
problems by relying on the frequency of appearance of func-

tion words [33]. These methods consider the number of times
an author uses different function words but, unlike WANs,
do not contemplate the order in which the function words
appear. The most common techniques include naive Bayes [34,
Chapter 8], nearest neighbors (NN) [34, Chapter 2], decision
trees (DT) [34, Chapter 14], and support vector machines
(SVM) [34, Chapter 7].
In Table XII we inform the percentage of errors obtained
by different methods when attributing texts of 10,000 words
among profiles of 100,000 words for a number of authors
ranging from two to ten. For a given number of candidate
authors, we randomly pick them from the pool of 19th century
authors [28] and attribute ten excerpts of each of them using
the different methods. We then repeat the random choice of
authors 100 times and average the error rate. For each of
the methods based on function word frequencies, we pick
the set of parameters and preprocessing that minimize the
attribution error rate. E.g., for SVM the error is minimized
when considering a polynomial kernel of degree 3 and normal-
izing the frequencies by text length. For the nearest neighbors
method we consider two strategies based on one (1-NN) and
three (3-NN) nearest neighbors as given by the l2 metric in
Euclidean space. Also, for decision trees we consider two
types of split criteria: the Gini Diversity Index (DT-gdi) and
the cross-entropy (DT-ce) [35].
The WANs achieve a lower attribution error than frequency
based methods; see Table XII. For binary attributions, naive
Bayes and SVM achieve error rates of 2.6% and 2.7% respec-
tively and, thus, outperform nearest neighbors and decision
trees. However, WANs outperform the aforementioned meth-
ods by obtaining an error rate of 1.6%. This implies a reduction
of 38% in the error rate. For 6 authors, WANs achieve an error
rate of 5.3% that outperform SVMs achieving 7.9% entailing a
33% reduction. This trend is consistent across different number
of candidate authors, with WANs achieving an average error
reduction of 29% compared with the best traditional machine
learning method.
More important than the fact that WANs tend to outperform
methods based on word frequencies, is the fact that they carry
different stylometric information. Thus, we can combine both
methodologies to further increase attribution accuracy. In the
last column of Table XII we inform the error rate of majority
voting between WANs and the two best performing frequency
based methods, namely, naive Bayes and SVMs. The error
rates are consistently smaller than those achieved by WANs
and, hence, by the other frequency based methods as well.
E.g., for attributions among four authors, voting achieves an
error of 3.3% compared to an error of 4.6% of WANs. This
corresponds to a 28% reduction in error. Averaging among
attributions for different number of candidate authors, majority
voting entails a reduction of 30% compared with WANs. The
combination of WANs and function word frequencies halves
the attribution error rate with respect to the current state of
the art.
VIII. CONCLUSION
Relational data between function words was used as stylo-
metric information to solve authorship attribution problems.
Normalized word adjacency networks (WANs) were used as
relational structures. We interpreted these networks as Markov
chains in order to facilitate their comparison using relative
entropies. The accuracy of WANs was analyzed for varying
number of candidate authors, text lengths, profile lengths and
different levels of heterogeneity among the candidate authors,
regarding genre, gender, and time period. The method works
best when the corpora of known texts is of substantial length,
when the texts being attributed are long, or when the number
of candidate authors is small. If long profiles are available
– more than 60,000 words, corresponding to 150 pages of
a midsize paperback book –, we demonstrated very high
attribution accuracy for texts longer than a few typical novel
chapters even when attributing between a large number of
authors, high accuracy for texts as long as a play act or a novel
chapter, and reasonable rates for short texts such as newspaper
opinion pieces if the number of candidate authors is small.
WANs were also shown to classify accurately the time period
when a text was written, to acceptably estimate the genre of
a piece, and to have some predictive power on the gender
of the author. The applicability of WANs to identify multiple
authors in collaborative works was also demonstrated. With
regards to existing methods based on the frequency with which
different function words appear in the text, we observed that
WANs exceed their classification accuracy. More importantly,
we showed that WANs and frequencies captured different
stylometric aspects so that their combination is possible and
ends up halving the error rate of existing methods.
